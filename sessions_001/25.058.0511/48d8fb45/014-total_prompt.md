## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DE5F8F6D0>

**output:**
```
0 2 2
2 2 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5F8E950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is larger (10x10) than the output grid (3x3). The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and gray (5).  The output grid seems to focus on a specific area of the input grid, containing only red and white pixels. The gray pixel in the input seems to be ignored. The output appears to be a cropped or selected region of the input.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - red (2)
      - gray (5)

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors:
      - white (0)
      - red (2)

  - observation: output_focus
    description: The output grid contains a subset of the colors and arrangement found in the input grid.

  - observation: gray_ignore
    description: The gray pixel in input is not present in the output

  - observation: relative position
    description: The relative position of the red pixels is conserved from input to output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Objects:** Locate all red (2) colored contiguous pixel groups (objects) within the input grid.

2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** For *one* of the red objects, determine the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) that fully encompasses the red object. The example output suggests the top-left red shape is selected.

3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box from the input grid.

4.  **Output Subgrid:** The extracted subgrid becomes the output grid. Note. If other color objects are within the bounding box, they are removed.

In short, the transformation isolates a specific red object, extracts a bounding box around the object, and returns this as the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
