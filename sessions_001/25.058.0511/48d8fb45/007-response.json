The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), yellow (4), and grey (5). The output grid appears to be a condensed version of the input grid, focusing on the yellow pixels and their relative positions. The grey pixel seems to disappear during processing and has no direct impact on the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
