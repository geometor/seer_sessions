The input grid is larger (10x10) than the output grid (3x3). The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and gray (5).  The output grid seems to focus on a specific area of the input grid, containing only red and white pixels. The gray pixel in the input seems to be ignored. The output appears to be a cropped or selected region of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The example output suggests the top-left red shape is selected.\n\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid defined by this bounding box from the input grid.\n\n4.  **Output Subgrid:** The extracted subgrid becomes the output grid. Note. If other color objects are within the bounding box, they are removed.\n\nIn short, the transformation isolates a specific red object, extracts a bounding box around the object, and returns this as the new grid.\n"
