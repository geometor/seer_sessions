## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 8 0 8 1 8 0
0 8 8 8 0 1 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 8 1 0
0 0 8 1 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 1 0 8 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7B1DDE7AB850>

**output:**
```
8 1 8
1 1 8
8 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DDE485DD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0, 1, and 8 in this example, corresponding to white, blue and azure). The transformation seems to involve selecting a specific region within the input grid and extracting it as the output grid. The positions of blues (1's) and azures (8's) are important to determining the target area.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 9x9
  values: [0, 1, 8]
  objects:
    - type: region
      properties:
        color: mixed
        shape: irregular
      components:
        - color: azure (8)
        - color: blue (1)

output:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  values: [1, 8]
  objects:
    - type: subregion
      properties:
          color: mixed
          shape: rectangular
      components:
         - color: azure(8)
         - color: blue (1)

transformation:
  type: extraction
  parameters:
      region_selection:  top_right_most_contiguous_block_of_1_and_8
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Focus on pixels with values 1 (blue) and 8 (azure).
2.  **Locate Subgrid:** Find all contiguous blocks made of 1 and 8.
3.  **Select Output Block**: Select the 3x3 subgrid composed only of azure and blue that is furthest to the top and right.
4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the selected 3x3 subgrid as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
