Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, focusing on extracting a subgrid defined by blue pixels and their azure neighbors. The subsequent test results reveal that this approach is too narrow and doesn't generalize well to other examples. Some examples require retaining *all* azure pixels, not just those neighboring blue ones. Others might not even involve blue pixels at all. The core issue is that the initial logic was overly specific to the first example and didn't capture the broader, underlying rule.

The strategy to resolve errors is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on identifying the *actual* rule applied, not just the one initially hypothesized.
2.  **Identify Common Elements:** Find common patterns or relationships between inputs and outputs across *all* examples, not just the first.
3.  **Refine the Rule:** Develop a new, more general natural language program that accurately describes the transformation seen in *all* training examples.  This might involve identifying different object types, relationships, or actions.
4.  **Discard Irrelevant Assumptions:**  Be prepared to completely abandon the initial "blue and azure neighbors" concept if it proves inconsistent with the majority of examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get a better sense of the outputs, I will calculate some metrics. Since the code returns lists I will need to conver the results to numpy arrays.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
