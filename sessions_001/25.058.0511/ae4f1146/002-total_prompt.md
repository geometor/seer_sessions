## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 8 8 0 8 1 8 0 0
8 8 8 0 1 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0
0 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 0 0 8 1 8
0 8 1 8 0 0 1 8 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7B1DDE69BAD0>

**output:**
```
8 1 8
1 8 1
1 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5F8FE50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The colors present in the output grid are a subset of those in the input grid, specifically, colors azure (8) and blue (1) with white/background(0) removed. The output grid appears to be a concentrated representation of a pattern found within the input grid. It seems like a specific region within the larger input grid is selected and extracted to create the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid is 9x9, output grid is 3x3"
  - objects:
    - type: "grid"
      properties:
        - name: "input_grid"
          dimensions: [9, 9]
          colors: [0, 1, 8]
        - name: "output_grid"
          dimensions: [3, 3]
          colors: [1, 8]
  - actions:
      - type: "extraction"
        description: "A 3x3 subgrid is extracted from the input grid."
  - relationships:
    - type: "spatial"
      description: "The output grid corresponds to a specific region within the input grid, centered and focused on non-zero, non-background color values."
    - type: color_content
      description: "Only the color values 1 and 8 are preserved in the output, 0 is skipped."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Region:** Locate a region within the input grid. The program focuses on the arrangement of azure (8) and blue (1) pixels, excluding background (0) pixels.

2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the identified target region.

3.  **Filter Colors:** Keep the azure (8) and blue (1) pixels only.

4. **Output:** form the output grid of size 3x3 from the filtered contents.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
