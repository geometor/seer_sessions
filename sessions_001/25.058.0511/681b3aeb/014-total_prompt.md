## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DDF098D50>

**output:**
```
1 1 1
1 3 1
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DDE7AB850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid appears to contain two distinct colored regions: a green (3) region and a blue (1) region, surrounded by a white (0) background. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, combining elements from both colored regions. The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. The relative positions of the blue and green objects appear to be preserved somehow.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_region
    color: green (3)
    shape: irregular, contiguous
    position: center-middle of the input grid
  - id: blue_region
    color: blue (1)
    shape: irregular, contiguous
    position: bottom-left of the input grid
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    shape: fills the remaining space
    position: surrounds the colored regions

actions:
  - type: condensation
    description: Combines and shrinks the colored regions into a smaller grid.

relationships:
  - subject: green_region
    relation: above
    object: blue_region (relative positioning in the output grid appears to be somewhat consistent with the input)
  - subject: output_grid
    relation: smaller_than
    object: input_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of non-white (non-0) pixels in the input grid. In this case, we have a green (3) region and a blue (1) region.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller grid. I will need to figure out a consistent rule on the size.

3.  **Translate Green Region to Output.** Find the minimal bounding box for the green region. Place the green region in output at the bottom, horizontally centered.

4. **Translate Blue Region to Output:** Find the minimal bounding box for the blue region. Place the blue region in output in the row above the green region, horizontally centered.

5. **Result**: the result is a 3x3 grid composed of the bounding boxes of the identified color regions.

I think the trickiest part here is figuring out precisely *how* the input regions are condensed and placed in the output, as the example only gives us one input-output pair. More details would be needed about the exact condensation/resizing method for an accurate transformation on other inputs.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
