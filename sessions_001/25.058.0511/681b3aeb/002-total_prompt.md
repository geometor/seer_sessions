## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DE5E22750>

**output:**
```
3 3 7
3 7 7
3 7 7
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 10x10 grid (input) into a 3x3 grid (output). The input grid contains two distinct colored regions (objects): a green (3) region in the top-left and an orange (7) region in the bottom-right.  The rest of the input grid is filled with white (0) pixels, which seem to be background. The output grid seems to be a compressed representation, retaining only the colored regions and their relative positions. The output maintains the relative spatial arrangement of the colored blocks from the input, though scaled down and without the background.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_region
    color: green (3)
    shape: irregular
    initial_position: top-left
    output_position: top-left
  - id: orange_region
    color: orange (7)
    shape: rectangle
    initial_position: bottom-right
    output_position: top-right
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    shape: fills_grid
    initial_position: everywhere
    output_position: absent

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Extract colored regions, ignoring white background.
  - type: arrangement
    description: Maintain relative positions of extracted regions in a compact 3x3 grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The green and orange regions are diagonally opposed and non-adjacent in both input and output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Scan the input grid and identify contiguous regions of non-white (non-zero) pixels.  Consider each such region as a separate object.
2.  **Discard Background:** Ignore the white (0) pixels, treating them as background.
3.  **Extract Colors:** For each identified colored region, record its color value.
4. **Determine layout**: Record the top, left, bottom, and right most position of each non-zero color.
5.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Place the identified colors into the output grid, maintaining their relative positioning from the compressed bounding box formed in step 4. If multiple colors occupy the same relative space, arrange them as they are arranged in the input.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
