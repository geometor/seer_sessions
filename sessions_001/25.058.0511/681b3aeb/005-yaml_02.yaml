facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid contains multiple colored objects, each a single contiguous region of a unique color.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The colors in the input grid appear in the output grid, maintaining their relative positions.  The input space conceptually maps to a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: |
      The background color (white/0) is always ignored.
  - observation: |
      The objects, while varying in precise size and position, fall within distinct regions corresponding to the 3x3 output grid.
  - observation: |
    The objects colors appear in the output only if they are present in the input.
