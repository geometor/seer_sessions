## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4
0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DDE7394D0>

**output:**
```
6 6 6
4 6 6
4 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5F8DFD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger and sparser, containing two distinct colored regions (yellow and magenta). The output grid is smaller, more compact, and retains the colors from the input, but in a rearranged configuration. The most obvious transformation appears to be a cropping and repositioning of the colored areas. The relative positions of colored blocks are modified.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10x10] #input grid
      elements: pixels
      colors: [white, yellow, magenta]

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3x3] # output grid
      elements: pixels
      colors: [yellow, magenta]

  - type: object_group
    properties:
      color: yellow
      shape: L-shape (inverted)

 - type: object_group
   properties:
      color: magenta
      shape: T-shape
actions:
  - type: crop
    target: input grid
    result: smaller grid

  - type: reposition
    target: object_group
    result: change in relative position.

relationships:
  - input grid contains object groups
  - output grid contains repositioned objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct colored objects (non-white pixel groups) within the input grid. In this example, we find a yellow object, and a magenta object.
2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that encompasses all identified colored objects.
3.  **Crop:** Crop the input grid to the bounding box, and re-arrange sub-grids.
4. **Re-arrange:** Place object groups in the output grid in order based on the bounding box corner coordinates.
    The yellow object, because its bounding box's top-left corner (1,8) is the smaller than the magenta bounding box top left corner (3,3) and its y dimension is larger than the x, it gets placed first.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
