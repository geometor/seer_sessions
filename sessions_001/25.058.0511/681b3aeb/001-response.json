The input grid contains two distinct colored regions (objects): a green (3) region in the top-left and an orange (7) region in the bottom-right.  The rest of the input grid is filled with white (0) pixels, which seem to be background. The output grid seems to be a compressed representation, retaining only the colored regions and their relative positions. The output maintains the relative spatial arrangement of the colored blocks from the input, though scaled down and without the background.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider each such region as a separate object.\n2.  **Discard Background:** Ignore the white (0) pixels, treating them as background.\n3.  **Extract Colors:** For each identified colored region, record its color value.\n4. **Determine layout**: Record the top, left, bottom, and right most position of each non-zero color.\n5.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Place the identified colors into the output grid, maintaining their relative positioning from the compressed bounding box formed in step 4. If multiple colors occupy the same relative space, arrange them as they are arranged in the input.\n\n"
