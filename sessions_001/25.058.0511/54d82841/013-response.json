The input grid transforms into the output grid, seemingly based on a rule related to the position of specific colors and the addition of a new color/element in a specific row. The primary colors involved are azure (8), magenta (6), and yellow (4), with white (0) as a background. It appears the transformation adds yellow (4) pixels to the bottom row (row index 4) of the grid, in the x-position matching white (0) pixels in the second to last row (row index 3).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
