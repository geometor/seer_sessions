## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7B1DE5E217D0>

**output:**
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are white (0) and magenta (6). The output introduces a new color, yellow (4), in the last row. The magenta shapes in the input remain unchanged in the output. It appears the transformation might be adding something new rather than altering existing elements, based on this one example. It is also noticeable that yellow pixels appear only in the bottom row of the output, and have a horizontal distance of 2.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 8
      columns: 8
      colors: [white, magenta, yellow]
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: magenta
      location: varies #need additional examples for precise location/shape rules
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: yellow
      location: bottom row

actions:
    - type: add
      object: pixel
      properties:
          color: yellow
          location:
            row: last
            condition: specific columns # need additional examples
relationships:
  - magenta shapes remain unchanged.
  - yellow pixels are added to the last row
  - yellow pixels are related by location.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Copy the entire input grid to the output grid, maintaining all existing pixels and their colors.
2.  In the last row of the output grid, add yellow pixels in specific columns. In given example, there are two added yellow pixels that have horizontal distance of 2, but additional examples would be needed to verify the generality.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
