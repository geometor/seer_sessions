The primary colors observed are white (0) and magenta (6). The output introduces a new color, yellow (4), in the last row. The magenta shapes in the input remain unchanged in the output. It appears the transformation might be adding something new rather than altering existing elements, based on this one example. It is also noticeable that yellow pixels appear only in the bottom row of the output, and have a horizontal distance of 2.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
