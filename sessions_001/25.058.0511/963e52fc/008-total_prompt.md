## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 3 3 2 3 3 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7B1DDE909950>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 3 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 2 3
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, aiming to understand the transformation from input to output:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input grid appears to have a single horizontal line of alternating red and green pixels, surrounded by white pixels. The output grid seems to be an expansion of this line, creating a wider line using the same pattern while maintaining symmetry.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid with a horizontal line of alternating red and green pixels.
    dimensions:
      height: 5
      width: 7
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
      - color: red (2)
        role: pattern_element
      - color: green (3)
        role: pattern_element

  - type: grid
    description: Output grid, an expanded version of the input line.
    dimensions:
      height: 5
      width: 14
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
      - color: red (2)
        role: pattern_element
      - color: green (3)
        role: pattern_element
    relationships:
      - type: expansion
        from: input_grid.pattern
        to: output_grid.pattern
        rule: "The pattern in input is duplicated to the right to double its original length"

  - type: pattern
    description: Alternating red and green pixels in a horizontal line.
    elements: [red, green, green, red, green, green, red]
    properties:
      orientation: horizontal
      repetition: "alternating colors"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:** Locate the single horizontal line of non-white pixels in the input grid. This line consists of an alternating sequence of red (2) and green (3) pixels.

2.  **Determine the length of the Pattern:** In the input the length of the pattern is 7 pixels

3.  **Expansion:** Duplicate the entire identified pattern, appending it to the right end of the original pattern.

4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input but double the original pattern's width. Place combined pattern in the center row, and keep all other pixels as white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
