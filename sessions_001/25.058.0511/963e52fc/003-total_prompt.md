Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to double the width of the input grid. The central pattern of alternating red (2) and azure (8) pixels in rows 1 and 2 (0-indexed) is extended, while the surrounding white (0) pixels remain unchanged.
"""

    # Initialize the output grid with double the width, filled with white (0)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols * 2), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the input grid rows
    for i in range(rows):
        if i == 1 or i == 2:  # Rows with the alternating pattern (0-indexed)
            # Extend the pattern by duplicating each pixel
            k=0

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
