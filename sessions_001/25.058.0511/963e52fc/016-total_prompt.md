```python
"""
The transformation rule is to horizontally stretch a colored band (alternating blue (1) and red (2) pixels) by duplicating each of its columns while leaving the white (0) background untouched.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_colored_band(grid):
    # Find the rows containing alternating blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    band_rows = []
    for r in range(rows):

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a simple horizontal stretching of a colored band. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more complex transformation rule. The core issue seems to be that the initial assumption of a simple horizontal stretch doesn't hold true for all cases. Specifically, example 2 shows both horizontal AND vertical stretching. The provided code *only* stretches horizontally.

My strategy to resolve this is as follows:

1. **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to how the colored band changes in terms of position, size (width and height), and pattern. The second example has two objects that stretch in different directions.
2. **Identify the True Rule:** Determine the underlying rule that governs the transformation, considering that it might involve more than just horizontal stretching. Look for consistent patterns.
3. **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language description to accurately reflect the observed transformation rule.
4. **Adapt Code (in next phase):** Prepare to modify the Python code to implement the refined rule.

**Metrics and Observations**

I'll use code execution to gather some information about the grids to better understand.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def grid_dims(grid):
    return grid.shape

def grid_diff(grid1, grid2):
    return grid_dims(grid1),grid_dims(grid2)

def count_colors(grid):
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    return dict(zip(unique, counts))

examples = task_data["train"]
example_reports = []

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
  input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
  output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
  transformed_grid = transform(input_grid) # transform defined in previous turn

  report = {
    'example_number': i,
    'input_dims': grid_dims(input_grid),
    'output_dims': grid_dims(output_grid),
    'trans_dims': grid_dims(transformed_grid),
      'match': np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid)
  }
  example_reports.append(report)

print(example_reports)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
