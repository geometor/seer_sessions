Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The input grid seems to be a subset or a cropped version of the output grid. The main feature is two rows of alternating red and azure pixels. The output grid expands the width of these rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each pixel in the original rows is duplicated to the right of itself.\n\n3.  **Preserve other parts:** Keep the rest of the grid (rows 0, 3, and 4) filled with white (0) and same length as extended rows.\n\nIn simpler terms the width of input image is doubled. The central pattern is simply extended, while keeping the surrounding white pixels unchanged.\n"
