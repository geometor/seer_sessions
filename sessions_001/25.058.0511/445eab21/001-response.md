Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into a smaller grid. The input grid contains two distinct shapes, one orange (7) and one azure (8). The output grid consists only of azure (8) pixels, arranged in a 2x2 square. The orange shape and all white (0) pixels are absent from the output. It appears that the transformation is selecting a specific object based on color and possibly shape, and extracting a sub-grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 10x10, output grid is 2x2.
  - object: OrangeShape
    color: orange (7)
    location: Top-left quadrant of input grid.
    shape: Irregular, resembling a reversed 'L'.
  - object: AzureShape
    color: azure (8)
    location: Center-bottom region of input grid.
    shape: Irregular, resembling an 'L'.
  - object: OutputShape
    color: azure (8)
    location: Output grid.
    shape: 2x2 square.
  - relationship: OutputShape is a sub-component of InputShape Azure.
  - action: extraction
    target: AzureShape
    result: OutputShape
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous regions of pixels with the same color within the input grid. Consider these regions as separate objects.
2.  **Filter by Color:** Disregard all objects that are *not* colored azure (8).
3.  **Select Sub-grid:** find, and extract the smallest 2x2 square sub-grid in azure. If no such subgrid exist output nothing.
4. output the sub-grid.
