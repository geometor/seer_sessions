            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to extract a 2x2 yellow subgrid from the top-left corner of a larger yellow square. However, the test results indicate this approach is too restrictive and doesn't capture the full logic of the transformation. The code *correctly* handles the first example pair but fails on the others. This suggests the core concept (extracting a 2x2 region) might be relevant, but the selection criteria for *which* 2x2 region are incorrect. The presence of the red square in the initial description appears to be a red herring. It is the consistent 2x2 output shape that is most significant.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification Reassessment:** We need to move beyond simply looking for yellow and red squares. The other examples suggest the relevant object may be based on adjacency or being \"inside\" of another object.\n\n2.  **Positional Logic:** The \"top-left\" assumption is incorrect. We need to consider other positional relationships or potentially a different selection criteria.\n\n3.  **Consistent Output:** The output is consistently a 2x2 grid, but not necessarily of yellow color. This is the core concept.\n\n**Example and Result Metrics:**\n\nTo get precise information on the example input/outputs, I'll use the `get_objects` function from the previous code, but I can't execute code directly. I must describe the properties mathematically.\n\nHere's how `get_objects` would categorize the objects in each grid in the example.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Yellow Object: Coordinates forming a hollow 5x5 square.\n    *   Red Object: Coordinates forming a solid 3x3 square.\n*   **Output:** 2x2 yellow square matching the top-left corner of the hollow yellow square.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   Yellow Object: Coordinates forming a hollow 7x7 square.\n    *   Red Object: Single pixel, at top left inside yellow square.\n*   **Output:** 2x2 yellow square matching the top-left corner of the hollow yellow square.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *    Yellow object: coordinates for a hollow 9x9 square\n*   **Output:** 2x2 yellow square matching the top-left corner of the hollow yellow square.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: hollow square\n        size: 5x5\n      - color: red\n        shape: solid square\n        size: 3x3\n  output:\n    shape: solid square\n    size: 2x2\n    color: yellow\n    relation_to_input: top-left corner of the yellow hollow square\n\nexample_2:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: hollow square\n        size: 7x7\n      - color: red\n        shape: point\n        size: 1x1\n  output:\n    shape: solid square\n    size: 2x2\n    color: yellow\n    relation_to_input: top-left corner of the yellow hollow square\n\nexample_3:\n  input:\n    objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: hollow square\n          size: 9x9\n  output:\n    shape: solid square\n    size: 2x2\n    color: yellow\n    relation_to_input: top-left corner of the yellow hollow square\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify the largest hollow square object composed of yellow pixels.\n2.  Extract the 2x2 subgrid located at the top-left corner of this hollow square.\n3.  Output this 2x2 subgrid. The output will always be 2x2.\n\nThe presence of other objects (like the red square in example 1) seems irrelevant to the core transformation rule. The defining feature is identifying and extracting a section of a larger hollow square.\n"
