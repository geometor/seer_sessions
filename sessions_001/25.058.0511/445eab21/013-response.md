Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid contains two distinct objects, identifiable by their colors: yellow (4) and red (2). The yellow object forms a larger, hollow square-like shape. The red object forms a smaller, filled square in the bottom right corner. The output grid seems to consist of only a subset of the input. The back ground color is white (0).

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: yellow_object
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: hollow square
    position: occupies the top-left and extends to the middle-right
  - id: red_object
    color: red (2)
    shape: filled square
    position: bottom right corner
  - id: background
    color: white (0)

transformations:
  - action: select
    target: yellow_object
    condition: top-leftmost portion of the object
  - action: output result

relationships:
  - yellow_object contains background
  - red_object and yellow_object do not intersect

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify two primary objects within the input grid: a hollow square composed of yellow pixels and a solid square composed of red pixels.
2.  Locate the portion of the object made of yellow (4) at the top and the left of the grid.
3. extract a 2x2 block.
4.  Output the extracted 2x2 block as the result.
