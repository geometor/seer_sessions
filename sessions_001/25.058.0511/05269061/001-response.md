Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a smaller, distinct pattern in the top-left corner, while the rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be an expansion or tiling of this initial pattern. The colors involved are red (2), azure (8), green (3), and white (0). The core pattern appears to be a 3x3 block in the upper left. The output replaces the white pixels with a repeating pattern derived by extending the columns and rows, with the colors alternating.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [7, 7] # Both input and output have same dimensions.
      elements: pixels
      colors: [red, azure, green, white]
  - type: pattern
    properties:
       dimensions: [3,3]
       location: top-left corner

actions:
  - type: extend
    description: Replaces white pixels with pattern, alternating colors
    properties:
      direction: horizontal and vertical

relationships:
  - type: contains
    description: The grid contains pixels.
  - type: starts_with
    description: The grid transformation starts with the top-left pattern.
  - type: extends
    description: pattern is extended in rows and columns
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the core pattern:** Locate the 3x3 block of non-white pixels in the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Extend the pattern vertically:**
    *   Iterate over the three rows of the initial pattern.
    *   The white pixels in the columns below the non-white pixel will be replaced to create a column of alternating colors.
    *   Starting from the non-white pixel, the next color down should be the color of the original input
    *   Repeat this alternating sequence down the remaining rows.
3.  **Extend the pattern horizontally:**
    *   Iterate over the extended columns from the initial pattern
    *   The white pixels to the right of the non-white pixel will be replaced to create a row of alternating colors.
    *   Starting from the column, the next color to the right should be the color of the original input
    *   Repeat this alternating sequence down the remaining columns.

In essence, the white area of the input grid is filled by extending the initial 3x3 pattern, both vertically and horizontally, using the colors that are present and alternating them.
