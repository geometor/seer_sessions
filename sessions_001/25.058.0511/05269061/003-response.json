            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and examples to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying and extending a 3x3 pattern was partially successful. The first example, which was used to generate the code worked well, but the code does not accurately transform the second example, and only a small part of the third. This indicates that the transformation rule is more complex than a simple extension of the top-left 3x3 pattern. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of how the pattern is extended and an assumption the 3x3 top left corner will be extended.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all training examples, paying close attention to how colors and shapes relate to each other within and between the input and output grids. Don't fixate on the top-left corner.\n2.  **Identify the *Real* Pattern Unit:** Determine the *actual* repeating unit, which might not be 3x3, and is likely dependent on the color.\n3.  **Precise Pattern Repetition Logic:** Figure out the exact rule governing how the pattern unit repeats. This may involve rotations, reflections, or other manipulations, in addition to simple repetition.\n4.   Document the changes in the pattern from input to output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using `code_execution` where applicable):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the observed results, along with some attempts to use code to get more precise data:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (11, 11)\n*   **Output Shape:** (11, 11)\n*   **Result:** Correct. The initial 3x3 pattern (blue, green, yellow; green, yellow, blue; yellow, blue, green) is correctly extended, with a rightward shift to the colors.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (15, 15)\n*   **Output Shape:** (15, 15)\n*   **Result:** Incorrect. The code output shows a 3x3 pattern of only two colors in an input grid of three colors. The initial 3x3 are extended. The output is an alternating two-color pattern.\n*   **Expected output analysis:** There is no 3x3 pattern of three colors in either input or output. The output alternates two colors in an intricate pattern.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input Shape:** (30, 30)\n*   **Output Shape:** (30, 30)\n*  **Result:** Partially Correct. It appears that the basic premise of extending a color-alternating, shifted pattern is on track, but the initial 3x3 pattern is wrong. The test extends this same pattern, but the extension is not correctly implemented.\n* **Expected output analysis:** Output uses the colors of the input, plus black. It extends a pattern of three colors in vertical stripes and alternates rows of the pattern.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        shape: (11, 11)\n        colors: [blue, green, yellow]\n        pattern_unit: [3x3, top-left, color-shifting]\n      output:\n        shape: (11, 11)\n        pattern_extended: True\n      result: correct\n  - example_2:\n      input:\n        shape: (15, 15)\n        colors: [red, gray, green]\n        pattern_unit: [undetermined]\n      output:\n        shape: (15, 15)\n        pattern_extended: False\n        dominant_colors: [gray, green]\n      result: incorrect\n  - example_3:\n      input:\n          shape: (30,30)\n          colors: [yellow, azure, orange]\n      output:\n          shape: (30,30)\n          colors: [yellow, azure, orange, black]\n      result: partially_correct\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised):**\n\n1.  **Identify Repeating Colors:** The output grid is constructed by identifying the colors present in the input grid.\n2.  **Create color groupings:** For each 3 x n slice of the grid (where n = width of input), note the color and repeat in the same position in the output.\n3.  **Color shift:** The next slice of the output is generated by rotating the colors in the first slice down one and placing the last color in the first position.\n4.  **Introduce Black:** Where ever there are colors that are the same above and below each other, change the cell to black (value 0)\n\nThis revised program incorporates the color shifting. It moves away from a fixed 3x3 pattern and recognizes that the size is the pattern unit, which is determined by color repetition.\n"
