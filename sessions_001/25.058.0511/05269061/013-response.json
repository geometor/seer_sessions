The rest of the grid consists of zeros. The output grid seems to be a patterned repetition of the non-zero values, without the zeros. The output keeps the original dimensions (7x7).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this example, they are 8, 3, and 4.\n2. **Establish the Repeating Unit:** The input's non-zero digits, positioned in a particular order, forms the basic repeating unit for the output.\n3. **Construct Output:** The output grid maintains the same size. Starting with the value '4', construct the first column and rows as '4 8 3'. Repeat them to form the full output matrix. It appears to depend on the relative index distance with the non-zero digits.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the non-zero values and their relative positions, and replicates that pattern, with spacing, throughout the output grid of the original size.\n"
