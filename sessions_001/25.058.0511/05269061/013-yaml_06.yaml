objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains a diagonal pattern of non-zero values.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains a repeating pattern derived from the input grid's non-zero values.
  - name: diagonal_pattern_1
    type: sequence
    elements: [8, 3]
    description: Values on the main diagonal.
  - name: diagonal_pattern_2
    type: sequence
    elements: [4]
    description: second group of values

actions:
  - name: extract_pattern
    description: Identify and extract the non-zero values and their repeating structure.
  - name: replicate_pattern
    description:  Repeat pattern across entire grid based on original position.
  - name: replace
    description: Replace all '0' with other values based on its position, related to the position of the non-zero values in the input.
relationships:
  - input_output_dimension_match: The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - pattern_replication: The output grid's pattern is derived from the non-zero elements of the input grid.
