This will become the output grid.\n2.  **Preserve:** Identify all red (2) and magenta (6) pixels in the input grid. Their positions and colors are directly copied to the output grid (which is already done in the initialization).\n3.  **Blue Fill:**\n    *   Iterate through the columns of the grid, starting from the leftmost column (index 0).\n    *   For each column, iterate through the rows from top to bottom (starting at row 0).\n    *   If a pixel is white (0), change it to blue (1).\n    *   If a pixel is red (2) or magenta(6), keep original color.\n    *   If a pixel has any *other* color (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, or 9), *stop* filling blue for the *rest* of this column.
