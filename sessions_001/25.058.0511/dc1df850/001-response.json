The input grid contains a few pixels of red (2) and magenta (6), with the rest being white (0). The output grid introduces blue (1) pixels in the top three rows, replacing some of the white pixels. The red pixels remain in the same positions, and the magenta pixel also stays the same. It seems like a flood fill operation might be occurring, starting from some white pixels and stopping when it hits a non-white pixel.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
