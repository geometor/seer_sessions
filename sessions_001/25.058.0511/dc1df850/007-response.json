The input grid appears to have isolated single-pixel objects of different colors (red, green, azure). The output grid introduces a new color (blue) in a specific pattern seemingly related to the position of the original colored pixels. It appears that the blue color expands or \"floods\" from the original non-zero pixels, but has a specific structure.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each arm of the cross will have length one, and the shape consists in the pixels that are at distance one. The center point of the cross coincides with the position of the seed.\n    *   The original seed pixel value in retained in the output grid.\n\n3. **Other Pixels**: Every other pixel that is not involved in any transformation remain the same, with value 0 (color white).\n"
