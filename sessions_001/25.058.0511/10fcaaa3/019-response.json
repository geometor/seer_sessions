The input grid is 4x4, while the output grid expands to 8x8. It seems the object is replicated downwards, and then the replications are all surrounded by the azure, creating alternating rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The number of final replicated rows containing the red pixel should be equal to the heigh of the input.\n3.  **Create frame rows:** for every replicated row, add a row above, with alternating azure and white pixels\n4. **Assemble Output Grid:** Combine the replicated object, with frame rows, and empty rows to create output with twice the input grid dimensions. Ensure that replicated rows and empty rows alternate, starting from the top. Ensure there is a frame row between each set of replications.\n\n"
