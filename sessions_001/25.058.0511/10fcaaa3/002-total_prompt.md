## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x128 at 0x7B1DDE4F89D0>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x256 at 0x7B1DDE4F8150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid. The input grid appears to be smaller and simpler than the output grid. The output grid seems to have a repeating pattern, with the original input seemingly embedded within and expanded. Specifically, the single gray (5) pixel in the input is replicated in the output, and a new color, azure (8), is introduced, creating a checkered pattern.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x4
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - colors: [white, gray]
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x8
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - colors: [white, gray, azure]
  - relation: input_embedded_in_output
    details: The input grid's gray pixel (5) is replicated multiple times in the output grid.
  - action: introduce_color
    details: A new color, azure (8), is introduced in the output.
  - pattern: checkered_pattern
    colors: [white, azure]
    details: An alternating pattern of white and azure pixels is created.
  - transformation: expansion
    details: dimensions of the grid are doubled
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** Double the height and width of the input grid.
2.  **Replicate Gray:** For every gray (5) pixel in the input, replicate its placement in the output, repeating the input grid a total of height times and length time.
3.  **Checkerboard Overlay**: Every other row alternate filling the first cell with an azure pixel, and blank.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
