## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 4 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7B1DE5F8F550>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 8 0 8
0 4 0 0 4 0
8 0 8 8 0 8
0 8 8 0 8 0
4 0 0 4 0 0
8 8 8 8 8 8
0 4 0 0 4 0
8 0 8 8 0 8
0 8 8 0 8 0
4 0 0 4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x640 at 0x7B1DDE699FD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and azure (8). The input grid appears to be smaller and simpler than the output grid. The output grid seems to expand upon the input, replicating and potentially mirroring certain elements. There's a noticeable introduction of azure (8) in the output, which is absent in the input. The yellow (4) pixels seem to maintain their relative positions but are duplicated.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, yellow]
      - dimensions: 5x3
      - yellow_positions: [(1,1), (4,0)]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, yellow, azure]
      - dimensions: 10x6
      - yellow_positions: [(1,1), (1,4), (4,0), (4,3), (7,1), (7,4), (10,0), (10,3)]
      - azure_positions:  # Too many to list individually, represents a pattern
        pattern: "fills space around yellow, and creates a mirrored border."

actions:
    - type: expansion
      description: "The input grid is expanded, roughly doubling in both dimensions."
    - type: replication
      description: "Yellow pixels are replicated, possibly mirrored or translated."
    - type: insertion
      description: "Azure pixels are introduced in a specific pattern, creating borders and filling areas around the replicated yellow pixels."
    - type: mirroring_or_translation
      description: "Yellow positions in first quadrant appear mirror in 2nd quadrant."

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Yellow pixels in the output maintain relative positions to each other within expanded quadrants, although mirrored from original grid."
  - type: size
    description: "Output grid is approximately double the size of the input grid in both dimensions."
  - type: color_addition
    description: "The output introduces azure which is not present in the input."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand the Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid (approximately). If input is *m* x *n*, output is *2m* x *2n*. If expansion leaves remainder, the added row or column is filled according to the mirrored pattern for color 8.

2.  **Replicate Yellow Pixels:** For every yellow pixel in the original grid, replicate it once within it's own quadrant. The overall effect is that the upper left corner becomes quadrants of the input.

3.  **Fill with Azure:** Fill all remaining cells with azure in mirrored border pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
