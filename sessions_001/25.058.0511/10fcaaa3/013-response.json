The primary colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and azure (8). The input grid appears to be smaller and simpler than the output grid. The output grid seems to expand upon the input, replicating and potentially mirroring certain elements. There's a noticeable introduction of azure (8) in the output, which is absent in the input. The yellow (4) pixels seem to maintain their relative positions but are duplicated.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

If expansion leaves remainder, the added row or column is filled according to the mirrored pattern for color 8.\n\n2.  **Replicate Yellow Pixels:** For every yellow pixel in the original grid, replicate it once within it's own quadrant.
