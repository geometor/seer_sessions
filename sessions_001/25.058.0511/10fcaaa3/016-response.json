            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code (which is not provided, but implied by the `analyze_results` function) clearly doesn't fully capture the transformation rule. The `analyze_results` function shows that the generated `transform` function (also not provided) does not correctly predict the output for any of the given examples. It appears the transform function has only learned from the initial pair, and not generalized to the problem. We need to revise the natural language program to accurately represent the relationship between input and output grids.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair closely. Identify the consistent changes and relationships. Pay close attention to the shapes, colors, and positions. The current output seems related, so there is something for us to build on.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Define what constitutes an \"object\" in this context. Is it individual colored pixels, or groups of pixels?\n3.  **Relationship Mapping:** Determine how objects in the input relate to objects in the output. Focus on changes in color, position, shape, and size.\n4.  **Natural Language Program Refinement:** Based on the analysis, create a step-by-step natural language program describing the transformation.\n5. **Hypothesis Generation** Create a hypothesis regarding the transformation that could unify all the examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 6)\n    *   Predicted Output Shape: (3,6)\n    *   Correct: True\n    *   Observations: The output grid is twice as wide as the input. Yellow (4) pixels remain yellow. All 0's become 8's.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 8)\n    *   Predicted Output Shape: (4,8)\n    *   Correct: True\n    *   Observations: The output grid is twice as wide as the input. Yellow (4) pixels remain yellow. All 0's become 8's.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 10)\n    *   Predicted Output Shape: (5,10)\n    *    Correct: True\n    *   Observations: Output is again twice as wide. Yellow (4) pixels remain yellow, 0's become 8's.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object_type: pixel\n    properties:\n      - color:\n        - values: [0, 4]\n        - change:\n          - 0: 8\n          - 4: 4\n  - transformation_type: expansion\n    properties:\n      - width:\n        - factor: 2\n        - operation: multiplication\n      - height:\n        - factor: 1\n        - operation: multiplication\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Grid Expansion:** The width of the output grid is double the width of the input grid. The height remains the same.\n2.  **Color Transformation:**\n    *   If a pixel in the input grid is color 0 (white), it becomes color 8 (azure) in the output grid.\n    *   If a pixel in the input grid is color 4 (yellow), it remains color 4 (yellow) in the output grid.\n3. **Pixel duplication:** Each original pixel in the expanded grid now takes up two spots.\n\n**Hypothesis**\n\nThe core transformation rule involves expanding the width of the grid by a factor of two while keeping the height constant. During this horizontal expansion, white(0) pixels are transformed to azure(8), and all other pixels maintain their color. All pixels get duplicated and moved to the right one cell, and the previous location is filled with an 8.\n"
