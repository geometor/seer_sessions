## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DDE7AB850>

**output:**
```
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DDE909950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid (matrix) of single-digit integers.  The integers represent colors. The input grid appears to be transformed into another 3x3 grid. The core operation seems to be a change in the color of specific cells based on their original color and possibly their position.  Specifically, the blue (1) cells in the input become white (0) cells in the output, and the white (0) center cell remains white (0).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
  - observation: Cell values are integers representing colors.
  - observation: Input grid contains values 0 and 1.
  - observation: Output grid contains values 0 and 1.
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: [0, 1]
  - object: Cell
    properties:
        - color: integer (0 or 1)
        - position: (row, column)
  - action: ColorChange
    description: "Change color of cell from 1 to 0"
    precondition: "Cell value is 1"
    postcondition: "Cell value is 0"
  - relationship: InputGrid_to_OutputGrid
    transformation: ColorChange (described above)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **If** the cell's value is 1 (blue), change its value to 0 (white).
3.  **Otherwise** if the cell's values is 0 (white) keep its value as 0 (white).
4.  The resulting grid is the output.

In simpler terms: Replace all blue cells with white cells, leave white cells as it is.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
