## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0
4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x7B1DDE90AFD0>

**output:**
```
6 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 4 0
6 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 6
0 4 0 6 0 4 0 4 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x7B1DE5E22750>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are yellow (4) and white (0) in the input. The output introduces a new color, magenta (6), while retaining some of the yellow and white pixels from the input. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x10). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of yellow pixels with magenta, particularly at the corners and edges of contiguous yellow blocks.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x10
      elements: pixels
      colors: [yellow, white, magenta]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        input: [yellow, white]
        output: [yellow, white, magenta]
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    properties:
      from: yellow
      to: magenta
    conditions:
      - "corners of yellow blocks"
      - "edges of yellow blocks"

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically."
  - type: containment
    description: "Grid contains pixels."
  - type: grouping
    description: "Yellow pixels form contiguous blocks."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous blocks of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each yellow block**:
    *   If a yellow pixel is on a corner of a block replace the yellow pixel with a magenta (6) pixel. Corners are left and right ends of a horizontal block.
    *    If a yellow pixel borders a white pixel on any edge on the left or right, replace that yellow pixel with a magenta (6).
3.  **Retain** all white (0) pixels in their original positions.
4.  **Output** the modified grid.

Essentially, the transformation replaces specific yellow pixels with magenta based on their position relative to other yellow pixels and white pixels, focusing on edges, and left and right ends of contiguous blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
