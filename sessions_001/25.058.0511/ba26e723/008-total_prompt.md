## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0
4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x7B1DE5E23C50>

**output:**
```
0 4 0 6 0 4 0 4 0 6 0
6 4 4 6 4 4 6 4 4 6 4
6 0 4 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11). The primary colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The transformation seems to involve selective replacement of pixels. Specifically, some yellow (4) pixels are becoming magenta (6)

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output grids are 3x11.
  - type: colors
    description: Input grid contains colors 0 (white) and 4 (yellow).
  - type: colors
    description: Output grid contains colors 0 (white), 4 (yellow), and 6 (magenta).
  - type: transformation
    description: Some yellow pixels are replaced with magenta pixels.
  - type: pattern
    description: The replacement pattern appears to have a horizontal and vertical pattern.
  - type: row_observation
    description: in row 0, color 4 at index 3 and 9 are turned to color 6
  - type: row_observation
    description: in row 1, color 4 at index 0,3,6, and 9 are turned to color 6
  - type: row_observation
    description: in row 2, color 4 at index 0, 6 are turned to color 6
  - type: object
    description: groups of same color pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** Color: If the cell's color is white (0), it remains unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Check Color**: If cell is color yellow (4).
    a. Check Location. Change yellow (4) to magenta (6) if the cell is at
       row 0 and the horizontal index of the cell, counting the first index as 0, are the numbers 3 or 9.
    b. Check Location. Change yellow (4) to magenta (6) if the cell is at
       row 1 and the horizontal index of the cell, counting the first index as 0, are the numbers 0, 3, 6, or 9.
    c. Check Location. Change yellow (4) to magenta (6) if the cell is at
       row 2 and the horizontal index of the cell, counting the first index as 0, are the numbers 0, or 6.
4. **Else**, all other color yellow(4) remain unchanged.
5. Copy all other values directly

Another way, that makes sense is that, there is a pattern of replacements
across the columns, at offsets 0, 3, 6, and 9, starting at column 0.
And a pattern of replacement across rows, starting at row 1 and cycling
downwards and back to top at row 2.

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** Color: If the cell's color is white (0), it remains unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Check** Column for offset in \[0, 3, 6, 9]. If not, no change
4. **Check** the Row index + 1 (starting at one at row 0). Find the remainder
   after division by 3.
    If this is 2, then change the color yellow to magenta.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
