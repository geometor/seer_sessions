The primary colors observed are yellow (4) and white (0) in the input. The output introduces a new color, magenta (6), while retaining some of the yellow and white pixels from the input. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x10). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of yellow pixels with magenta, particularly at the corners and edges of contiguous yellow blocks.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
