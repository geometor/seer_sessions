The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11). The primary colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The transformation seems to involve selective replacement of pixels. Specifically, some yellow (4) pixels are becoming magenta (6)\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
