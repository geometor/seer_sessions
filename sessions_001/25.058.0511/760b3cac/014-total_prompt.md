## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7B1DDE6E0C50>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8) and yellow (4), with the background being white (0). The shapes formed by the colors appear to be significant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 6
      columns: 9
      elements: integers (0-9)
      background_color: 0 (white)

  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 8 (azure)
      initial_position:
        row: 0
        column: 3
      description: "A vertical line of length 1, followed by a horizontal line of length 2 one row below"

  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 4 (yellow)
      initial_position:
          row: 3
          column: 3
      description: "A vertical line of length 1, followed by a horizontal line of length 3 one row below."

actions:
  - type: move
    object: azure shape
    description: >
      The azure shape is duplicated and moved.  The original vertical azure
      pixel is extended one cell to the left and one to the right and
      duplicated in those positions and the two new azure pixels are moved
      up one row.  The horizontal azure pixels are replicated, with no
      changes.

  - type: maintain
    object: yellow shape
    description: " The yellow shape is maintained with no changes"

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: The shapes do not overlap and have distinct positions on the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate the azure (8) and yellow (4) shapes within the input grid. The azure shape consists of a single vertical element and connected horizontal element, the yellow a single vertical element connected to a horizontal element.

2. **Yellow shape**: maintain this shape, no changes
    
3.  **Azure Shape Transformation:**
    *   The vertical part of the original azure shape is duplicated and moved.
    *   In the input, locate the azure pixel that represents the vertical element of the shape.
    *   Extend that azure pixel, one to the left and one to the right.
    *   Duplicate the new azure pixels one row above.
    *   Copy all pixels representing the horizontal part of the azure shape with no change.

4.  **Output Grid Construction:** Create the output grid by placing the transformed azure shape and the original, unchanged, yellow shape onto a white (0) background.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
