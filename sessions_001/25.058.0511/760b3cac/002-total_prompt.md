## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7B1DDE6E0C50>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 8 0 8 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, broken down into perceptions, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program.

**Perceptions:**

*   The input and output grids are the same dimensions (6x9).
*   The colors present are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).
*   The yellow (4) shape remains unchanged in position and configuration.
*   The azure (8) pixels in the input seem to be "moving" or "filling" to the left.
*    It looks like only the azure pixels on the first row is moving.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - movable: true
      - initial_positions: [[0, 3], [0, 5], [1, 4], [1,5], [2, 4]]
      - final_positions:  [[0, 0], [0,2], [0, 3], [1, 0], [1,1], [1,4],[1,5], [2,0],[2,6]]
    actions:
      - name: shift_left
        details: Move to the leftmost available position in the row.
  - object: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow (4)
    properties:
      - movable: false
      - initial_positions: [[3, 3], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
      - final_positions: [[3, 3], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
    actions: []
  - grid:
      dimensions: [6, 9]
      background: white (0)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all azure (8) pixels and yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Immobile Object:** The yellow (4) object remains unchanged.
3.  **Mobile objects:** The azure (8) pixels are mobile.
4.  **Transformation rule:**
    1.  The azure(8) color fills or moves to the leftmost position of its own row, as far as available, without wrapping to other rows.
    2.  If there is remaining azure after a row is filled, they are put in the leftmost available spot.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
