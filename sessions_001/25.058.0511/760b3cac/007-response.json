Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of azure and yellow pixels. The transformation seems to focus on the azure (8) pixels, specifically how they are arranged relative to their initial configuration and each other.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
