Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of azure and yellow pixels. The transformation seems to focus on the azure (8) pixels, specifically how they are arranged relative to their initial configuration and each other.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output grids of integers.
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: azure
        value: 8
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
  - object: azure_shape_1
    color: azure
    initial_position: row 1, column 4
    shape: "L" like configuration ( can be a result of merging of smaller shapes)
    notes: composed of original separate azure color shapes
  - object: azure_shape_2
     color: azure
     initial_position: row 1, column 6
     shape: a single pixel
  - object: azure_shape_3
     color: azure
     initial_position: row 1, column 7
     shape: a single pixel
  - object: yellow_shape
    color: yellow
    position: row 4, column 6
    shape:  "L" shaped
  - action: azure_expansion
    description: The azure shape expands horizontally.
    details: >
      Expansion of the Azure shape specifically to the right side,
      filling adjacent white cells to the right.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels and the yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Azure Expansion**: For the azure shape, expand any pixel with value 8 to the right, replacing any white neighbor with azure.
3. **Yellow Shape** The yellow object remains unchanged.
4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid reflecting these changes.
