"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all azure (8) pixels and yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Immobile Object:** The yellow (4) object remains unchanged.
3.  **Mobile objects:** The azure (8) pixels are mobile.
4.  **Transformation rule:**
    1.  The azure(8) color fills or moves to the leftmost position of its own row, as far as available, without wrapping to other rows.
    2.  If there is remaining azure after a row is filled, they are put in the leftmost available spot.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved moving azure (8) pixels to the left within their rows. The results on the full training set reveal that this rule is too specific and doesn't fully capture the general transformation. Specifically, the handling of "remaining azure" pixels is not correct across all examples. The current strategy of placing them in the first available spot from the top isn't the general rule. It appears there must be some combination of placing the objects next to other objects, which we have mis-identified.

My strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each training example. Pay close attention to cases where the actual output differs from the expected output.
2.  **Identify the Core Rule:** Determine the precise rule governing the movement/placement of the azure pixels, especially in scenarios where they cannot all fit within their original rows. Consider object interaction and adjacency.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately and completely describe the observed transformation.
4. **Document Facts:** Create a well-documented list of facts that specify the objects, their interactions, and any movements or rules.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get accurate metrics, I need to see the shapes of the grids and pixel counts. I'll execute the code on each to get this.

```python
import numpy as np

def find_pixels(grid, color):
    return np.argwhere(grid == color)

def analyze_example(example):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    actual_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
    
    input_azure_count = len(find_pixels(input_grid, 8))
    input_yellow_count = len(find_pixels(input_grid, 4))
    expected_azure_count = len(find_pixels(expected_output_grid, 8))
    expected_yellow_count = len(find_pixels(expected_output_grid, 4))
    actual_azure_count = len(find_pixels(actual_output_grid, 8))
    actual_yellow_count = len(find_pixels(actual_output_grid, 4))

    print(f"  Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"  Expected Output shape: {expected_output_grid.shape}")
    print(f"  Actual Output shape: {actual_output_grid.shape}")
    print(f"  Input Azure: {input_azure_count}, Yellow: {input_yellow_count}")
    print(f"  Expected Azure: {expected_azure_count}, Yellow: {expected_yellow_count}")
    print(f"  Actual Azure: {actual_azure_count}, Yellow: {actual_yellow_count}")
    print(f"  Correct: {np.array_equal(expected_output_grid, actual_output_grid)}")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
    count: variable
    behavior: mobile
    movement:
      - fills_row_left: True
      - fills_available: False
      - respects_yellow: True

  - color: yellow (4)
    count: variable
    behavior: immobile
    movement: []

rules:
  - azure_placement: "Azure pixels move to the leftmost available position in their row.  If a yellow object blocks movement in that row, azure moves as far left as possible. Azure pixels do not move to available positions in rows, they stack.  If azure is present in multiple rows, the filled azure pixels will occupy the same row position as the source azure."
  - yellow_placement: "Yellow pixels remain in their original positions."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Immobile Object:** Yellow (4) pixels do not change their positions. They act as obstacles.
3.  **Mobile Objects:** Azure (8) pixels are mobile.
4. **Transformation:**
    *   Azure (8) pixels move to the leftmost available position within their *own* row.
    *   Yellow (4) pixels block the movement of azure (8) pixels *within a row*.
    *   Azure pixels fill empty spaces to the left within the row, before yellow.
    *  Azure objects stack on the left, occupying the same row as the source row.
    

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
