## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 5 0 0 6 0 0 0 0
2 5 5 7 0 0 6 0 1
0 3 0 0 0 1 9 4 0
0 7 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
0 9 0 0 0 1 0 0 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 4
0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7B1DDE7AB850>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
6 0 1
9 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DDE42D150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation from a larger grid (9x9) to a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of it. The output grid only includes non-white color from the third row, that is, it is not a simple sub-region selection. It appears that some selection or filtering criteria are applied based on position and possibly color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: output_grid_values_are_subset_of_input_grid_values
  - observation: output grid is taking colors from the third row of the input grid.
  - observation: all colors except white in the third row.
  - relationship: output_grid_derived_from_input_grid
  - operation: filtering, selection, or extraction based on the color of the third row only.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus on Row:** Identify the third row within the input grid.
2.  **Filter Colors:** Within that third row, disregard any white color (represented by 0).
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Populate it with the non-white colored from the third row of the input grid, from left to right. Maintain the relative ordering of the colors as they appear in the input row, and preserve the color values (numbers).
4. **All other values**: are 0 (white)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
