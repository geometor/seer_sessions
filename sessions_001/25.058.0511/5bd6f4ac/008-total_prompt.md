## Example 2

**input:**
```
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0
0 4 0 7 0 5 0 8 1
0 2 0 0 7 1 4 4 5
0 6 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
8 3 0 4 2 0 0 9 7
0 0 2 3 0 2 0 6 7
4 0 4 0 3 4 7 0 7
7 1 0 0 0 0 3 0 0
3 2 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7B1DDE7AB850>

**output:**
```
0 6 0
0 8 1
4 4 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5E22750>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (9x9) of colored pixels into a smaller grid (3x3) of colored pixels. The colors are represented by digits 0-9. The input grid seems to have a lot of '0' (white) pixels, suggesting a sparse matrix. The output grid is much smaller and appears to contain a selection of non-zero pixels from the input grid, but not all. It does preserve the arrangement. It appears to be the lower right 3x3 corner.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid is 9x9, output grid is 3x3.
    dimensions: [9, 9]
    output_dimensions: [3, 3]
  - type: pixels
    description: Each cell in the grid is a pixel represented by a digit 0-9.
    values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  - type: selection
    description: The output grid appears to select a subset of non zero pixels, maintaining their input arrangement.
  - type: location
    description: selection is the lower right hand corner
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the sub-grid:** Focus on the bottom-right 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid.
2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Create the output grid by copying the colors from the 3x3 sub-grid.
3.  All the values and their relative 2d positions from the bottom right 3x3 sub grid are maintained.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
