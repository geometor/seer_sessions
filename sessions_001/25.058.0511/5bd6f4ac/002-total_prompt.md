## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 0 0 7 0 0 9 7 0
8 4 0 6 6 0 4 8 4
1 7 0 0 0 0 4 0 0
1 1 0 9 1 0 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0
8 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 0
0 7 0 9 9 2 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 2 4 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7B1DDE6A1DD0>

**output:**
```
9 7 0
4 8 4
4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5E206D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares (pixels), where each color represents a digit from 0-9. The input is a larger grid, and the output is a smaller grid. The transformation appears to involve selecting a specific region of the input grid. The output grid seems to consist of some non-white and non-black colored pixels from the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9 (input), 3x3 (output)
      - elements: pixels
      - colors: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
    relationships:
      - input_contains: output_region

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: A 3x3 subgrid is selected from the input grid.
    parameters:
        selection_criteria: "The upper left corner appears to be the first non-zero and non-black pixel encountered when scanning by rows, then finding the next 3 x 3 subgrid"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Scan the input grid row by row, from top to bottom and left to right.
2.  **Find Top-Left Corner:** Look for a pixel in the original image that is not white (0) and not black. Mark its coordinates.
3. **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the 3x3 subgrid. The top left corner will be the marked pixel from the original image.
4.  **Output:** The output is the extracted 3x3 subgrid.

Essentially, the transformation extracts a 3x3 sub-grid based on finding a non-zero, non-black cell from the input, scanning by rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
