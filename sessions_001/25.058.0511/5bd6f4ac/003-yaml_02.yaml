facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is extracted from the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The extraction starts from a "pivot" pixel.
  - observation: |
      The pivot pixel seems the first non-white (non-zero) pixel found in the input grid by scanning row by row and column by column.
  - observation: |
      The output grid's content and arrangement are derived relative to this pivot pixel.
  - observation: |
      The output 3x3 grid contains non-zero pixel values arranged vertically and diagonally, maintaining their original relative positions.
  - observation: |
     The extracted grid always have non-zero pixel values arranged with
     one in the top right corner, one in the bottom left corner,
     and all other positions are zero.
