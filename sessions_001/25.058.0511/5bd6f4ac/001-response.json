The input is a larger grid, and the output is a smaller grid. The transformation appears to involve selecting a specific region of the input grid. The output grid seems to consist of some non-white and non-black colored pixels from the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Mark its coordinates.\n3. **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the 3x3 subgrid.
