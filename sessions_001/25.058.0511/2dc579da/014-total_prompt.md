## Example 3

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x704 at 0x7B1DDE5EF350>

**output:**
```
3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3
3 8 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3
3 3 3 3 3
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is larger and contains a vertical and horizontal line of blue (1) pixels intersecting at the center. The output grid is a smaller subsection of the input grid, specifically the top-left quadrant defined by the intersection of the blue lines, excluding the blue lines themselves. There's also a single azure (8) pixel in both input and output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: 11x11
        output: 5x5
      colors:
        - value: 3
          name: green
        - value: 1
          name: blue
        - value: 8
          name: azure
    features:
      - description: blue lines
        properties:
           orientation: vertical and horizontal
           intersection: center
      - description: azure pixel
        properties:
          location:
            input: row 2, column 1
            output: row 2, column 1 relative to output grid

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Extract a subgrid from the input.
    parameters:
       bounds: Defined by blue lines intersection

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: output grid is a subset of the input grid, specifically the top-left quadrant before the blue lines.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Lines:** Locate the vertical and horizontal lines composed of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Find Intersection:** Determine the point where these blue lines intersect.
3. **Define Quadrant:** The intersection divides the grid into 4 quadrants conceptually, select top-left quadrant.
4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid by extracting all pixels from the original grid that fall within the top-left quadrant, *excluding* the pixels that form the intersecting blue lines.
5. **Preserve colors**: maintain all original colors.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
