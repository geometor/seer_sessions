The results indicate this approach is partially correct but needs adjustments. The core issue seems to be that the starting point of the 2x2 grid and potentially the object we are focusing on has to be refined and should maybe not consider the color azure (8) at all.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the location and values of pixels in the input versus the output.\n2.  **Identify Key Objects:** Determine which object in the input is being transformed and extract that object in full.\n3.  **Refine Starting Point Logic:** Re-evaluate the criteria for selecting the starting point of the extraction. It may not always be the bottom-left non-8 pixel. Look at the color and position.\n4.  **Consider Size and Shape:** While many outputs are 2x2, explore if any input grids have the feature in other shapes or sizes, or if those shapes or sizes are important to the rule.\n5. **Document the Process:** Write a clear description of the observed transformation rule to produce a clear program in plain language.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations**\n\nI'll use `code_execution` to gather grid sizes and output content to provide an organized view of each.\nI will inspect to see if the output contents exists as a perfect subset of the input grid.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_example(example):\n    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])\n    input_shape = input_grid.shape\n    output_shape = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Check if the output grid is a direct subgrid of the input\n    is_subgrid = False\n    for i in range(input_shape[0] - output_shape[0] + 1):\n        for j in range(input_shape[1] - output_shape[1] + 1):\n            if np.array_equal(input_grid[i:i+output_shape[0], j:j+output_shape[1]], output_grid):\n                is_subgrid = True\n                break\n        if is_subgrid:\n            break\n\n    print(f\"\"\"\nInput Shape: {input_shape}\nOutput Shape: {output_shape}\nOutput Content:\n{output_grid}\nIs output a direct subgrid of input: {is_subgrid}\n\"\"\")\n\ntask = data['train']\nfor i, example in enumerate(task):\n    print(f\"--- Example {i+1} ---\")\n    analyze_example(example)\n\n```"
