## Example 2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
4 4 4 2 4 1 4
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2 2 2
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7B1DDE5EF350>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 1 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5F8DF50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The primary colors involved are yellow (4), red (2), and blue (1). The input grid appears to contain a cross-shaped pattern of red pixels, surrounded by yellow pixels. A single blue pixel is embedded within the yellow, near the cross. The output grid seems to be a zoomed-in or cropped version of the input, focused on the area around the blue pixel, discarding other parts.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [yellow, red, blue]
      pattern: red cross
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [yellow, blue]
      size: smaller than input_grid
  - object: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color: blue
      location: center of output_grid
  - action: crop
    agent: system
    target: input_grid
    result: output_grid
    parameters:
      center: blue_pixel
  - relationship:
    subject: output_grid
    predicate: is_centered_on
    object: blue_pixel

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the blue pixel:** Locate the single blue (value 1) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Define the crop region:** Determine a 3x3 grid centered on the coordinates of the identified blue pixel.
3.  **Extract the crop:** Create the output grid by extracting the 3x3 region from the input grid, using the blue pixel's location as the center.

Essentially, the transformation crops the input grid to a 3x3 area centered on the blue pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
