Okay, let's analyze the results of the `analyze_example` function on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identifies the horizontal and vertical blue lines that divide the input grid into quadrants. It also attempts to determine which quadrant is reflected in the output. However, the initial quadrant detection logic is incomplete and needs to be refined based on all the training examples. The existing logic has some correct components but is also making assumptions and needs work to make it generic.

The core strategy is to:

1.  **Verify Blue Line Detection:** Ensure the code accurately identifies the row of the horizontal blue line and the column of the vertical blue line in all examples.
2.  **Improve Quadrant Logic:** Analyze the relationship between input and output shapes and the blue line positions to correctly identify the selected quadrant. We will focus on identifying the rule that transforms input to output.
3.  **Solidify Action Description:** Refine the natural language program to accurately describe the selection and mirroring/copying process.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

Let's run the provided code on the training examples and gather the results. I'll use the provided `pretty_print_analysis` function.

```python
# Assuming 'task' is defined elsewhere and contains the training examples
# Example usage (replace with your actual task data)

task = {
    "train": [
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
        },
        {
            "input": [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
            "output": [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
        }
    ]
}

results = pretty_print_analysis(task['train'])
for i, r in enumerate(results):
  print(f"Example {i+1}:")
  for k,v in r.items():
    print(f"  {k}: {v}")
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Blue Lines:** Find the horizontal and vertical lines within the input grid that are composed entirely of blue (1) pixels. These lines intersect, dividing the grid into four quadrants.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** note the dimensions (height, width) of the output grid.
3.  **Select Quadrant:** The output grid always corresponds to one of the four quadrants in the input grid, defined by the blue lines. The selected quadrant in the input grid is the one that has the same dimensions as the output grid.
4.  **Copy Quadrant:** Copy the contents of the *selected quadrant* from the input grid to the output grid.

The key refinement here is the explicit statement that the *selected quadrant* dimensions must match the *output* dimensions. The previous program began this description, but relied too heavily on assumptions based on the first example.
