## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 8 3 8 8
8 8 3 8 8
3 3 3 3 3
8 8 3 8 8
4 8 3 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7B1DDE909950>

**output:**
```
8 8
4 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7B1DE5F8D050>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to contain a larger, more complex pattern, while the output grid seems to be a simplified or extracted version of the input. The colors present are primarily azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4). The most notable change is the removal of the green (3) pixels and some of the azure (8) pixels, resulting in a smaller grid containing only the yellow (4) and some surrounding azure(8). It appears the transformation is extracting the bottom left corner where the color changes from 8 to a color other than 8.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      elements: pixels
      colors: [azure, green, yellow]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: extract_corner
    description: Isolates a subgrid based on color change.
    parameters:
      corner: bottom-left

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically.
  - type: color_change
    description: The transition point where the color changes from azure to other.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Corner:** Focus on the bottom-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Locate Color change:** Find any pixel where the value is not 8.
3. **Extract Subgrid:** Create an output grid consisting the non-8 pixel and to its right.
4.  **extend up and right:** add the pixels above and to the right of existing pixels until edge of grid or non-8 pixel is reached.

In essence, the program extracts a 2x2 subgrid containing any non-8 pixel and the 8 pixels above and to the right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
