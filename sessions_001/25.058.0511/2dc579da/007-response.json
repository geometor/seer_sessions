The primary colors involved are yellow (4), red (2), and blue (1). The input grid appears to contain a cross-shaped pattern of red pixels, surrounded by yellow pixels. A single blue pixel is embedded within the yellow, near the cross. The output grid seems to be a zoomed-in or cropped version of the input, focused on the area around the blue pixel, discarding other parts.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
