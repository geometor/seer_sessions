The input grid contains multiple colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color), specifically red (2), green (3), and blue (1) objects, against a white (0) background. The output grid seems to contain only the red (2) object, reshaped and repositioned. The green and blue objects from the input are absent in the output. The output's dimensions are smaller than the input's. The overall transformation focuses on a single color, seemingly extracting and simplifying a specific shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
