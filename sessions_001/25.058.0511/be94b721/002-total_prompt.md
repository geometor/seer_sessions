## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=832x448 at 0x7B1DDE7AB850>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 0
0 2 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x7B1DE5E21C50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another, smaller grid. The input grid contains multiple colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color), specifically red (2), green (3), and blue (1) objects, against a white (0) background. The output grid seems to contain only the red (2) object, reshaped and repositioned. The green and blue objects from the input are absent in the output. The output's dimensions are smaller than the input's. The overall transformation focuses on a single color, seemingly extracting and simplifying a specific shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_object
    color: red
    input_shape: irregular
    output_shape: rectangle
    action: extracted_and_simplified
  - id: green_object
    color: green
    input_shape: L-shape
    output_shape: null
    action: removed
  - id: blue_object
    color: blue
    input_shape: L-shape
    output_shape: null
    action: removed
  - id: background
    color: white
    input_shape: grid
    output_shape: smaller_grid
    action: cropped

relationships:
  - subject: red_object
    relation: present_in
    object: input_and_output
  - subject: green_object
    relation: present_in
    object: input_only
  - subject: blue_object
    relation: present_in
    object: input_only
  - subject: output
    relation: contains
    object: red_object_simplified
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color in the input grid. These are our objects. Specifically, find the red (value 2) object.
2.  **Filter by Color:** Discard all objects that are not red.
3. **Simplify and Extract red object**: extract the red object.
4. **Create Output:** Construct a new grid containing *only* the reshaped and cropped minimal boundary of the red object. All other colors/objects are ignored.

In essence, the transformation isolates, and extracts the red object into a concise format.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
