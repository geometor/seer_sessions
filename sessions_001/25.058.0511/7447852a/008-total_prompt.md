## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=960x192 at 0x7B1DDE7AB850>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0
4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0
4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=960x192 at 0x7B1DDE69B6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are red (2) and white (0) in the input, with the addition of yellow (4) in the output. The grid dimensions remain constant between input and output. The transformation appears to involve a pattern related to the positioning of red pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid consists of red (2) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels in addition to red and white.
  - observation: |
      The grid dimensions (height and width) are preserved in the transformation.
  - relationship: |
      Yellow pixels in the output appear in proximity to red pixels in the input.
  - pattern: |
      The placement of red pixels creates a checkerboard on a diagonal with a step of 2 cells
      within each row and column of the input grid. Yellow replaces some white pixels on the row
      above and to the left of the white cells bounded by red and the top and left of the image, and to the bottom, and
      right of the white pixels.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, white]
      dimensions: [3x15]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, white, yellow]
      dimensions: [3x15]
  - action: color_replacement
    description: White pixels are replaced by yellow pixels based on proximity to red pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Checker board:** The red pixels for a checkerboard with steps of size 2.
3. **Conditional Yellow Placement, Row Rule:** For each row, iterate from left to right:. If the top left cell is white, and the right neighbor is white and the diagonally down-right cell is red then replace the white pixel with a yellow (4) pixel.
4. **Conditional Yellow Placement, Column Rule:** For each column iterate from top to bottom. If a cell is white, and the diagonally down and right is red, change it to yellow (4)
5. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (red and remaining white) retain their original colors.

In essence, the transformation identifies certain white pixels that, relative to a detected red cell, are up and to the left, and down and to the right, changing to yellow.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
