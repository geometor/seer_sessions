Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the results of the previously generated `transform` function (which isn't included, but it's metrics are). The core issue is to refine the initial hypothesis (whatever the `transform` function currently does) based on a broader set of examples. The provided `analyze_transformation` function helps quantify the discrepancies.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy (embodied in the unseen `transform` function) seems to have focused on changing *some* red pixels to yellow, but it's clearly not capturing the complete rule. The metrics across the examples reveal inconsistencies: some red pixels are correctly changed to yellow, some are incorrectly changed, and some are missed.  The strategy needs to shift from simply changing *some* reds to *selectively* changing reds based on a clear, consistent rule we discern from the input-output pairs.

The strategy will be:

1. **Detailed Observation:** Examine each input-output pair carefully, noting the precise positions and arrangements of red and yellow pixels.
2. **Hypothesis Refinement:**  Adjust the initial hypothesis (that red changes to yellow) to a more specific rule that explains *which* red pixels change. Consider spatial relationships, adjacency, and object properties.
3. **Metrics-Driven Validation:** Use the provided `analyze_transformation` function and results to quantitatively assess how well the refined hypothesis explains the data. Look for patterns in the `correct_change`, `incorrect_change`, and `missed_changes` metrics.
4. **Iterative Improvement:**  Repeat steps 2 and 3, iteratively refining the hypothesis until it accurately predicts the transformations in all examples.
5. **Document as YAML and Natural Language:** Expressing the rule both in the precise, structured format to help the coder as well as a human-readable description.

**Metrics and Observations (using previous results)**
I'll recreate the analysis and results to create a structured observation.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `total_red_input`: 9
    *   `total_red_output`: 3
    *    `transformed`: 6
    *   `correct_change`: unknown
    *   `incorrect_change`: unknown
    *   `missed_changes`: unknown
    *   **Observation:** Six red pixels are turned to yellow. The transformed pixels appear to be at either end of the horizontal line of red, alternating.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   `total_red_input`: 8
    *   `total_red_output`: 4
    *   `transformed`: 4
    *   `correct_change`: unknown
    *   `incorrect_change`: unknown
    *   `missed_changes`: unknown
    *   **Observation:** Four red pixels are transformed to yellow. Similar to Example 1, the transformed pixels are at the ends of the horizontal lines of red, alternating..

*   **Example 3:**
    *    `total_red_input`: 5
    *   `total_red_output`: 5
    *   `transformed`: 0
    *   `correct_change`: unknown
    *   `incorrect_change`: unknown
    *   `missed_changes`: unknown

    *   **Observation:** No transformation occurs. Notice that the red pixels do not form a single connected shape in the same way as 1 and 2.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   `total_red_input`: 9
    *   `total_red_output`: 3
    *   `transformed`: 6
    *   `correct_change`: unknown
    *   `incorrect_change`: unknown
    *   `missed_changes`: unknown
    *   **Observation:** Again, six red pixels are transformed to yellow, and three remain red. The top-left and bottom-right red pixels change, plus the final two red pixels in the diagonal.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: red_shape
    description: Contiguous blocks of red pixels.
    properties:
      - connected:  # Adjacency matters
          type: boolean
          value: true/false
      - shape_type:
          type: string
          value: line/other # categorize by shape type - "line" seems significant
    actions:
      - transform:
          condition: connected == true and shape_type == line
          from_color: red
          to_color: yellow
          rule: >
            If the red shape is a "line" (horizontally or diagonally connected),
            change the red pixels at the start/end of the line to yellow in an alternating pattern.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Shapes:** Find all contiguous blocks of red pixels. Consider them as separate objects.
2.  **Connectivity Check:** Determine if a red shape is "connected" – meaning the red pixels are adjacent horizontally or diagonally.
3.  **Shape Type Check** determine if the shape is a "line". A line is defined as a series of horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent pixels of the same color.
4.  **Conditional Transformation:** If a red shape is a connected line:
    *   Change the first red pixel in the line to yellow.
    *   Skip the next red pixel (leave it red).
    *   Change the next red pixel to yellow, and so on, in an alternating pattern from both ends, towards the center of the line.
5.  **Other Shapes:** If the red shape is *not* a connected line, do not perform any transformations. Leave the pixels as they are.

The critical refinement is the introduction of the "connected line" concept and the alternating transformation rule. This explains why Example 3 has no changes (not a single connected shape) and clarifies the changes in Examples 1, 2, and 4.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
