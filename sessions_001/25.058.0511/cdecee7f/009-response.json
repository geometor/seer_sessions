            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved selecting non-zero pixels, sorting them by row, and arranging them in a 3x3 grid. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this approach is too simplistic. Specifically, the arrangement must take into account not all the relative spatial positions, but just the _order_ of rows and the _order_ of columns. There is no concept of \"distance\" between rows or columns in the output. The code correctly handles multiple pixels in each row, but it's the overall strategy of fitting objects of certain criteria into a 3 x 3 that must be applied in every case.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Maintain Selection and Ordering:** The core ideas of selecting non-zero pixels and ordering them by row are valid and should be preserved.\n2.  **Refine Arrangement:** The arrangement logic needs to be adjusted. It should order by row and then by column, putting up to 3 pixels into each row.\n3. **YAML and NL Program Update:** The YAML facts and the natural language program need to reflect the updated arrangement logic.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis:**\nI will focus on the results of the transform vs expected.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input (6x5), Output (3x3). The initial program worked correctly.\n*   **Example 2:** Input (5x5), Output (3x3). The transformation filled the 3 x 3 correctly.\n*  **Example 3:** Input(9 x 8) output (3 x 3). The transformation filled the 3 x 3 correctly.\n*   **Example 4:** Input (5x5), Output (3x3). The transformation filled the 3 x 3 correctly.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 9f272b44\nobjects:\n  - type: grid\n    properties:\n      - contains_pixels: true\n      - can_be_transformed: true\n  - type: pixel\n    properties:\n      - color: integer (0-9)\n      - position: (row, column)\n\ntransformations:\n  - select: non-zero pixels\n  - order:\n      - by: row index (ascending)\n      - then_by: column index (ascending)\n  - arrange:\n      - into: 3x3 grid\n      - fill_method:\n        - row_by_row: true\n        - max_pixels_per_row: 3\n        - max_pixels_per_col: 3\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Selection:** Identify all non-zero (non-white) pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **Ordering:** Sort the selected pixels first by their row index in ascending order, and then by their column index, also in ascending order.\n3.  **Arrangement:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Populate this grid row by row. For each row in the output grid, select up to the first three pixels from the ordered list of pixels. Place each pixel into the output row, moving from left to right (increasing column index). Once a row is full (3 pixels) or no more pixels are available from this original row index, move to the next row in the output grid. Repeat until the output grid is full (3x3) or there are no more selected pixels to place.\n\n"
