Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid with single-digit numbers (0-9) representing different colors. Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), with a few colored pixels scattered throughout. The output is a 3x3 grid containing only the non-zero colored pixels from the input, preserving their original colors (represented by their numerical values). The spatial arrangement of the colored pixels appears to change significantly between the input and output. The task involves extracting and rearranging specific elements, discarding the majority.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10, 10] # Input grid dimensions
      elements: pixels
      element_type: integer # Values 0-9
      element_meaning: color_code
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3] # Output grid dimensions
      elements: pixels
      element_type: integer
      element_meaning: color_code
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: integer # 0-9
      color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      location: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Identify and select all non-zero pixels from the input grid.
  - name: rearrange
    description: Position the extracted pixels into a 3x3 grid.
  - name: discard
    description: Remove all zero-value pixels.

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains all pixels, including zero and non-zero values.
  - output_grid: Contains only the extracted non-zero pixels in a new arrangement.
  - pixel_value: Determines the color of the pixel.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify:** Scan the input 10x10 grid and identify all pixels with non-zero values (colors other than white).
2. **Extract:**  Create a list or collection of these non-zero pixels, retaining their original numerical values (which represent colors).
3. **Discard:** Ignore/remove all the zero value pixels from consideration
4. **Rearrange:**  Organize the extracted non-zero pixels into a 3x3 output grid. The top-left element of the output is the bottom-left non-zero pixel in input, and proceeds row by row. The pixels will be arranged in the order they appear, filling the 3 x 3 output grid from left to right and top to bottom.

Essentially, the transformation extracts all colored pixels from the large input grid and compacts them into a smaller 3x3 grid, preserving their original colors and filling the grid in a specific order, the details of the order seem to read the input grid from bottom to up, left to right.
