## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DE5F8FE50>

**output:**
```

5 8 6
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DDE4FADD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (10x10) of colored pixels into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid seems to have a sparse distribution of colored pixels, with the majority being white (value 0). The output grid appears to be a condensed representation, retaining some of the non-zero colored pixels from the input, but with altered positions. The colors themselves are preserved during transformation. There appears to be some relationship between the original locations of the pixels that are included and not included.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10, 10]  # Input grid dimensions
      elements: pixels
      element_type: integer # 0-9 representing colors

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Output grid dimensions
      elements: pixels
      element_type: integer

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:  # Represented by integers 0-9
      position: [row, column] # Within the grid

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Selects specific pixels from the input grid.
    criteria:  # Criteria for selection needs to be determined.

  - type: rearrangement
    description: Arranges the selected pixels into a new 3x3 grid.
    method:  # The specific rearrangement logic needs to be determined.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains pixels
  - output_grid contains pixels
  - selected_pixels are a subset of input_grid pixels
  - output_grid is formed by rearranged selected_pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Selection:** Examine the input grid and select all non-zero (non-white) pixels.
2. **Ordering of selected pixels:** Sort to-be-outputted pixels based on their original row position from lowest to highest.
3.  **Arrangement:** Arrange these pixels in a way that preserves the spatial relationship relative to each other based on row and relative col locations, fitting into the bounds of a 3x3 matrix.
4. **Output:** form into a 3 x 3 grid

In summary - extract the colored blocks and re-arrange them relative to each other into a smaller grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
