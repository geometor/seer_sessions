## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9
0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7B1DE5F8F6D0>

**output:**
```
3 1 8
9 7 6
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B1DE5F8FE50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (10x10) of colored pixels into a smaller grid (3x3) of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have several single, isolated, non-zero pixels scattered throughout a field of zero-value (white) pixels.  The output grid seems to be composed of only the non-zero pixels from the input grid, rearranged into a compact 3x3 form, with relative ordering based on row.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains single-color pixels scattered on a background of 0.

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains only the non-zero pixels from the input grid, rearranged.

  - action: extraction
    description: Non-zero pixels are extracted from the input_grid.

  - action: rearrangement
    description: Extracted pixels are reordered and placed into the output_grid.
    
  - relationship: input_output
    description: The output_grid is derived from the input_grid by extracting and rearranging non-zero pixels

  - property: order_input
    description: input grid has an implicit ordering, going across each row, starting from top-left.

  - property: order_output
    description: output grid preserves ordering but reduces the size of grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Scan** the input grid row by row, from top to bottom and left to right.
2. **Identify and extract** all non-zero (colored) pixels.
3. **Maintain** the original order of discovery of these pixels.
4. **Create** 3 x 3 output.
5. **Place** the non-zero pixels into the output grid sequentially, from top left, following row major order, and filling all 3x3 spaces. If there aren't enough non-zero values to fill the output grid, use 0's.
6. if there are too many non-zero values, then ignore the ones that don't fit.

Essentially, the transformation extracts all colored pixels, preserves their order of appearance, and arranges them into a 3x3 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
