objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10, 10]  # Input grid dimensions
      elements: pixels
      element_type: integer # 0-9 representing colors

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Output grid dimensions
      elements: pixels
      element_type: integer

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:  # Represented by integers 0-9
      position: [row, column] # Within the grid

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Selects specific pixels from the input grid.
    criteria:  # Criteria for selection needs to be determined.

  - type: rearrangement
    description: Arranges the selected pixels into a new 3x3 grid.
    method:  # The specific rearrangement logic needs to be determined.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains pixels
  - output_grid contains pixels
  - selected_pixels are a subset of input_grid pixels
  - output_grid is formed by rearranged selected_pixels
