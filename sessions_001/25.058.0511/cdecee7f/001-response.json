The input grid appears to have several single, isolated, non-zero pixels scattered throughout a field of zero-value (white) pixels.  The output grid seems to be composed of only the non-zero pixels from the input grid, rearranged into a compact 3x3 form, with relative ordering based on row.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
