            "text": "Okay, here's an assessment of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the corresponding code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the derived code are partially correct. The core idea of identifying connected components of green (3) pixels and changing them to yellow (4) based on the component size is valid. However, the implementation has a flaw related to how it identifies the \"connectedness\". The depth-first search (DFS) implementation is only consider *cardinal* directions (up, down, left, and right). It is important to accurately find the *size* of the group of connected green pixels. The tests clearly show many discrepancies on pixels that should change, or should not change, colors.\n\nThe strategy to fix this is:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Failing Examples:** Carefully examine the provided input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Pinpoint the exact locations where the code's output deviates from the expectation.\n2.  **Review the natural language program**: Refine the program so there is no ambiguity in the definition of *connected*.\n3.  **Prepare a detailed YAML report**: Capture observations on object properties.\n4.  **Iterate**: Provide an updated program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using manual analysis and reasoning):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Observation: The two pixels in the 'L' shape in the transformed output are not connected, and are missed by the search.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 3\n    *   Observation: Similar issue, the 'L' shaped group is missed. Also, a large group has an error at (6,3)\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 15\n    *   Observation: many errors detecting the connected components.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 17\n    * Observation: Several errors detecting the components, including groups of three that are not L shaped.\n*  **Example 5:**\n    *    Pixels off: 69\n    *   Observation: Large groups are not identified and many groups that should change are missed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 004\nobjects:\n  - id: green_pixel\n    color: 3\n    description: A pixel with the value 3 (green).\n  - id: yellow_pixel\n    color: 4\n    description: A pixel with the value 4 (yellow).\n  - id: connected_component\n    description: A group of adjacent green pixels. Adjacency includes pixels sharing a side.\n    properties:\n        size: The number of pixels included in the group\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_connected_components\n    description: Find all groups of connected green pixels.\n  - name: change_color\n    description: Change the color of a green pixel to yellow based on component size.\n    condition: >\n      If a connected component of green pixels has a size greater than 2,\n      all pixels in that component change to yellow.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. For each green (3) pixel, find its connected component. A connected component is a group of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (shares a side, not just a corner) to at least one other green pixel in the component.\n2.  **Determine Size:** Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each connected component.\n3.  **Conditional Color Change:** If the size of a connected component is greater than 2, change all pixels within that component from green (3) to yellow (4). If a connected component's size is 1 or 2, the pixels remain green.\n4.  All non-green pixels are unchanged.\n5. The final result is output.\n\n"
