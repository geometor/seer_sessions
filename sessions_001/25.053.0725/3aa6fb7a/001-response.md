Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to determine the transformation rule. Here's my approach:

**1. Observation and Fact Gathering**

I will start by carefully observing the input and output grids, noting the objects, their positions, colors, and any changes between the two states. I'll document these observations as facts in a YAML block.



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input grid contains two distinct azure (8) colored objects."
  - object_1: "A vertical line of two azure pixels at grid position (1,1) & (2,1) (row, col)."
  - object_2: "A horizontal line of two azure pixels at (3,4) & (3,5)."
  - change_1: "A new white pixel (1) appears between the two azure pixels of object_2 at (4,4)."
  - change_2: No change in color or size for object_1 or object_2
```



**2. Transformation Rule Description**

Based on my observations, I'll formulate a natural language description of the transformation rule, in a concise way.
*   Locate all objects comprised of 2 pixels of color azure (8).
*   For horizontal objects, insert a pixel of color white (1) in the row below the first pixel.

**3. Next Steps**
In the next phase (coder), I would work on crafting the python function to implement the transformation.
