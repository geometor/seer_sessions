There are many different colors present, forming various shapes and patterns. The most obvious observation is a large cross-like shape in the input, which is seemingly simplified/modified in the output. There's an apparent reduction in noise or extraneous pixels. Specifically, some sequences of digits that stretch to length 3 or 4 have been shortened to length 2. Certain parts of the pattern are removed entirely where many different number series intersect, and other parts are shortened or altered.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
