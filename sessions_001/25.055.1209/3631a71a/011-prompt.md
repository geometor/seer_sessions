Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all regions of color '9' (maroon). These regions can be single pixels or connected groups of pixels forming various shapes.
2.  **Remove** the '9' (maroon) regions.
3.  **Replace** each removed '9' region with a new color. The replacement color is determined by the context of the removed region, which may includes all colors in the input grid. The context considers surrounding colors, the shape of the removed '9' region, bordering colors of the region, and possibly patterns that extend beyond the immediate neighboring pixels. The goal of replacement is to create cohesive shapes/areas.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
