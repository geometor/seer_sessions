There are many different colors present, seemingly scattered randomly.  The most noticeable feature is a large block of maroon (9) in the input that is missing in the output. It looks like the transformation removes large connected regions of a single color. There are smaller single-color regions and isolated pixels that remain. It might be based on size of the region.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Leave all other pixels unchanged.\n5.  **Construct output:** Create the output grid by keeping only the pixels that were not part of the removed regions.\n\n"
