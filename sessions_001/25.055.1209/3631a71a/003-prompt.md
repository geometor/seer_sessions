Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1. Identify contiguous regions: Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous regions of pixels that share the same color. A contiguous region is defined as a group of pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically).
2. Calculate region sizes: For each identified contiguous region, calculate its size (the number of pixels it contains).
3. Apply a size threshold: Define the size threshold.  The size of the largest maroon block observed, it's removed in output.
4. Remove large regions: Remove any contiguous regions whose size is greater than or equal to this threshold. Leave all other pixels unchanged.
5. Construct output: Create the output grid by keeping only the pixels that were not part of the removed regions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
