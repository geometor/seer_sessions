The blue pixels form seemingly random, disconnected shapes.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 30x30 grid that shares a high degree of similarity with the input grid. It also contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels, but with the addition of green (3) pixels. The green pixels appear to replace a large, contiguous block of white pixels in the input, forming a rectangular shape. The placement of the green area seems strategically located to encompass all instances of shapes formed of blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

This rectangle's boundaries are defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all blue pixels.\n3.  **Replace with Green:** In the output grid, keep all the original blue cells from input. Replace all white (0) pixels *within* the bounding rectangle (identified in step 2) with green (3) pixels. Leave all other pixels (those outside the bounding rectangle) unchanged from the input grid. This means white pixels outside the rectangle, stay white.\n\nIn essence, the transformation finds the smallest rectangle containing all blue shapes and fills that rectangle with green, while preserving the original blue shapes within it.\n"
