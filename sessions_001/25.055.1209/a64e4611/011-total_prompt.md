Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color blue (value 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Bounding Rectangle:** Calculate the smallest rectangular region that encloses all identified blue pixels. This rectangle is defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the blue pixels.
3.  **Transform Non-Blue Pixels:** Within the bounding rectangle, change the color of *every* pixel that is *not* blue (1) to green (3).
4. **Preserve Input:** Pixels outside of the bounding box are not changed.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
