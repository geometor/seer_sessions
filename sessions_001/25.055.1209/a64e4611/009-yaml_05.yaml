observations:
  - object_types:
      - name: blue_shape
        description: One or more connected blue (1) pixels.
      - name: bounding_box
        description: The smallest rectangle encompassing all blue_shapes.
      - name: other_pixels
        description: Pixels within the bounding box that are not blue.
  - properties:
      - color:
          values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
          note: "0: white, 1: blue, 3: green"
      - bounding_box_coordinates:
          attributes: [min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col]
  - actions:
      - name: identify_bounding_box
        description: Find the smallest rectangle containing all blue pixels.
      - name: transform_pixels
        description: Change the color of all non-blue pixels within the bounding box to green.
  - constraints:
      - Only pixels within the bounding box are considered for color changes.
      - Blue pixels within the bounding box remain unchanged.
