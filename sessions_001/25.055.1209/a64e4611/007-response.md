Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 30x30 grid filled with pixels of two colors: blue (1) and white (0). The blue pixels form seemingly random, disconnected shapes.
*   **Output Grid:** A 30x30 grid that shares a high degree of similarity with the input grid. It also contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels, but with the addition of green (3) pixels. The green pixels appear to replace a large, contiguous block of white pixels in the input, forming a rectangular shape. The placement of the green area seems strategically located to encompass all instances of shapes formed of blue pixels.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - entity: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [30, 30]
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        description: Forms disconnected shapes.
      - color: white
        value: 0
        description: Background.

  - entity: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [30, 30]
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        description: Same as input, maintains original positions.
      - color: white
        value: 0
        description: Background, reduced area compared to input.
      - color: green
        value: 3
        description: Replaces a rectangular section of white pixels.

  - relation: rectangle_replacement
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: A rectangular region of white pixels in the input grid is replaced by green pixels in the output grid. The region includes all blue objects.

  - property: bounding_rectangle
    entity: blue_shapes
    description: The smallest rectangle that can enclose all blue shapes.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Shapes:** Locate all disconnected shapes formed by blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Bounding Rectangle:** Find the smallest rectangular region within the grid that completely encloses all identified blue shapes. This rectangle's boundaries are defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all blue pixels.
3.  **Replace with Green:** In the output grid, keep all the original blue cells from input. Replace all white (0) pixels *within* the bounding rectangle (identified in step 2) with green (3) pixels. Leave all other pixels (those outside the bounding rectangle) unchanged from the input grid. This means white pixels outside the rectangle, stay white.

In essence, the transformation finds the smallest rectangle containing all blue shapes and fills that rectangle with green, while preserving the original blue shapes within it.
