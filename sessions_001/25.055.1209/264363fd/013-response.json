The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8), green (3), yellow (4), grey (5), magenta (6). The input grid contains distinct rectangular regions of green (3) within a larger azure (8) background.  There are also isolated instances of yellow (4) within the green regions, and arrangements of magenta(6), grey(5) and yellow(4) pixels at the bottom right. The output grid seems to modify green and yellow pixels. Grey, and magenta, arrangements remains but changes position inside the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

One structure per region. Structure maintains its shape.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replaces the border of the Green regions and the yellow pixels within them with grey, and relocates a composite object (structure_1).\n"
