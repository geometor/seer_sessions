## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C4BB32EF0A0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C4BB32EE440>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation and possibly some color changes, and seems like a mirroring operation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers 0-9

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: input grid is transformed to output grid

relationships:
  - input grid elements map to output grid elements
  - colors might change during transformation
  - positions of elements are very important and likely to have been moved

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotation/Mirroring:** The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Imagine taking the input grid and turning to the left. Alternatively, the entire input is diagonally mirrored across the axis going from top left to bottom right.

2.  **Color Preservation/Change:** The colors from the original positions are maintained during the rotation. No new colors added.

In summary, the transformation is either a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation or a mirror on a diagonal, preserving the original colors in the input grid and placing them into the equivalent positions in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
