# Example

**input:**
```
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7AE1FE247F10>

**output:**
```
9 5 9 9
5 5 9 9
9 9 5 9
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), which represent different colors. The primary objective seems to be to transform the input grid into the output grid based on some underlying rule or pattern. The shape of the output is different than the shape of the input and values are moved.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is 3x4 (rows x columns).
      The output grid is 6x4 (rows x columns).
      The output grid's height is double of input grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - actions:
    - name: double_height
      description: The height of the input is doubled.
    - name: reposition
      description: Values of 5 and 9 are maintained but repositioned.
  - relationships:
      - The output grid's height equals two times the input grid's height
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Rows:** Duplicate each row of the input grid to create a new grid that is twice the height of the original.

2.  **Adjust Placement**:

    *   Column 1, value 9, row 1, moves to Column 1, row 1
    *   Column 2, value 9, row 1, moves to Column 1, row 3
    *   Column 3, value 5, row 1, moves to Column 2, row 1
    *   Column 4, value 9, row 1, moves to Column 3, row 1

    *   Column 1, value 5, row 2, moves to Column 1, row 2
    *   Column 2, value 5, row 2, moves to Column 1, row 5
    *   Column 3, value 9, row 2, moves to Column 2, row 2
    *   Column 4, value 9, row 2, moves to Column 3, row 3

    *   Column 1, value 9, row 3, moves to Column 1, row 6
    *   Column 2, value 5, row 3, moves to Column 2, row 3
    *   Column 3, value 9, row 3, moves to Column 2, row 6
    *   Column 4, value 9, row 3, moves to Column 3, row 2

    *   All values in column 4 do not change location.

3.  The positions of the existing digits are then rearranged/shifted within the expanded grid according to a specific, yet-to-be-fully-determined, pattern. I will analyze the movements to specify it more precisely.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
