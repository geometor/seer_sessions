<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1340x1330 at 0x7A3E7887B9D0>Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to vary, but white (0) is consistently the background. We see objects composed of contiguous pixels of the same color. There appear to be two main types of objects, let us call them set A and set B for the time being. The objects move in some way.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: ARC_transformation
objects:
  - type: set A
    properties:
      - shape: contiguous block
      - colors: varied (e.g., azure, orange, magenta, maroon, yellow)
      - initial_position: variable
      - size: variable (2x2, 3x1, etc.)
  - type: set B
    properties:
     - shape: contiguous block
     - colors: varied
     - initial_position: variable
     - size: variable

actions:
  - type: object_replacement
    description: set A appears to be replaced by set B

relationships:
  - set_A: set_B
  - set_B: set_A

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Divide all the colored objects (non-white pixels) in the input grid into two sets. Call the first set "set A" and the second set "set B."

2.  **Object Replacement**: Delete set A objects and re-draw set B objects.

3. The output grid will be identical to the input grid, but with one set of objects being replaced with another set of objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
