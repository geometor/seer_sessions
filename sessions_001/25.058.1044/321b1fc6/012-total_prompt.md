"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine New Color:** For each region, compare to row index. Top part of azure (8) is replaced by Orange color (7). Bottom part of azure (8) is replaced by magenta color (6).
3.  **Substitute:** Replace all pixels within each identified region with the new color that was determined in step 2.
4.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid with the color substitutions. All other colors remain the same.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observing the first training example. While it correctly identified the core concept of replacing azure (8) regions, it made an incorrect assumption about the determining factor for the replacement color (initially assuming it was solely based on row index, and then attempted to use presence of 7 or 6). The test results show inconsistencies, indicating a more complex rule is at play. Some of the regions are correctly colored while others are not. The presence of colors 7 and 6 do influence the change of color, but not in a direct replacement approach on the first pass of the program.

The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Carefully examine each input-output pair:** Pay close attention to *all* azure regions, not just the first one encountered. The position of the region and the location of existing 6 and 7 regions is important.
2.  **Identify a consistent rule:** The rule must accurately predict the output for *all* training examples.
3.  **Prioritize Simplicity:** Given the ARC priors, simpler geometric and topological rules are more likely than complex ones.
4.  Use the presence of existing objects to influence color change.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand the pattern, let's collect some metrics. I'll use `code_execution` to determine the regions of azure, orange and magenta, as well the overall extents.

```python
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    azure_regions = find_regions(grid, 8)
    orange_regions = find_regions(grid, 7)
    magenta_regions = find_regions(grid, 6)
    
    print(f"  Azure (8) Regions: {azure_regions}")
    print(f"  Orange (7) Regions: {orange_regions}")
    print(f"  Magenta (6) Regions: {magenta_regions}")
    print(f"  Grid Shape: {grid.shape}")

      - shape: variable, contiguous
    actions:
      - change_color:  The color of the azure region is changed based on its vertical position relative to other objects and the overall grid.
  - object: grid
    description: The 2D array representing the image.
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows, cols)
    actions:
      - update: The grid is updated by changing the color of specific regions.
  - rule: color_change_condition
    description: Determines the new color of an azure_region
    logic:
      - condition_1: "If any part of azure region is on the same row where existing objects color is orange (7), the entire azure region changes to orange (7)."
      - condition_2: "If any part of azure region is on the same row where existing objects color is magenta (6), the entire azure region changes to magenta (6)."
      - condition_3: "If the region starts on row index less than 4, changes to orange (7)."
      - condition_4:  "Otherwise, the region changes to magenta (6)."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2. **Check for existing color on same rows:**
    * If any row that contains part of an azure region ALSO contains an orange (7) pixel, change all pixels in that azure region to orange (7).
    * If any row that contains part of an azure region ALSO contains a magenta (6) pixel, change all pixels in that azure region to magenta (6).
3.  **Determine New Color (if no orange/magenta on same row):** For each azure region *not yet changed*, determine the starting row index of the region.
    *   If the starting row index is less than 4, change all pixels in that region to orange (7).
    *   Otherwise, change all pixels in that region to magenta (6).
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

The critical refinement is to prioritize checking for the presence of color orange(7) or magenta(6) on *any of the rows occupied by the azure region* . The initial assumption focused on color of starting row, but the examples reveal the presence of other colors in the occupied rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
