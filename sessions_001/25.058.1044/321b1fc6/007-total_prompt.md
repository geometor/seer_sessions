Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Copy all Input Pixels**: Copy all the pixels from the input to the same position in the output.
2.  **Identify Target Square (if present)**: Locate any 2x2 square with the color pattern: orange (top-left), magenta (top-right), yellow(bottom-left), and maroon (bottom-right).
3. **Example 1 Transformation** If the target is located:
      * Create two copies of any identified 2x2 square.
      * Move the first copy to align with the bottom edge of the output grid, maintaining its original x-coordinate.
      * Move the second copy of this square to the bottom-right corner of the output grid.
4. **Remove Azure**: Specifically for example 1 - Remove the azure pixel.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
