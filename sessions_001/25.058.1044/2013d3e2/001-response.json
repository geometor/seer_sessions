Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids are 10x10, containing various colored pixels. Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), with a central \"object\" composed of different colors.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are 3x3, seemingly extracting a part of the central object from the input grid. The white space (0s) is not entirely uniform. It appears that leading 0's are removed in both dimension.\n*   **Object of Interest:** The central colored object in the input grid seems to be the primary focus of the transformation. It has varying shapes and colors across examples.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves isolating and extracting a specific 3x3 region from the center of the input grid, with removal of empty rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
