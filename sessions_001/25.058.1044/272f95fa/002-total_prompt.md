<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2172x2354 at 0x7A3E7887AFD0>Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids with single-digit integer values (0-9), representing different colors. The input grids seem to have a recurring pattern: horizontal and vertical lines of the color azure (8) intersecting at a central point. The output grids retain the azure (8) lines and introduce new colored regions (red (2), magenta (6), blue (1), yellow(4), green(3)) within the quadrants formed by the azure lines. These regions appear to be rectangular and fill the space between the azure lines.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: azure_lines
    type: lines
    color: azure (8)
    orientation: horizontal and vertical
    property: forms a cross shape
  - name: colored_regions
    type: rectangles
    colors: [red (2), magenta (6), blue (1), yellow(4), green(3)]
    property: fill quadrants formed by azure_lines

actions:
  - name: fill_quadrants
    description: Fill the quadrants formed by the intersecting azure lines with new colored rectangular regions.
    parameters:
      - color: Assigned based on a consistent scheme.

relationships:
   - azure_lines intersect to create four quadrants.
   - colored_regions are bounded by azure_lines.
   - colors assigned to new regions appear to be based on their row position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Existing Structure:** Locate the horizontal and vertical lines of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. These lines intersect, forming a cross shape and dividing the grid into four quadrants.

2.  **Maintain Azure Lines:** Keep the azure (8) lines unchanged in the output grid.

3.  **Fill Quadrants:** In each of the four quadrants defined by the azure lines.
    *   In the first example we see that moving downward each region changes color, from red, to magenta, then blue.
    *   The same pattern can be seen in the second example.
4. Maintain the original dimensions of the grids.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
