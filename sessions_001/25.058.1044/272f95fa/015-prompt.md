Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Azure Cross:** Locate the cross-shaped structure formed by connected azure (8) pixels. This cross has a horizontal line and a vertical line. The central horizontal line is maintained.
2.  **Retain central row:** the row that consists of all azure(8) pixels is unchanged.
3. **Fill Above:** Fill the area *above* the central horizontal line of the azure cross and bounded on the left, right, and top by the azure pixels, with red (2).
4. **Fill Left Below, Top row:** Fill the top-left area *below* the horizontal central line and to the *left* of the vertical azure line using yellow (4). This region starts on first row below central row.
5.  **Fill Left Below, Rest:** Fill the remaining area *below* the horizontal central line and to the *left* of the vertical azure line with magenta (6).
6. **Fill Right Below:** Fill the area *below* the central horizontal line and to the *right* of the vertical azure line, with green (3).
7.  **Fill Bottom:** Fill the region at the bottom bounded by the lower arms of the azure cross with blue(1).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
