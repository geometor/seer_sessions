The input grids seem to have a recurring pattern: horizontal and vertical lines of the color azure (8) intersecting at a central point. The output grids retain the azure (8) lines and introduce new colored regions (red (2), magenta (6), blue (1), yellow(4), green(3)) within the quadrants formed by the azure lines. These regions appear to be rectangular and fill the space between the azure lines.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
