Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the distinct non-zero digits (1 and 2, representing blue and red respectively) in the first row of the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:**
    *   Expand the blue object (value 1) to the right, filling cells with 1s.
    *   Expand the red object (value 2) to the left, filling cells with 2s.
    *   Expansion of each object terminates in the middle, such that the objects take up an equal amount of horizontal space.

3.  **Insert Separator:** Place a single cell with the value 5 (grey) between the expanded blue and red regions. This will likely be in the horizontal center of the row between the two objects.

4.  **Other rows**: keep other rows unchanged, filled entirely with 0.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
