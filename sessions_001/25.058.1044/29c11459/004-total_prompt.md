Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the transformation logic for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits (representing colors).
*   The input grid contains a single row with two distinct non-zero digits (1 and 2) among a background of zeros.
*    The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
*   The non-zero digits in the input grid appear to be "expanded" or "filled" horizontally in the output grid.
*   There's a new digit (5) introduced in the output grid, positioned between the expanded regions of the original digits.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 11
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: object_group
    label: blue_object
    properties:
      initial_value: 1
      color: blue
      location: row 1, column 0
  - type: object_group
    label: red_object
    properties:
      initial_value: 2
      color: red
      location: row 1, column 10
  - type: object_group
    label: grey_object
      properties:
        initial_value: 5
        color: grey
        location: output_grid
        shape: single cell

actions:
  - type: expansion
    agent: blue_object
    properties:
      direction: horizontal
      extent: until_midpoint
      fill_value: 1
  - type: expansion
    agent: red_object
    properties:
      direction: horizontal
      extent: until_midpoint
      fill_value: 2
  - type: insertion
    agent: gray_object
    properties:
        location: between blue and red
        value: 5

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Blue and red objects are at opposite ends of a row in the input.
  - type: spatial
    description: grey object is placed at the midpoint between the expanded blue and red regions.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the distinct non-zero digits (1 and 2, representing blue and red respectively) in the first row of the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:**
    *   Expand the blue object (value 1) to the right, filling cells with 1s.
    *   Expand the red object (value 2) to the left, filling cells with 2s.
    *   Expansion of each object terminates in the middle, such that the objects take up an equal amount of horizontal space.

3.  **Insert Separator:** Place a single cell with the value 5 (grey) between the expanded blue and red regions. This will likely be in the horizontal center of the row between the two objects.

4.  **Other rows**: keep other rows unchanged, filled entirely with 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
