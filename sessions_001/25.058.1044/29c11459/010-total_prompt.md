Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (5 rows x 11 columns).
*   Most cells are filled with '0' (white).
*   The input grid contains two distinct non-zero values: '3' (green) on the left and '7' (orange) on the right, both located in the fourth row.
*   The output grid maintains the '3' and '7' in the same row.
*   The '3' and '7' in output grid is expanded.
*    A new value '5'(grey) is appeared in the center of '3' and '7'.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_pixel
    value: 3
    color: green
    initial_position: [3, 0]  # [row, col]
    shape: single cell

  - id: orange_pixel
    value: 7
    color: orange
    initial_position: [3, 10]
    shape: single cell

  - id: grey_pixel
      value: 5
      color: grey

actions:
  - name: expand_left
    target: green_pixel
    description: Replicate the green pixel to the right until the middle.

  - name: expand_right
    target: orange_pixel
    description: Replicate the orange pixel to the left until the middle.

  - name: insert_grey
    description: create grey pixel in between left expansion and right expansion

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Green and orange pixels are horizontally separated in the same row.
  - type: expansion
    description: Both coloured pixels expands towards each other.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Find the green pixel (value 3) and the orange pixel (value 7) in the fourth row of the input grid.
2.  **Expand Green:** Replicate the green pixel horizontally to the right, until the middle of between green and orange pixel.
3.  **Expand Orange:** Replicate the orange pixel horizontally to the left, until the middle of between green and orange pixel.
4.  **Insert Grey**: Create the grey pixel (value 5) in between left and right expansion.
5. **Preserve others**: Other pixels in the grid keep its value.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
