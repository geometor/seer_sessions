- example: 1
  correct: True
  input_objects:
    - color: azure
      position: [4, 4]
  output_objects:
    - color: azure
      positions: [[4, 4], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 8]]
  transformation: horizontal_expansion_right
  notes: azure expands from a single cell to fill to the right edge of the grid

- example: 2
  correct: False
  input_objects:
    - color: blue
      position: [4, 3]
    - color: red
      position: [5, 7]
  output_objects:
    - color: blue
      positions: [[4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 3]]
    - color: red
      positions: [[5, 7], [5, 8]]
  transformation: horizontal_expansion_left_and_right
  notes: blue expands from position to the left edge, red expands from its position to right edge.

- example: 3
  correct: False
  input_objects:
      - color: orange

    - color: red

  transformation: horizontal_expansion_to_edges
  notes: orange expands from its position to the left, red expands from its position to the right.
