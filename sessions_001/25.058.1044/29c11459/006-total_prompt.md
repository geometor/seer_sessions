Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the distinct non-zero digits (1 and 2, representing blue and red respectively) in the first row of the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:**
    *   Expand the blue object (value 1) to the right, filling cells with 1s.
    *   Expand the red object (value 2) to the left, filling cells with 2s.
    *   Expansion of each object terminates in the middle, such that the objects take up an equal amount of horizontal space.

3.  **Insert Separator:** Place a single cell with the value 5 (grey) between the expanded blue and red regions. This will likely be in the horizontal center of the row between the two objects.

4.  **Other rows**: keep other rows unchanged, filled entirely with 0.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good first attempt, focusing on the first training example. It correctly identified the core concept of expanding two objects from the first row towards the center and inserting a separator. However, it failed on subsequent examples. The primary issue is that the initial code *only* modified the first row and assumed that all tasks would involve horizontal expansion of two objects on the first row with all other rows remaining empty. It did not correctly account for various object positions, different separator colors, or different transformation logic.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Broaden Object Identification:** Instead of only considering the first row, we need to identify objects across the entire grid.
2.  **Generalized actions:** Identify the source and target colors and locations.
3. **Contextual transformation**: look at the whole grid, not just the first row.

      output_objects: [yellow (4) from (2,3) to (2,5), orange (7) from (2,6) to (2,7)]
      transformation: "Expand yellow and orange horizontally towards each other from starting positions."

      correct: False

      transformation: "Replicate objects on first row based on position of non-zero numbers."
      correct: True
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-zero pixels in the input grid. Note their color (value) and initial positions.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion (Conditional):** If there are two non-zero pixels on the *same* row, and if those same colors appear expanded on that row in the output, they might be expanding.
    *   For each pair of objects of different colors on the *same row*: Determine if they expand horizontally towards each other in the output.
        *   If they do expand, determine the start and end positions of their expansion in the output.  Replicate this expansion in the predicted output.  There might be multiple on the same row expanding.
        *   If they *don't* expand, other transformation logic may be at play (see other rules).

3. **Row Replication (Conditional):** If the non zero values in a single row are replicated from their positions in the input, replicate the value across the output row between the positions.
    *   If this rule applies, consider that there might be a different transformation for other cases.

4.  **Other Cases**: If Rules 2 & 3 do not explain the change, look for additional or different transformations.

The critical improvement here is the conditionality and the move away from assuming *only* the first row matters, or only two objects. We're now starting to generalize by looking at the relationship between *any* two objects on the *same* row, and checking if *their* behavior in the input matches the expansion pattern. We are also accounting for complete row replication, which seems like another kind of transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
