Each color is represented by a single digit integer. The transformation seems to involve a mirroring or rotation of some kind, as the positions of the colors change in a specific pattern. The azure (8) and blue (1) colors in particular seem pivotal to figuring this out.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
