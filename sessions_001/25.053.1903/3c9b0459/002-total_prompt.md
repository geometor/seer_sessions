# Example

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70E23E25B730>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70E23E07BE50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored squares. Each color is represented by a single digit integer. The transformation seems to involve a mirroring or rotation of some kind, as the positions of the colors change in a specific pattern. The azure (8) and blue (1) colors in particular seem pivotal to figuring this out.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          color: integer (0-9)
          position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Re-arranges the colors in grid cells

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation is a reflection or mirroring of the grid along its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and counter diagonal (top-right to bottom-left), which in effect is a 180-degree rotation of the grid.

1.  **Input Grid**: Consider the input grid of 3x3.
2. **Rotate 180 Degrees.** Take the 3x3 grid, consider the center to be fixed and rotate the entire grid clockwise by 180 degrees.
3. The grid would result in the given output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
