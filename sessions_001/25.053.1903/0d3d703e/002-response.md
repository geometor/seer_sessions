"""
The transformation rule is a simple integer substitution. Every instance of the number 3 is replaced with 4, every instance of the number 1 is replaced with 5 and every instance of 2 is replaced by 6. The grid dimensions (3x3) remain unchanged, and the relative positions of all elements stay the same. Essentially this is can be described as addition of +1 to each element, and elements can only contains single digits, 0-9..
