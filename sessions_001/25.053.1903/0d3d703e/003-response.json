            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly handled the first example, it failed on subsequent examples because it only considered a limited set of substitutions (3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6). The results clearly show a more general pattern of cyclical increment/decrement, which is related to modular arithmetic of a circular/dial/clock, but not simple increment. The provided natural language transformation program must be redefined.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples**: Examine all input/output pairs to identify the *full* set of transformations, not just the ones present in the first example.\n2.  **Identify the modular arithmetic**: Determine the modulus (the size of the cycle) and the direction (increment or decrement).\n3.  **Update the natural language program**: Rewrite the description to accurately reflect the *complete* transformation rule. The initial attempt did not establish a relationship with the full, circular, number line (dial).\n4.  **Develop facts**: Create a yaml block to contain the relevant information for the natural language program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting the specific discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Works as expected (already documented).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `2 3 8`\n    *   Expected: `6 4 9`\n    *   Actual: `6 4 8`\n    *   Discrepancy: 8 should become 9, but remains 8.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `5 8 6`\n    *   Expected: `1 9 2`\n    *   Actual: `5 8 6`\n    *   Discrepancy: 5 should become 1, 8 should become 9, 6 should become 2. None of the transformations occurred.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `9 4 2`\n    *   Expected: `8 3 6`\n    *   Actual: `9 4 6`\n    *   Discrepancy: 9 should become 8, 4 should become 3, 2 became 6 as per initial, incorrect hypothesis.\n\nFrom these discrepancies, we can infer that a simple substitution is insufficient. There's a circular increment/decrements happening, which, after some investigation, turns out to be decrementing with wrap around.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 002\nobjects:\n  - description: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: 3x3\n      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors\ntransformation_rule:\n  type: modular_arithmetic\n  operation: decrement\n  modulus: 10 # Integers from 0 to 9, then wrapping back to 9\n  details:\n    - \"Each element in the input grid is decremented by 1. If the element is 0, the transformation wraps the result to 9 (0 - 1 becomes 9 due to the circular dial).\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule takes each number (representing a color) in the input grid and decrements it by one. This decrement operation is modular, meaning it wraps around. Specifically, when the number 0 is decremented, it becomes 9. The grid dimensions remain constant, and only the values of the elements change according to this circular decrement rule (a circular dial).\n\nExample:\n- 0 becomes 9\n- 1 becomes 0\n- 2 becomes 1\n- 3 becomes 2\n- 4 becomes 3\n- 5 becomes 4\n- 6 becomes 5\n- 7 becomes 6\n- 8 becomes 7\n- 9 becomes 8\n"
