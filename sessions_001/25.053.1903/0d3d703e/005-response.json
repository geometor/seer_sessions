            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting Python code were incorrect. The core misunderstanding is that the transformation isn't a simple decrement of each pixel value. The provided code implements `(x - 1) % 10`, which *does* decrement and wrap around, but this is not what the examples show when combined together. There is a relationship between inputs and outputs, but it is *not* consistent across all the examples. Therefore, the concept of a *single* consistent transformation rule is flawed. Each example seems to represent a constant addition of some value to all the cells, but with different addition constants.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** We need to discard the idea of a single, universal decrement rule. Instead, focus on the *relationship* between the input and output grids *within each example*.\n2.  **Calculate Offsets:** For *each* example, determine the numerical difference (modulo 10) between corresponding input and output pixel values. This will reveal the specific transformation rule *for that example*.\n3. **Describe Per-Example Rules:** Create a natural language program that handles the per-example transformation, rather than a global transformation.\n4.  **YAML Facts:** Update the YAML to reflect the per-example nature of the transformations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including the calculated offset:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]`\n    *   Observed Output (from previous code): `[[2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1]]`\n    *   Offset Calculation:\n        *   `4 - 3 = 1`\n        *   `5 - 1 = 4`\n        *   `6 - 2 = 4`\n        * The offset seems inconsistent. Let's calculate it modulo 10:\n        *(4-3)%10 = 1*\n        *(5-1)%10 = 4*\n        *(6-2)%10 = 4*\n     *Observation: It appears that the add value is not consistent across the entire grid.*\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]]`\n    *   Observed output: `[[1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 7]]`\n    *   Offset Calculation (modulo 10):\n     *(6-2)%10 = 4*\n     *(4-3)%10 = 1*\n     *(9-8)%10 = 1*\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]]`\n    *    Observed output: `[[4, 7, 5], [4, 7, 5], [4, 7, 5]]`\n    *   Offset Calculation (modulo 10):\n      *(1-5)%10 = 6*\n      *(9-8)%10 = 1*\n      *(2-6)%10 = 6*\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]]`\n    *   Observed output: `[[8, 3, 1], [8, 3, 1], [8, 3, 1]]`\n    *   Offset Calculation (modulo 10):\n        *(8-9)%10 = 9*\n        *(3-4)%10 = 9*\n        *(6-2)%10 = 4*\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: grid_1\n        type: grid\n        values: [[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: grid_2\n        type: grid\n        values: [[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]\n    transformations:\n        description: \"Add a value to the entire input.

There isn't one global transformation; instead there appears to be a per-cell addition operation.\n\nFor each example:\n1.  The input is a grid of numbers.\n2. The output is the result of adding a value to the input on a cell-by-cell basis.\n3. The added values must be calculated modulo 10.  `(output_cell - input_cell) % 10`\n4. The values added are different across the different examples, and also vary across cells *within* an example\n\nThe previous assumption of a *single* transformation rule across all training examples appears incorrect.\n"
