task: 002
objects:
  - description: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
transformation_rule:
  type: modular_arithmetic
  operation: decrement
  modulus: 10 # Integers from 0 to 9, then wrapping back to 9
  details:
    - "Each element in the input grid is decremented by 1. If the element is 0, the transformation wraps the result to 9 (0 - 1 becomes 9 due to the circular dial)."
