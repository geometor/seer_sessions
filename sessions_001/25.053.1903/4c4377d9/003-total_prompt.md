Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid's rows are duplicated and rearranged. The first row is duplicated at the bottom. Row 2 is duplicated above row 2. And finally Row 3 is duplicated above row 3.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with double the number of rows
    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((2 * input_rows, input_cols), dtype=int)

    # Duplicate and shift first row to the end
    output_grid[:input_rows-1, :] = input_grid[1:, :]
    output_grid[input_rows-1,:] = input_grid[0,:]

    # Add first row at the bottom
    output_grid[input_rows, :] = input_grid[0, :]

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
