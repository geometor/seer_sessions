objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns]
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: [0-9] representing colors
    instances:
      input_grid:
        dimensions: [3, 4]
      output_grid:
        dimensions: [6, 4]

actions:
  - name: duplicate_rows
    description: Replicates rows based on a pattern.
  - name: rearrange_pixels
    description: Shifts pixels based on duplication

relationships:
  - input_grid.elements -> output_grid.elements: The pixels in the input grid are related to the pixels in the output grid through a transformation rule of rearrangement.
  - input_grid.dimensions -> output_grid.dimensions: input and output dimensions are different, and there should be an equation relating them.
