# Example

**input:**
```
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x70E23E07B8B0>

**output:**
```
9 5 9 9
5 5 9 9
9 9 5 9
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x384 at 0x70E23E07A290>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid through a combination of duplication and rearrangement of elements, seemingly based on specific patterns. The most obvious change is an increase of rows, with a specific pixel rearrangement rule.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns]
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: [0-9] representing colors
    instances:
      input_grid:
        dimensions: [3, 4]
      output_grid:
        dimensions: [6, 4]

actions:
  - name: duplicate_rows
    description: Replicates rows based on a pattern.
  - name: rearrange_pixels
    description: Shifts pixels based on duplication

relationships:
  - input_grid.elements -> output_grid.elements: The pixels in the input grid are related to the pixels in the output grid through a transformation rule of rearrangement.
  - input_grid.dimensions -> output_grid.dimensions: input and output dimensions are different, and there should be an equation relating them.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input:** Observe the input grid's dimensions (3x4) and pixel arrangement. Note the values and placement of the maroon (9) and gray (5) colors.

2.  **Row Duplication with alternating shifts**: The input grid has each of it's rows duplicated with a shifting pattern. The first row is duplicated at the bottom. Row 2 is duplicated above row 2. And finally Row 3 is duplicated above row 3.

3. **Output**: form output grid of rearranged pixels


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
