            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved replacing azure pixels in the middle row with gray pixels. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more nuanced pattern. It's not *always* the middle row, and it appears the transformation depends on the presence and position of other colors, specifically black (which isn't in the color map but seems to be present.) and possibly red. Therefore the strategy is to carefully analyze each example to deduce the exact conditions under which the azure-to-gray replacement occurs. The current implementation is too simplistic and needs to account for more contextual factors.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using a conceptual code execution approach - no actual python execution here):**\n\nLet's create a more detailed view of the grids. I will use text representations, using numbers for colors, and `_` for black, assuming a color map extension for simplicity.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input:  `888\\n888\\n888`\n    *   Output: `888\\n555\\n888`\n    *   Result:  `888\\n555\\n888` (Correct)\n    *   Observation: Middle row azure becomes gray.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input:  `_8_\\n888\\n_8_`\n    *   Output: `_8_\\n555\\n_8_`\n    *   Result:  `_8_\\n555\\n_8_` (Correct)\n    *   Observation: Middle row azure becomes gray, even with black surroundings.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input:   `8_8\\n888\\n8_8`\n    *   Output:  `8_8\\n555\\n8_8`\n    *   Result:   `8_8\\n555\\n8_8` (Correct)\n    *   Observation: Middle row azure becomes gray.\n\n*  **Example 4:**\n    *   Input:  `8888\\n8228\\n8888`\n    *   Output: `8888\\n8228\\n8888`\n    *   Result:  `8888\\n8228\\n5555` (Incorrect)\n    *   Observation: Azure in the middle row are NOT changed to gray when red pixels are present in the same row. The algorithm failed to account for the presence of the red '2' pixels.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: `888\\n8_8\\n888`\n    *    Output: `888\\n8_8\\n888`\n    *    Result: `888\\n5_5\\n888` (Incorrect)\n     * Observation: Middle row azure are not changed to gray when black is in the same row.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    observation: \"Azure pixels in the middle row are transformed to gray.\"\n    conditions:\n      - \"Middle row contains only azure pixels.\"\n  - id: 2\n    observation: \"Azure pixels in the middle row are transformed to gray, black pixels are unchanged.\"\n    conditions:\n      - \"Middle row contains azure and black pixels.\"\n  - id: 3\n    observation: \"Azure pixels in the middle row are transformed to gray, black pixels in other rows do not affect transformation.\"\n    conditions:\n        - \"Middle row contains azure and black pixels.\"\n  - id: 4\n    observation: \"Azure pixels in the middle row are NOT transformed to gray when red is also in middle row.\"\n    conditions:\n      - \"Middle row contains azure and red pixels.\"\n  - id: 5\n    observation: \"Azure pixels in middle row with black pixels are not changed to gray.\"\n    conditions:\n        - \"Middle Row Contains Azure and black pixels\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify the middle row of the input grid.\n2.  Examine the pixels within the middle row.\n3.  If the middle row contains *only* azure pixels, change all azure pixels in that row to gray.\n4. If the middle row contains azure pixels, AND red or black pixels, DO NOT change the azure pixels.\n5.  All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n"
