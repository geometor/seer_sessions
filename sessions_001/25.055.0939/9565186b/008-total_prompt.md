## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 1
8 1 3
8 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x743B5B969A50>

**output:**
```
1 1 1
5 1 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x743B5B96A380>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The colors are represented by single digits (0-9).  The most obvious change is the replacement of certain colors with others, seemingly based on their original color. There isn't an apparent geometric transformation (rotation, reflection, etc.). The transformation seems to focus solely on color replacement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0-9)

actions:
  - type: color_replacement
    details:  Specific colors are replaced with other specific colors.

relationships:
  - input_grid:  Corresponds to a specific output_grid.
  - input_color:  Maps to an output_color.

observations:
    - color_1: remains color_1
    - color_8: changes to color_5
    - color_2: changes to color_5
    - color_3: changes to color_5
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   If a pixel is color 8, change it to color 5.
    *   If a pixel is color 2, change it to color 5.
    *   If a pixel is color 3, change it to color 5.
    *    If a pixel is any other color, keep its original value.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.

In essence, colors 8, 2 and 3 are replaced by color 5, while other colors are conserved.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
