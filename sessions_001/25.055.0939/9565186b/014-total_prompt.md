## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 2
8 8 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x743B5B96A380>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
5 5 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x743B5B969BA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The primary colors (or values) involved are red (2) and azure (8) in the input, and red (2) and gray (5) in the output. The transformation seems to be localized to the central row, specifically affecting the azure-colored pixels. Other pixels remain unchanged. It looks like a color replacement based on some condition.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        values: [2, 8, 5]
      location: 
        row: [1, 2, 3]
        column: [1, 2, 3]
      
actions:
    - name: color_change
      agent: unknown
      preconditions:
        - color: 8 #azure
        - location:
            row: 2
      postconditions:
          - color: 5 #gray
          
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally."
  
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target pixels:** Find all pixels with the color azure (8) that are located in the second (middle) row of the grid.
2.  **Change the color:**  Change the color of these identified pixels to gray (5).
3.  **Preserve other pixels:** All other pixels in the grid retain their original color.

In essence, the transformation rule is: "Replace azure pixels in the middle row with gray pixels; leave all other pixels unchanged".

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
