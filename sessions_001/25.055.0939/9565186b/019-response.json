The input grid contains a variety of colors (green, yellow, azure, blue), while the output grid appears to simplify the colors, retaining the yellow row and changing the rest to gray. The key seems to be identifying and preserving the row that is entirely composed of a single color, and specifically, yellow (color 4).  All other cells become gray (color 5).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
