## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x743B5B968520>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x743B5B969A50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains red (2), blue (1), and azure (8) pixels. The output grid retains the red pixels (2) in their original positions but replaces both the blue and azure pixels with gray (5) pixels. The transformation seems to be a color replacement based on location and original color. The red color is a constant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 3x3 matrix of pixels
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - cell_values: integers representing colors
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          input: [1, 2, 8] #blue, red, azure
          output: [2, 5] #red, gray
      - position: (row, column) #relative to grid origin (top-left is (0,0))
  - action: color_replacement
    description: Certain colors are replaced with another color.
    details:
      - original_colors: [1, 8]  # Blue and Azure
        replacement_color: 5   # Gray
      - original_color: 2          #red
        replacement_color: 2   #red
  - relationship: unchanged_pixels
    description: red pixels position and color is unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels in the input grid.
2.  **If** a pixel's color is blue (1) or azure (8), **replace** it with gray (5).
3.    **If** a pixel's color is red (2), it **remains** unchanged.
4.  **Output** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
