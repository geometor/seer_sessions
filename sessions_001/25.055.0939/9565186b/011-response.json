            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple color replacement rule (8, 2, and 3 become 5). The provided feedback shows that this works for the training examples. Since all training examples succeeded, the initial natural language program and the generated code are correct. No errors were found, indicating that the simple color substitution rule accurately captures the transformation for all training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSince all training examples passed, there's no need for a major strategy shift. We will simply document the facts and the natural language program as initially conceived. The primary goal here is to ensure the documentation accurately reflects the transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nSince no errors were presented, and we don't have access to `code_execution` to inspect individual grids, the metrics will confirm the success. We can infer success based on the problem description confirming the code worked on all training examples.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Contains colors 8, 2, 3, and others.\n    *   Output: Colors 8, 2, and 3 are replaced with 5; others are unchanged.\n    *   Result: Success.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Contains colors 8, 2, 3, and others.\n    *   Output: Colors 8, 2, and 3 are replaced with 5; others are unchanged.\n    *   Result: Success.\n*   **Example 3:**\n      *   Input: Contains colors 8, 2, 3, and others.\n      *   Output: Colors 8,2, and 3 are replaced by 5, other are unchanged.\n      *   Result: Sucess.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - contains_colors: [8, 2, 3, other colors]\n    actions:\n      - replace_color: [8, 5]\n      - replace_color: [2,5]\n      - replace_color: [3,5]\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - contains_colors: [5, other colors]\n    derived_from: input_grid\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Locate all pixels with colors azure (8), red (2), and green (3) within the input grid.\n2.  **Replace with Gray:** Change the color of the identified pixels to gray (5).\n3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels in the input grid retain their original colors.\n4. **Output:** The output grid is the result of these replacements.\n"
