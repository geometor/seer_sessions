observations:
  - task: 39e19088
  - objects:
    - description: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
      properties:
        - color: Defined by the pixel value (1-9).
        - position: Original row and column index.
    - description: Output grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: Same as the input grid.
        - initial_state: Filled with zeros.
  - actions:
    - description: Collection of non-zero elements from input, row by row.
      details: The original relative order of elements within each row must be preserved.
    - description: Placement of collected elements at the bottom of the output grid.
      details:
        - Starting row: The last row of the output grid.
        - Filling order: Left-to-right within each row, moving upwards to the next row when a row is filled.
        - wrapping: if the top row is full, filling starts in the last row.
  - constraints:
        - description: The transformation preserves the count of each non-zero color.
        - description: Transformation is performed in-place; input is not directly modified.
