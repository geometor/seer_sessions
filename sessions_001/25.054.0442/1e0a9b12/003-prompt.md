Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to collect all non-zero elements from the input grid and place them, maintaining their original horizontal order, in the last row of the output grid. The remaining cells of the output grid are filled with zeros.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by moving all non-zero elements to the bottom row,
    maintaining their original horizontal order, and filling the rest with zeros.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input, filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Extract all non-zero elements from the input grid.
    non_zero_elements = [val for row in input_grid for val in row if val != 0]

    # Place the non-zero elements in the last row of the output grid.
    output_grid[-1, :len(non_zero_elements)] = non_zero_elements

    return output_grid

0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0
1 4 6 9
```
match: ERROR: could not broadcast input array from shape (5,) into shape (4,)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
