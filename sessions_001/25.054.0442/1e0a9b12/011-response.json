            "text": "Here's an assessment of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors, along with the requested deliverables:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of downward movement and the special rule for the maroon (9) pixel. However, the errors in the test cases reveal a flaw in the \"Shift Down\" logic. The current implementation only moves pixels down if the space *immediately* below is empty. It doesn't account for \"cascading\" moves, where a pixel might need to move down multiple rows if there are multiple empty spaces below it. The strategy is to enhance the downward movement to be iterative.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Issue: The '4' in the second column doesn't drop to the bottom because another '4' is blocking it earlier in the drop. The second '0' is missing too.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Issue: Similar to Example 1, the `8` does not move to the correct place.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Pixels Off: 6\n    *    Issue: more complex - several don't cascade\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - description: Single pixels of any color.\n    properties:\n      color:\n        type: integer (0-9)\n        description: Represents the color of the pixel.\n      position:\n        type: tuple (row, column)\n        description: The location of the pixel in the grid.\n\nactions:\n  - name: Shift Down\n    description: >\n      Each pixel attempts to move down as many rows as possible. The movement\n      stops if it encounters another pixel (of any color, including 0/white) or\n      the bottom edge of the grid.\n  - name: Maroon to Bottom-Right\n    description: >\n      If a maroon pixel (color 9) is present, it moves to the bottom-right\n      corner of the grid.  The value in the bottom right is overwritten and\n      cleared from its previous position.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Treat each individual pixel in the input grid as a separate object.\n\n2.  **Iterative Shift Down:** For each object (pixel), attempt to move it down one row at a time. Continue moving the object down until it reaches the bottom row or encounters another object (any non-empty cell) directly below it.\n\n3. **Bottom-Right (Maroon):** If a maroon colored object (value 9) exists in the grid, move it to the bottom-right cell of the grid. Any object that had that location is removed. The maroon object is removed from its previous position.\n"
