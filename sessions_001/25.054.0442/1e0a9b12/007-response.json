The transformation seems to involve moving or copying certain colored pixels based on their spatial relationships and possibly their values. The most obvious changes are the movement of the maroon (9) pixel and the azure (8) pixel. The yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels seem to be unaffected other than by the potential movement on to of them.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
