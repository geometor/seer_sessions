## Example 2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
4 4 4 2 4 1 4
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
2 2 2 2 2 2 2
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
4 4 4 2 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7AA3AFE5F6D0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 1 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AA3AFBCAF50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are yellow (4), red (2), and blue (1). The input appears to be a larger grid, and the output is a smaller, seemingly extracted portion of the input. The key feature seems to be the blue (1) pixel and its surrounding yellow (4) pixels. The red (2) pixels in the input seem to be completely removed in the output. The output grid is always 3x3.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (input), 3x3 (output)
      - elements: pixels
      - colors:
        - 1: blue
        - 2: red
        - 4: yellow

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (1-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A 3x3 subgrid is extracted from the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The blue pixel in the output is surrounded by yellow pixels.
    details: The position of the blue pixel serves as the center of the 3x3 output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the Blue Pixel:** Scan the input grid to find the single blue (value 1) pixel.  If no single blue pixel is not present, a copy the input to the output
2.  **Define the Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 grid.
3.  **Center the Blue Pixel:** Place the blue pixel in the center cell (row 2, column 2) of the output grid.
4.  **Extract Surroundings:** From the input grid, extract the pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to the blue pixel.
5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Place the colors of the extracted pixels in the corresponding positions of the output grid, using the position of the blue pixel as the center point. Thus any pixels not adjacent to the blue pixel are lost.

In simpler terms, the transformation finds the blue pixel in the input, and creates a 3x3 output grid centered on that blue pixel, copying the colors of the surrounding pixels from the input. All other parts of the input grid are discarded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
