```python
"""
Extracts a subgrid from the input grid based on different centering criteria:

1. If a single blue pixel exists, extract a 3x3 grid centered on it.
2. If no blue pixel exists, extract the lower-left corner of the input grid (Example 1's rule).
3. If multiple blue pixels or other patterns exist: Find a section of the input that contains key features,
   extract that sub-grid and return. The size of this subgrid seems related to features of the input (e.g. Example 3).

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The current code and natural language program are based on a hierarchical decision process:

1. **Blue Pixel Priority:** It prioritizes finding a single blue pixel and extracting a 3x3 grid around it. This works perfectly for Example 2.
2. **No Blue Pixel - Lower Left:** If no blue pixel is found, it defaults to extracting the lower-left 2x2 corner. This works for Example 1.
3. **Fallback - Hardcoded Slice:**  A hardcoded slice is used as a fallback, which is tailored specifically to (and *incorrectly* for) Example 3.  This highlights a major weakness: the approach lacks a general solution for cases with multiple blue pixels or complex patterns.

The strategy needs to shift from these specific rules to a more general pattern recognition approach. The hardcoded slice must be replaced with a mechanism that *dynamically* determines the output subgrid based on the input grid's content, that handles multiple blue pixels.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations relevant to formulating a generalized rule:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Blue Pixels: None
    *   Result: Correct.  Lower-left corner extracted.
    *   Key Observation:  The output is a 2x2 subgrid from the lower-left. There are no blue pixels.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Blue Pixels: One at (1, 5) (row 1, col 5, 0-indexed).
    *   Result: Correct. 3x3 grid centered on the blue pixel.
    *   Key Observation: The presence of a *single* blue pixel dictates a 3x3 extraction centered on it.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (11, 11)
    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Blue Pixels: Multiple. A horizontal line of blue pixels across row 5.
    *   Result: **Incorrect**. The hardcoded slice [1:6, 0:5] happens to capture part of the input that, with modification, could return the expected output. The error is not in the slicing logic itself, so much as that the 5x5 output sub-grid is not determined. The program does not have instructions to derive this size.
    *   Key Observation: Multiple blue pixels exist in a distinct pattern (a horizontal line). The output subgrid seems to *select an area of interest based on a pattern*, but this sub-grid needs adjustment to include the expected pixels.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - id: 1
    input_shape: [5, 5]
    output_shape: [2, 2]
    blue_pixels: []
    objects:

          - location: lower_left
          - size: [2, 2]

          - blue_pixel_pattern: horizontal_line
    transformation:
      - action: extract_subgrid
        properties:
          - size: [5,5]
          - start_row: unknown # needs to be determined
          - start_col: unknown # needs to be determined

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid for blue pixels (color 1).**
2.  **If a single blue pixel is present:**
    *   Extract a 3x3 subgrid centered on the blue pixel. This is the output grid.
3.  **If no blue pixels are present:**
    *   Extract a 2x2 subgrid from the lower-left corner of the input grid. This is the output grid.
4.  **If multiple blue pixels are present:**
    * Identify a section of blue pixels from the input, that best represents the blue objects.
    * Extract the 5x5 area of the input grid that contains the identified pixels.
    * Adjust the sub-grid to align with any changes in color.

The core issue is how to generalize step 4. The current program does not yet correctly identify how to handle multiple blue pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
