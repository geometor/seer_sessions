## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2
0 1 1 0 0 1 0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7AA3AFEF69E0>

**output:**
```
1 1 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x7AA3AFE5F6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9). The output is a much smaller grid, also with colored pixels. The colors in the input are white, blue, and red, while the colors in the output are blue and white. The output seems related to a specific feature within the input, specifically blue regions. The output width appears to be determined by the number of discrete blue colored regions along a single axis.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** Locate all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Count Distinct Regions:** Consider these blue regions as distinct entities only when fully separated in the horizontal axis by a non-blue color.
3.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid will have a height of 1 and a width equal to the number of distinct blue regions counted in the previous step.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the output grid. For each distinct blue area found, place a blue(1) block in the output.
5.  If no blue regions are present fill the last column with white(0).

In simpler terms: The transformation counts the number of horizontally separated blue regions in the input grid and creates a single-row output grid where each cell corresponds to one of these regions. The presence of any blue region creates a blue pixel; otherwise, the result will be a white pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
