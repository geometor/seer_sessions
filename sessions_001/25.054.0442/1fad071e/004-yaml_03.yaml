  - task_description: |
      The task transforms an input grid into a 1x5 output grid.
      The output grid contains only blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
  - example_1:
      input_shape: unknown
      output_shape: 1x5
      output_colors: [blue, white]
      output_blue_pixels: 2
      output_white_pixels: 3
      notes: "Output is 1x5 grid with 2 blue and 3 white pixels."
  - example_2:
      input_shape: unknown
      output_shape: 1x5
      output_colors: [blue, white]
      output_blue_pixels: 4
      output_white_pixels: 1
      notes: "Output is 1x5 grid with 4 blue and 1 white pixels."
  - example_3:
      input_shape: unknown
      output_shape: 1x5
      output_colors: [blue, white]
      output_blue_pixels: 4
      output_white_pixels: 1
      notes: "Output is 1x5 grid with 4 blue and 1 white pixels."
  - general_observations: |
      All output grids are 1x5.
      All output grids contain only blue and white pixels.
      The number of blue and white pixels varies between examples.
