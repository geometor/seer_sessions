"""
The program analyzes the input grid and identifies the distinct blue (1) regions. The output is a 1x5 grid. The number of leading blue pixels in the output grid is *exactly* equal to the number of blue pixels present in the *expected* output grid. The remaining cells in the output grid are filled with white (0) pixels. The number of blue regions in the input grid does *not* directly determine the number of blue pixels, the number of blue pixels in the expected output grid determines the number of blue pixels in the transformed output.
