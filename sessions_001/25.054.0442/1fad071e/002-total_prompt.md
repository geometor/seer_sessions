## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2
1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7AA3AFE5F6D0>

**output:**
```
1 1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x7AA3AFEF6C20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger, multi-colored grid (input) into a smaller, seemingly simplified grid (output). The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The output grid only contains white (0) and blue (1). The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (9x9 input vs. 1x5 output). The reduction in size suggests a summarizing or aggregating operation, not a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping. The colors present in the output suggest we're looking for the presence/absence of those colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 9x9
      colors: [white, blue, red]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 1x5
      colors: [white, blue]
  - observation: output_size_smaller
    description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: color_reduction
    description: The output grid contains a subset of the colors in the input grid.
  - action: count_colors
    description: counts the occurrences of each color in the input.
  - relationship: output_represents_input
    description: The output somehow summarizes a characteristic of the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Analyze Input:** Examine the input grid and identify all unique colors present.
2. **Check for Blue:** If the color blue (1) is present anywhere in the input grid, the output begins a series of blue (1) pixels.
3. **Count Blue:** Count the number of distinct areas of contiguous blocks of 1s.
4.  **Output Blues:** Output the a number of blue pixels equal to the number of distinct blocks.
5. **Remaining Pixels:** If there are any further steps, output is white.
6. **Fixed Width:** The output grid appears to always have a width of 5. Fill out all other unassigned output with white.

Essentially, the program appears to perform a presence and quantity check for the color blue, resulting in the output showing the number of distinct areas, up to a maximum of at least 2, and padding the rest of a 5-width grid with white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
