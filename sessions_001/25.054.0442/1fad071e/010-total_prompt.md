Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The current code identifies disconnected blue regions (objects) and counts them. The output grid's width is intended to be the number of blue regions, with all cells blue except the last one, which is white. However, the code consistently produces an output grid that is too wide. The issue lies in the logic that determines the output grid size. It adds 1 to the count of blue objects to accommodate the white space. This white space is not always present in the target output as observed in the evaluation. The results suggest an overestimation of the required output width.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Output Size Logic:** The core problem is the output grid's size. The current program adds one to accommodate an extra white cell which is supposed to represent a separator. The updated logic should consider the examples that do not have a white separator.

2.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately describe the corrected transformation logic.

**Metrics and Reports:**

Here's a summary of each example, the results of executing the code, and observations:
| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Expected Output Shape | # Blue Objects | # Blue Pixels | Result | Notes                            |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------------- | :------------- | :----------- | :----- | :------------------------------- |
| 1       | (9, 9)      | (1, 7)       | (1, 5)               | 6             | 10        | Fail   | Overestimated width by two      |
| 2       | (9, 9)      | (1, 7)        | (1, 5)               | 6              | 10        | Fail   | Overestimated width by two      |
| 3       | (9, 9)      | (1, 8)       | (1, 5)          | 7           | 12         | Fail   | Overestimated width by three |

**YAML Block - Facts:**

```yaml
task: 0086155f
examples:
  - input:
      objects:
        - color: blue
          count: 6
          notes: disconnected regions
      grid_size: (9, 9)
    output:
      grid_size: (1, 5)
      pattern: "[blue, blue, blue, blue, white]"
  - input:
      objects:
        - color: blue
          count: 6
          notes: disconnected regions
      grid_size: (9, 9)
    output:
      grid_size: (1, 5)
      pattern: "[blue, blue, blue, blue, white]"
  - input:
      objects:
        - color: blue
          count: 7
          notes: disconnected regions
      grid_size: (9, 9)
    output:
      grid_size: (1, 5)
      pattern: "[blue, blue, blue, blue, white]"
transformation_rule: "Count the disconnected blue regions. Output is all blue with the final space white."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify all disconnected regions (objects) of blue (1) pixels.  Disconnected regions are defined as groups of adjacent blue pixels, where adjacency includes both orthogonal (up, down, left, right) and diagonal neighbors.

2.  **Count Blue Objects:** Count the total number of disconnected blue regions found in the input grid.

3.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** Create a new grid of size `1 x N+1`, where `N` is the number from step two.

4. **Populate Grid:** make all the pixels in the output grid blue.

5. **Add White Separator:** Change the last pixel to white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
