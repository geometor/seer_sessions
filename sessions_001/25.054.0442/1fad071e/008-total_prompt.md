## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 2
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 0 1 1 0
0 1 0 2 2 0 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7AA3AFEF6C20>

**output:**
```
1 1 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x7AA3AFB9ED40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 9x9 grid containing single-digit integers (0-2), representing different colors. The output is a 1x5 grid, also containing single-digit integers (0 and 1). The colors in the input seem to be primarily blue (1), white (0), and red (2). The output is mostly blue, with one white pixel at the end. There's a significant reduction in size and complexity from input to output. It appears we are extracting and simplifying specific information from the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  input:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-2)
    color_representation:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
  output:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x5
    elements: integers (0, 1)
    color_representation:
      0: white
      1: blue
  observations:
    - input_contains: multiple colors (blue, white, red)
    - output_contains: two colors (blue, white)
    - size_reduction: significant reduction in grid size from input to output
    - potential_pattern:  counting blue (1) areas or the number of color changes

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count Disconnected Blue Regions:** Examine the input grid. Identify and count the number of distinct, non-contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels. Two blue regions are considered separate if they are not connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

2. **Append White:**. Append single white (0)

3. **Construct output**: create a 1 x N array, filling blue where N is the sum of regions and the appended white.

The core idea seems to be to identify and quantify blue areas.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
