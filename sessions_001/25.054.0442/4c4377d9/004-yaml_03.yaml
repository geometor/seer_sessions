examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - object_1: {color: 9, shape: irregular, position: top-left}
        - object_2: {color: 5, shape: irregular, position: top-center}
        - object_3: {color: 9, shape: irregular, position: top-right}
      output_objects:
        - object_1: {color: 9, shape: irregular, position: various}
        - object_2: {color: 5, shape: irregular, position: various}
        - object_3: {color: 9, shape: irregular, position: various}
      transformations:
        - description: The input grid appears to be mirrored along both the horizontal and vertical axes.  The top-left quadrant of the input becomes the top-right and bottom-left quadrants of the output, and so on.
      notes: >
       The transformation essentially creates a 2x2 grid of the reflected image.
       input [A, B, C, D] produces [[A,B,C,D],[C,D,A,B],[A,B,C,D],[C,D,A,B]

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - object_1: {color: 4, shape: irregular, position: corners}
        - object_2: {color: 1, shape: rectangle, position: center}
      output_objects:
        - object_1: {color: 4, shape: irregular, position: corners}
        - object_2: {color: 1, shape: rectangle, position: center}
      transformations:
        - description: Similar to Example 1, the grid seems to be mirrored both horizontally and vertically, creating four quadrants.
      notes: Same mirroring transformation as the first example.

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - object_1: {color: 9, shape: irregular, position: top-left, bottom-right}
        - object_2: {color: 4, shape: rectangle, position: others}
      output_objects:
        - object_1: {color: 9, shape: irregular, position: various}
        - object_2: {color: 4, shape: rectangle, position: various}
      transformations:
        - description: Horizontal and vertical mirroring, creating a 2x2 quadrant structure.
      notes:  Consistent transformation.

  - example_4:
      input_objects:
        - object_1: {color: 3, shape: irregular}
        - object_2: {color: 5, shape: irregular}
      output_objects:
         - object_1: {color: 3, shape: irregular}
         - object_2: {color: 5, shape: irregular}
      transformations:
        - description:  The input grid is mirrored horizontally and vertically.
      notes: Consistent transformation.
