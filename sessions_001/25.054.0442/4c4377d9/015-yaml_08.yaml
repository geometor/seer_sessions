task: 014
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is always transformed into an output grid that is twice the height and the same width.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers 0-9
      shape: variable
  - object: reflected_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers 0-9
      shape: same as input_grid
      derivation: vertical reflection of input_grid
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers 0-9
      shape:
        height: 2 * input_grid height
        width: same as input_grid width
    derivation: concatenation of reflected_grid and input_grid, stacked vertically
  - action: vertical_reflection
    input: input_grid
    output: reflected_grid
    description: Each row of the input_grid becomes a row in reflected_grid, but in reverse order.
  - action: vertical_stacking
    input:
      - reflected_grid
      - input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The reflected_grid is placed above the original input_grid, creating a new grid twice the height.
