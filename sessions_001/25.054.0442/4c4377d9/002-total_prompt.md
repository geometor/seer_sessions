## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7AA3AFC784C0>

**output:**
```
9 5 9 9
5 5 9 9
9 9 5 9
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x384 at 0x7AA3AFC7B2E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are maroon (9) and gray (5). The output grid appears to be a vertically elongated version of the input grid, with a specific rearrangement of the maroon and gray pixels. The transformation seems to involve a repeating pattern or a form of vertical mirroring/duplication with alteration.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x4
      elements: [9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9]
      colors: [maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, gray, gray, maroon, maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, maroon]

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x4
      elements: [9, 5, 9, 9, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9]
      colors: [maroon, gray, maroon, maroon, gray, gray, maroon, maroon, maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, gray, gray, maroon, maroon, maroon, gray, maroon, maroon]

actions:
  - name: vertical_elongation
    description: The input grid is expanded vertically.
  - name: pattern_rearrangement
    description: The arrangement of colors (maroon and gray) changes during elongation.

relationships:
    - input_grid is transformed into output_grid.
    - output_grid height is twice the input_grid height.
    - output_grid width is the same as input_grid width.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Initialization:** Start with the input grid (3x4).
2. **Duplication:** Duplicate the input grid vertically once to double the height, result is a 6x4 grid.
3. **Alteration:**
    Starting from the original top row, which remains untouched:
    * The original second line is moved at the bottom of the grid
    * The original thord line, swap color 5 with 9 and color 9 with 5


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
