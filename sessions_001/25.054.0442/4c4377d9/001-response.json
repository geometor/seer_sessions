Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are maroon (9) and gray (5). The output grid appears to be a vertically elongated version of the input grid, with a specific rearrangement of the maroon and gray pixels. The transformation seems to involve a repeating pattern or a form of vertical mirroring/duplication with alteration.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
