The input grid appears to be a larger, repeating pattern, while the output is a smaller, condensed version of that pattern. The transformation seems to involve extracting a specific sub-grid from the input. The colors and their relative positions within the sub-grid are preserved. The overall impression is one of pattern extraction or down-sampling, where a representative \"tile\" is extracted from a larger \"tiled\" input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
