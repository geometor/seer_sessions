The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a reduction or extraction process. The colors (represented by numbers) are consistent between the input and output, indicating that the color of a pixel itself is not being transformed, but their positions and overall grid dimensions are.  Specifically, it seems like every other column might be removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
