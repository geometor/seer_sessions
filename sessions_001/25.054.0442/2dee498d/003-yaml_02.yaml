observations:
  - task: "Select alternating columns from the input grid."
  - objects:
      - input_grid: "A 2D array of colored pixels."
      - output_grid: "A sub-grid of the input, containing only the odd-positioned columns."
      - columns: "Vertical lines of pixels within the grids."
  - properties:
      - column_position: "The position of a column within the grid (first, second, third, etc.)."
      - odd_positioned_column: "A column that is in an odd position (first, third, fifth, etc.)."
  - actions:
      - select: "To choose specific columns based on their position."
      - construct: "To create a new grid from the selected columns."
  - constraints:
      - "The output grid must contain only odd-positioned columns from the input."
      - "The rows are maintained from input to output"
