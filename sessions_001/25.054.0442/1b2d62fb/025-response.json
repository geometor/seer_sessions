The output is a 5x3 grid, also of single-digit integers. The most obvious visual change is a reduction in width. The colors in the output don't directly correspond to all colors of the input, seemingly pulling only white(0) and replacing the blue(1) central column with azure(8).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
