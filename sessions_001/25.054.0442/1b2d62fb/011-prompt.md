Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the Blue Stripe:** Examine the input grid to locate a vertical stripe composed entirely of blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Record Stripe Index:** Note the column index (x-coordinate) where the blue stripe is found.
3.  **Extract Column:** Get all of the pixel values from the input grid at the recorded column.
4.  **Transform Column:** Within this extracted column, *only* replace the blue (1) pixels with azure (8) pixels. Leave other pixel colors unchanged.
5.  **Create Output:** Construct a new grid with a width of 3 and the same height as the input grid.
6.  **Populate Center Column:** Fill the center column of the new grid with transformed values.
7.  **Pad with White:** Fill the left and right columns of the output grid with white (0) pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
