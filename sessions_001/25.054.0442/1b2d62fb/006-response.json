The height/width ratio of the grid also appears important.\n2. **Transpose and Mirror based on the blue line:** It appears that the subgrid to the left of the blue line (inclusive) gets transposed, and then a mirrored version of the transpose gets put below.\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** The output grid has a dynamic size determined by transposing the input grid to the left of and including the blue vertical line.\n4.  **Place Azure Pixels:** The subgrid defined by the region to the left of the blue line is transposed. All pixels in this transposed grid that are not 0 have their color changed to 8. Then a mirrored version of this transposed grid is placed below, creating a dynamic number of azure pixels.\n5. **Fill Remaining with Black:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with black (0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_vertical_line(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the column index of a vertical line of the specified color.\"\"\"\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    for j in range(width):\n        is_line = True\n        for i in range(height):\n            if grid[i, j] != color:\n                is_line = False\n                break\n        if is_line:\n            return j\n    return -1  # Return -1 if no such line is found\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Find the vertical blue line\n    blue_column = find_vertical_line(input_grid, 1)\n\n    # Extract the subgrid to the left of the blue line (inclusive)\n    subgrid = input_grid[:, :blue_column + 1]\n\n    # Transpose the subgrid\n    transposed_subgrid = subgrid.T\n\n    # Create the output grid based on transposed subgrid size and mirrored portion\n    output_height, output_width = transposed_subgrid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height * 2, output_width), dtype=int) # Double height to stack\n\n    #change any non-zero values to azure\n    transposed_subgrid_azure = np.where(transposed_subgrid != 0, 8, transposed_subgrid)\n\n    # Copy the transposed subgrid to top half\n    output_grid[:output_height, :] = transposed_subgrid_azure\n\n    # Create a mirrored version of the top\n    mirrored_top = transposed_subgrid_azure[::-1,:]\n\n    # place on the bottom\n    output_grid[output_height:,:] = mirrored_top\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
