Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core idea of finding a blue stripe and transforming it. However, the code consistently makes a critical error: it *always* replaces the blue pixels with azure, regardless of their position *within* the blue stripe column relative to other colors in that column. The expected outputs show that the azure pixels should only appear in the output where the blue pixel was *also* adjacent to one or more other non-blue, non-white colors. The program also incorrectly assumes there will only ever be a need to pad the output to width of 3. The training data show that the central, modified, column is replicated into columns on the right and/or left depending on where other colors are found.

The core issue is a misinterpretation of *conditional* replacement. The code needs to consider not just the presence of blue, but the blue pixel's context – its neighboring pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Neighborhood Awareness:** The code must be modified to examine the neighbors of each blue pixel *within the identified column*. It should only replace a blue pixel with azure if that blue pixel is adjacent to a pixel that is *not* blue or white (0).

2.  **Output Construction:** The output grid creation is too simplistic and width is static. It needs to dynamically position the transformed column within the output, adding a copy of the transformed column to the left or right based on if non-blue and non-white colors exist on the left or right, respectively.

3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll use the provided training examples to iteratively refine the natural language program and the code. We will pay very close attention to the differences between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output`.

**Metrics and Observations (using the provided examples):**

Here's an analysis of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Blue stripe at x=3.
    *   Pixels incorrectly changed: All blue pixels in the extracted column changed to azure. The program should have only changed to azure in row 4 because it has a maroon (9) neighbor.
    *   The program inserted one column of padding, should have added none.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Blue stripe at x=3.
    *   Pixels incorrectly changed: All blue pixels changed to azure, should be none because there are no non-white and non-blue neighbors.
    *   The program inserted one column of padding, should have added a column to the right because the right neighbor is maroon(9).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Blue stripe at x=3.
    *    Pixels incorrectly changed: all blue pixels changes to azure. The program should have changes to azure in rows 1, 3, 4 and 5 because the input contains neighbors that are no blue or white.
    *   The program inserted one column of padding, should have added a column to the right because the right neighbor is maroon(9).

*    **Example 4:**
     *    Blue stripe at x=3
     *    Pixels incorrectly changes: all blue pixels changed to azure. The program should have changes to azure in rows 2, 4 and 5.
     *    The program inserted one column of padding, should have one column to the left and one to the right.

*    **Example 5:**
     *    Blue stripe at x = 3
     *    Pixels incorrectly changed: all blue pixels changed to azure. The program should have changed row 4 only.
     *    The program inserted one column of padding, should have one column to the right.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: blue_stripe
    description: A vertical column of blue pixels.
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      orientation: vertical
      location: variable (column index)

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
        - green (3)
        - yellow(4)
        - gray (5)
        - magenta (6)
        - orange (7)

        top: pixel or None
        bottom: pixel or None
        left: pixel or None
        right: pixel or None

  - action: conditional_replacement
    description: Replace blue pixels with azure only under a specific condition.
    condition: Blue pixel has at least one neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that is neither blue nor white.

  - action: replicate_column
    description: Add a copy of a column to the left or right of the current column.
    condition: Column contains a pixel that is neither blue nor white.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
       width: 3
       height: same as input grid
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Blue Stripe:** Locate a vertical column in the input grid that consists entirely of blue (1) pixels. If no such column exists, return an empty grid that is the same dimensions as the input.

2.  **Record Stripe Index:** Note the column index (x-coordinate) of this blue stripe.

3.  **Extract Column:** Extract all pixel values from the input grid at the recorded column index.

4.  **Conditional Replacement:** For *each* blue pixel in the *extracted column*:
    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right) in the *original input grid*.
    *   If *any* of these neighbors are a color other than blue (1) or white (0), replace the blue pixel in the extracted column with azure (8).
    *   If all neighbors are blue or white, leave the blue pixel unchanged.

5.  **Create Output Grid:**
     *   Start with an empty grid with a width of 1 and height of the original input
     *   Insert the extracted, and potentially transformed, central column.

6. **Replicate Column - Left**
    * Check the column immediately to the left of the blue stripe. If the column contains a pixel that is neither blue (1) or white (0), insert a copy of the central column to the left.

7. **Replicate Column - Right**
    * Check the column immediately to the right of the blue stripe. If the column contains a pixel that is neither blue (1) or white (0), insert a copy of the central column to the right.

8. **Pad Output:** If the output has width of 1 (only the central column), pad both sides with a single column of zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
