Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the blue column and attempts to extract the adjacent columns. However, it fails to accurately reproduce the expected output in all cases. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Relative Positioning:** The code doesn't correctly maintain the spatial relationships between the blue column and the other colored pixels. It simply extracts the immediate left and right columns, regardless of the original configuration.
2.  Misinterpretation of color changing rule. The rule to change color works, but
    the overall transformation does not correctly arrange the non-blue pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Column Extraction:** Instead of just taking the immediate left and right columns, we need to analyze the relative positions of *all* non-blue pixels with respect to the blue column.
2.  Refine by focusing the transformation, and being more concise about the result

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `7x5` grid. Blue column at index 3.
    *   Expected: Center blue column.
    *   Observed: Extracts columns 2, 3, and 4 but positions colors incorrectly.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `7x5` grid. Blue column at index 3.
    *   Expected: Orange on left, double azure on right.
    *   Observed: Extracts columns 2, 3, and 4, positioning is incorrect.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `7x5` grid. Blue column at index 3.
    *   Expected: Green moved to left, orange on right.
    *   Observed: Extracts columns 2, 3, and 4, positioning is incorrect.

*    **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `7x5` grid. Blue column at index 3.
    *   Expected: Orange moved to left, azure on right.
    *   Observed: Extracts columns 2, 3, and 4, positioning is incorrect.

*    **Example 5:**
    *   Input: `7x5` grid. Blue column at index 3.
    *   Expected: Center blue column.
    *   Observed: Extracts columns 2, 3, and 4, positioning is incorrect.

**YAML Fact Identification:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable (5 in examples)
      columns: variable (7 in examples)
      cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - type: column
    properties:
      index: integer
      pixels: list of integers
    actions:
      - name: find_blue_column
        description: Identifies a column where all pixels are blue (1).
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      row: integer
      column: integer
    actions:
      - name: change_color
        description: Changes blue (1) pixels to azure (8).

transformations:
    - identify blue column:
        - all pixels blue
        - change blue pixels to azure
    - build new grid:
        - include pixels to left and right of blue column
        - preserve relative position of colors to each other
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Column:** Locate the column in the input grid that is completely filled with blue (1) pixels. Record its index.
2.  Change the color of the blue pixels to azure (8).
3.  Build output grid including the columns left and right of the original blue
    column, and place them to the left and right of the new azure column.
4. Maintain color and spatial relationships for all columns.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
