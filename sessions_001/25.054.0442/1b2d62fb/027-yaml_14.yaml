facts:
  - observation: "The output grid consistently consists of the first three columns of the input grid."
  - observation: "The output grid is always 5x3, regardless of the input grid's dimensions."
  - observation: "The transformation involves changing some pixel colors within the extracted three columns."
  - observation: "The 4th column of input is all '1' - this may be important."
  - observation: "Color '8' (azure) appears in the output, replacing some original colors."
  - hypothesis: "The pixels that change color in the output grid seem related to existing elements in the input columns."
  - hypothesis: "The rule for changing the color of the central area may involve the presence, absence, or location of the value 0 in input."
