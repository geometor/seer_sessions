Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x7 grid, and the output is a 5x3 grid. The colors in the input grid are white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid colors are white (0) and azure (8). The input appears to have a vertical blue line in the center. The output appears to maintain the vertical symmetry of the input, using azure in place of blue and maroon, and removing the central blue line of the input, but retaining the position.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x7
    colors: [0, 9, 1] # white, maroon, blue
    description: Contains a central vertical line of blue pixels.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x3
    colors: [0, 8] # white, azure
    description: Appears to be a compressed and recolored version of the input.

  - observation: symmetry
    description: Both input and output exhibit vertical symmetry around a central column.

  - observation: color_mapping
    description: 'Blue (1) in input is not present in output, maroon (9) replaced by azure (8) at relative position. White (0) remains unchanged.'

  - observation: size_reduction
    description:  The output grid is narrower than the input grid (3 columns vs 7 columns).

  - action: column_removal_and_replacement
    description: central column removed, others replaced
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central column:** Locate the middle column of the input grid.
2.  **Remove the central column:** Exclude the central column from further
    processing.
3.  **Copy the reduced grid**. Copy the value of columns at each location.
4. **Replace colors**: if a pixel is 9 change to 8, all other pixels will be 0.
5.  **Output:** Return this new grid as the output.

Essentially the program removes the central column and then replaces the colors.
