            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core idea of finding a blue stripe and transforming it. However, the code consistently makes a critical error: it *always* replaces the blue pixels with azure, regardless of their position *within* the blue stripe column relative to other colors in that column. The expected outputs show that the azure pixels should only appear in the output where the blue pixel was *also* adjacent to one or more other non-blue, non-white colors. The program also incorrectly assumes there will only ever be a need to pad the output to width of 3. The training data show that the central, modified, column is replicated into columns on the right and/or left depending on where other colors are found.\n\nThe core issue is a misinterpretation of *conditional* replacement. The code needs to consider not just the presence of blue, but the blue pixel's context \u2013 its neighboring pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Neighborhood Awareness:** The code must be modified to examine the neighbors of each blue pixel *within the identified column*. It should only replace a blue pixel with azure if that blue pixel is adjacent to a pixel that is *not* blue or white (0).\n\n2.  **Output Construction:** The output grid creation is too simplistic and width is static. It needs to dynamically position the transformed column within the output, adding a copy of the transformed column to the left or right based on if non-blue and non-white colors exist on the left or right, respectively.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll use the provided training examples to iteratively refine the natural language program and the code. We will pay very close attention to the differences between the `Transformed Output` and the `Expected Output`.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using the provided examples):**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Blue stripe at x=3.\n    *   Pixels incorrectly changed: All blue pixels in the extracted column changed to azure. The program should have only changed to azure in row 4 because it has a maroon (9) neighbor.\n    *   The program inserted one column of padding, should have added none.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Blue stripe at x=3.\n    *   Pixels incorrectly changed: All blue pixels changed to azure, should be none because there are no non-white and non-blue neighbors.\n    *   The program inserted one column of padding, should have added a column to the right because the right neighbor is maroon(9).\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Blue stripe at x=3.\n    *    Pixels incorrectly changed: all blue pixels changes to azure. The program should have changes to azure in rows 1, 3, 4 and 5 because the input contains neighbors that are no blue or white.\n    *   The program inserted one column of padding, should have added a column to the right because the right neighbor is maroon(9).\n\n*    **Example 4:**\n     *    Blue stripe at x=3\n     *    Pixels incorrectly changes: all blue pixels changed to azure. The program should have changes to azure in rows 2, 4 and 5.\n     *    The program inserted one column of padding, should have one column to the left and one to the right.\n\n*    **Example 5:**\n     *    Blue stripe at x = 3\n     *    Pixels incorrectly changed: all blue pixels changed to azure. The program should have changed row 4 only.\n     *    The program inserted one column of padding, should have one column to the right.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: blue_stripe\n    description: A vertical column of blue pixels.\n    properties:\n      color: blue (1)\n      orientation: vertical\n      location: variable (column index)\n\n  - object: pixel\n    properties:\n      color:\n        - white (0)\n        - blue (1)\n        - red (2)\n        - green (3)\n        - yellow(4)\n        - gray (5)\n        - magenta (6)\n        - orange (7)\n        - azure (8)\n        - maroon (9)\n      neighbors:  # Adjacency is crucial\n        top: pixel or None\n        bottom: pixel or None\n        left: pixel or None\n        right: pixel or None\n\n  - action: conditional_replacement\n    description: Replace blue pixels with azure only under a specific condition.\n    condition: Blue pixel has at least one neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that is neither blue nor white.\n\n  - action: replicate_column\n    description: Add a copy of a column to the left or right of the current column.\n    condition: Column contains a pixel that is neither blue nor white.\n\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n       width: 3\n       height: same as input grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Blue Stripe:** Locate a vertical column in the input grid that consists entirely of blue (1) pixels. If no such column exists, return an empty grid that is the same dimensions as the input.\n\n2.  **Record Stripe Index:** Note the column index (x-coordinate) of this blue stripe.\n\n3.  **Extract Column:** Extract all pixel values from the input grid at the recorded column index.\n\n4.  **Conditional Replacement:** For *each* blue pixel in the *extracted column*:\n    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right) in the *original input grid*.\n    *   If *any* of these neighbors are a color other than blue (1) or white (0), replace the blue pixel in the extracted column with azure (8).\n    *   If all neighbors are blue or white, leave the blue pixel unchanged.\n\n5.  **Create Output Grid:**\n     *   Start with an empty grid with a width of 1 and height of the original input\n     *   Insert the extracted, and potentially transformed, central column.\n\n6. **Replicate Column - Left**\n    * Check the column immediately to the left of the blue stripe. If the column contains a pixel that is neither blue (1) or white (0), insert a copy of the central column to the left.\n\n7. **Replicate Column - Right**\n    * Check the column immediately to the right of the blue stripe. If the column contains a pixel that is neither blue (1) or white (0), insert a copy of the central column to the right.\n\n8. **Pad Output:** If the output has width of 1 (only the central column), pad both sides with a single column of zeros.\n"
