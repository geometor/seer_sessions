However, it's clear from the test results that the transformation logic has significant flaws in how it handles the surrounding columns and the colors within them. The output grid size is correct (3 columns matching height of original), but the content of those columns and the preservation of colors are not. The primary issue is the incorrect placement and color mapping of pixels from the columns adjacent to the blue column.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Color Handling:** The current code assumes a simple replacement of blue with azure. The examples show that colors in the adjacent columns should be *preserved*, not overwritten with a default value (like 0).\n2.  **Precise Column Copying:** The code needs to correctly copy *all* pixel values from the adjacent columns to the output, maintaining their original colors and vertical positions.\n3. Check the color of each value to the left and right. If left is same as right, output is the same color. If the left is different than the right, the output is black (0).\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nI'll use a structured approach to analyze each example, summarizing key observations. I will create a simple report of the results and compare them to the expected output.\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Blue Column Index | Left Color | Right Color | Output Left | Output Right | Left Correct? | Right Correct? |\n| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :--------- | :---------- | :---------- | :----------- | :------------ | :------------- |\n| 1       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 9          | 9           | 9     | 9       |  no       |      no         |\n| 2       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 0          | 9           | 0    | 9     | yes          |     no         |\n| 3       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 0          | 9           | 0    | 9      | yes        |  no            |\n| 4       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 9          | 9           | 9      | 9      | no         | no         |\n| 5       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 9          | 9           | 9       | 9     | no         | no         |\n\nThe left and right adjacent cells are not always properly accounted for.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      - colors: [0-9]\n      - shape: variable\n  - name: blue_column\n    type: column\n    properties:\n      - color: 1 (blue)\n      - unique: True\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      - colors: [0-9]\n      - shape: (input_height, 3)\n  - name: adjacent_columns\n    type: columns\n    properties:\n       - relative_position: [left, right]\n       - to: blue_column\nactions:\n  - name: find_blue_column\n    input: input_grid\n    output: blue_column_index\n  - name: create_output_grid\n    input: input_grid.shape, blue_column_index\n    output: output_grid\n  - name: fill_center_column\n    input: output_grid, blue_column\n    action: replace color 1 with 8\n    output: modifies output_grid\n  - name: copy_adjacent_columns\n    input: input_grid, blue_column_index, output_grid\n    action: conditional color transformation\n    output: modifies output_grid\n\ntransformations:\n    - condition: if left and right pixels have same value, output is same value\n      action: output_grid[row, 0] = input_grid[row, blue_column_index-1], output_grid[row, 2] = input_grid[row, blue_column_index+1]\n    - condition: if left and right pixels are different colors, output is black (0)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find the Blue Column:** Scan the input grid to locate the single column that is entirely filled with blue (1) pixels. Note its index. If no such column is found, no transformation occurs.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid that has the same height as the input grid but with the width fixed to 3 columns.\n3.  **Transform Blue Column:** The blue column in the input grid is transformed to azure (8) in the output grid's center column (index 1).\n4.  **Process Adjacent Columns**:\n    *   For each row, examine the pixels immediately to the left and right of the original blue column in the input grid.\n        *   If the left and right pixels have the same color, copy these pixels to the left and right of the new azure column in the output.\n        * If the left and right pixels have different colors, the output is black (0).\n\nThis revised natural language program attempts to capture the nuanced color preservation and conditional copying rules that were missed in the first iteration. It highlights the crucial relationship between the adjacent columns and clarifies the transformation's conditional nature.\n"
