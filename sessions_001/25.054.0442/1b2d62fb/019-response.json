The colors in the input grid are white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid colors are white (0) and azure (8). The input appears to have a vertical blue line in the center. The output appears to maintain the vertical symmetry of the input, using azure in place of blue and maroon, and removing the central blue line of the input, but retaining the position.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

White (0) remains unchanged.'\n\n  - observation: size_reduction\n    description:  The output grid is narrower than the input grid (3 columns vs 7 columns).\n\n  - action: column_removal_and_replacement\n    description: central column removed, others replaced\n```"

Copy the value of columns at each location.\n4. **Replace colors**: if a pixel is 9 change to 8, all other pixels will be 0.\n5.  **Output:** Return this new grid as the output.\n\nEssentially the program removes the central column and then replaces the colors.\n"
