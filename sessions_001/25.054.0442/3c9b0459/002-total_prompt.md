## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 1 2
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AA3AFC13760>

**output:**
```
1 8 2
2 1 2
1 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7AA3AFC13910>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers, representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the pixels within the grid, possibly a rotation or reflection. The colors (represented by numbers) maintain their identity during the transformation; only their positions change.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - elements maintain identity across transformation
  - transformation: spatial rearrangement
    details:
      - type:  appears to be a 180-degree rotation
      - input_position: (row, col)
        output_position: (2-row, 2-col) # 0 indexed, consistent with python
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 180-degree rotation of the grid.  Each pixel at position (row, column) in the input grid moves to position (2-row, 2-column) in the output grid, with the row and column indices using zero-based indexing, consistent with python.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
