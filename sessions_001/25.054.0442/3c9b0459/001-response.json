The grids contain single-digit integers, representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of the pixels within the grid, possibly a rotation or reflection. The colors (represented by numbers) maintain their identity during the transformation; only their positions change.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
