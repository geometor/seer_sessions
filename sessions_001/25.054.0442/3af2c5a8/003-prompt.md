1.  **Double Rows:** Duplicate each row of the input grid. This transforms a 3x4 grid into a 6x4 grid.
2.  **Double, and shift Columns:** For the 6x4 grid, duplicate each column. However, in the duplicated column, shift any non-zero values to the position of value to it's right in the input. If there is no value to its right, the values are not placed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
