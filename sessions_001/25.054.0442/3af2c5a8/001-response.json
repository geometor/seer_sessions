The input grid appears to be smaller (3x4) than the output grid (6x8). The primary color involved seems to be '8' (azure), with '0' (white) as the background. The transformation seems to involve some form of expansion or replication of the original pattern. The key operation seems to be duplicating both rows and columns and shifting the elements.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This transforms a 3x4 grid into a 6x4 grid.\n2.  **Double, and shift Columns:** For the 6x4 grid, duplicate each column. However, in the duplicated column, shift any non-zero values to the position of value to it's right in the input.
