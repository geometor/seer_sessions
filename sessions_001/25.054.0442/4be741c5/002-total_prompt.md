**input:**
```

4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 2 2 8 8 8 8

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1024x896 at 0x7AA3AFB37370>

**output:**
```
4 2 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x64 at 0x7AA3AFB7DC90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller grid. The input grid has distinct rectangular regions of color (yellow, red, and azure). The output grid seems to represent a highly simplified version, preserving only one pixel of each color from the input. The spatial arrangement of colors in the output corresponds to the general layout in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      width: 16
      height: 14
      colors: [4, 2, 8]  # Yellow, Red, Azure
      regions:
        - color: 4 #yellow
          shape: rectangle
          top_left: [0,0]
          bottom_right: [13,6]
        - color: 2 #red
          shape: rectangle
          top_left: [0,7]
          bottom_right: [13,13]
        - color: 8 #azure
          shape: rectangle
          top_left: [0,14]
          bottom_right: [13,15]
          
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      width: 3
      height: 1
      colors: [4, 2, 8]
      regions:
        - color: 4
          top_left: [0,0]
        - color: 2
          top_left: [0,1]
        - color: 8
          top_left: [0,2]

actions:
  - type: simplify
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Reduce the input grid to a single row, preserving one pixel of each unique color and their relative horizontal order.

relationships:
  - type: color_correspondence
    description: Each color in the output grid corresponds to a distinct color region in the input grid.
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: the horizontal ordering from left to right of colors is maintained
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Unique Colors:** Determine the distinct colors present in the input grid. In this example, they are yellow (4), red (2), and azure (8).

2. **Maintain Spatial Relationship:** Keep the horizontal order in the output

3. **Reduce to Single Row:** Create an output grid with a height of 1 and a width equal to the number of unique colors.

4. **Represent Each Color:** For each unique color, place a single pixel of that color in the output grid. The order of the colors in the output grid should maintain the encountered order from left to right.

In essence, the transformation extracts one pixel of each unique color from the input grid, arranging them in a single row while preserving original color encountered from left to right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
