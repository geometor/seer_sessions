The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a different color. The transformation appears to be a selection or extraction of a specific region within the input grid, rather than a manipulation of the pixel values themselves. The output grid seems to maintain the relative positions of the pixels from the input grid. The critical challenge is to determine the rule governing which part of the input grid is selected to form the output. The colors used in the input not present in the output are: green, blue, gray, magenta.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
