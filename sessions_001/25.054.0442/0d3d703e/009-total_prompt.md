Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.
2.  Add 4 to the original value of each cell. If new value is greater than 9 then take the modulo 10. Assign the new value to the same position in output grid.
3.  Output will be the result of adding 4 to each cell value.

Effectively, every value in the grid has 4 added to its original value. Modulo 10 is taken if result is greater than 9.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each cell in the grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Add 4 to the original value of the cell and assign the new value to the output grid.
            output_grid[i, j] = (output_grid[i,j] + 4) % 10

    return output_grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
