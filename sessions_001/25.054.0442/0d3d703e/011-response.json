            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of using a lookup table is correct. However, the lookup table itself is incorrect, leading to mismatches in the transformed outputs. The `else keep original value` is unnecessary and confusing. We need to refine the lookup table based on *all* provided examples, not just the first one. The strategy is to identify the correct mapping for each color by comparing input and expected output grids across all examples and modify the lookup table in `transform` function accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input `3` maps to Expected `4`, but Transformed to `7`.\n    *   Input `1` maps to Expected `5`, and Transformed correctly to `5`.\n    *   Input `2` maps to Expected `6`, and Transformed correctly to `6`.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input `2` maps to Expected `6`, and Transformed correctly to `6`.\n    *   Input `3` maps to Expected `4`, but Transformed `7`.\n    *   Input `8` maps to Expected `9`, but Transformed to `2`.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input `5` maps to Expected `1`, but Transformed `9`.\n    *   Input `8` maps to Expected `9`, but Transformed to `2`.\n    *   Input `6` maps to Expected `2`, but Transformed to `0`.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Input `9` maps to Expected `8` , Transformed to `3`\n    *    Input `4` maps to Expected `3`, Transformed to `8`\n    *    Input `2` maps to Expected `6`, Transformed to `6`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 010\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_colors: [3, 1, 2]\n    output_colors: [4, 5, 6]\n    mapping: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6}\n  - id: 2\n    input_colors: [2, 3, 8]\n    output_colors: [6, 4, 9]\n    mapping: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}\n  - id: 3\n    input_colors: [5, 8, 6]\n    output_colors: [1, 9, 2]\n    mapping: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2}\n  - id: 4\n    input_colors: [ 9, 4, 2]\n    output_colors: [ 8, 3, 6]\n    mapping: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Direct Color Mapping:** For each pixel in the input grid, determine its color value.\n2.  **Lookup Transformation:** Use the following lookup table to map the input color to the output color:\n\n    ```\n    1 -> 5\n    2 -> 6\n    3 -> 4\n    4 -> 3\n    5 -> 1\n    6 -> 2\n    8 -> 9\n    9 -> 8\n    ```\n3.  replace the input pixel with the output from the lookup table\n\nThe core concept is a simple color substitution based on a fixed lookup table. There are no spatial reasoning, object detection, or complex operations involved. The transformation is purely a one-to-one mapping of color values.\n"
