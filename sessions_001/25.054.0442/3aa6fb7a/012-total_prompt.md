Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and implemented a prioritization scheme (Above > Left > Below > Right) for placing a blue pixel adjacent to azure clusters. However, the second example reveals a flaw in this strict prioritization. The transformed output places blue pixels incorrectly, and there seems to be interaction across clusters. It seems that checking existence of a neighbor should not mean immediately placing a blue pixel. Instead all neighbors must be checked, across all clusters, then blue placed only if one neighbor exist.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Misplaced Pixels:** Carefully examine where the blue pixels are incorrectly placed in the transformed outputs compared to the expected outputs. This will highlight the limitations of the current prioritization logic.
2.  **Relax Prioritization:** Modify the logic to *not* immediately place a blue pixel based on the first available white neighbor. Instead, consider all adjacent white pixels for each azure cluster and apply a more nuanced rule. The examples suggest a rule based on unique adjacent white pixels
3.  **Inter-cluster interaction:** The placement of a blue in cluster seems to remove the option for placing another blue, even if the cluster has white (0) adjacencies.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the corrected logic, focusing on unique adjacency.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid. Two azure clusters: one 2x1, one 2x2.
    *   Expected Output: A blue pixel is placed to the right of the 2x1 cluster, and to the left of one azure from the 2x2 cluster.
    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Blue pixels placed above the top-left corner of each cluster.
    *   Issues: Strict prioritization (Above > Left > Below > Right) is incorrect and misses expected location.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid. Three azure clusters.
    *   Expected Output: Blue pixels placed according to a one-blue-per-unique-white-neighbor rule.
    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Prioritization error and interaction between clusters.
    *   Issues: Again, prioritization is a problem. Additionally there is interaction across the clusters.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_cluster
    type: cluster
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - adjacent_whites: []  # List of (row, col) tuples

actions:
  - name: find_adjacent_whites
    description: Locates all white (0) pixels adjacent to an azure cluster.
  - name: place_blue_pixel
    description: Places a single blue (1) pixel adjacent to an azure cluster in an empty white (0) cell,
                 only if that white neighbor is unique to the cluster.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Find all contiguous clusters of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Find Adjacent Whites:** For each identified azure cluster, find all adjacent white (0) pixels.
3. **Determine Unique White Neighbors:** From the list of all adjacent white pixels found in step two, if an adjacent white cell is only adjacent to one azure cluster, it is considered "unique."
4.  **Place Blue Pixel:** For each azure cluster, change *one* of the *unique* adjacent white pixels to blue (1). If more than one such cell exists for a single cluster, one is selected, but it must be unique.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
