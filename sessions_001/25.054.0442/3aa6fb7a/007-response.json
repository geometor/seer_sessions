The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels within or adjacent to existing azure (8) clusters.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The placement appears to be one pixel adjacent to isolated clusters, and not full surrounds. Specifically, the single 8 in the input becomes adjacent to a 1.
