Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating colored rectangles within a grid. The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4), red (2), and blue (1). The background is white (0). The transformation appears to involve a rearrangement and potentially a deletion of some of these colored rectangles. Specifically, it seems like the positions and shapes of the rectangles change between the input and output, with some disappearing. The yellow rectangle appears to reduce in height, the red and blue move position and shrink

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: rectangle_1
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position: [9, 1]  # Top-left corner row, col
    initial_shape: [6, 4] # height, width
    final_position: [3, 1]
    final_shape: [6,4]

  - id: rectangle_2
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: [10, 11]
    initial_shape: [5, 2]
    final_position: [5,11]
    final_shape: [4,2]

  - id: rectangle_3
    color: blue (1)
    initial_position: [13, 7]
    initial_shape: [2, 2]
    final_position: [11,7]
    final_shape: [2,2]

actions:
  - type: move
    object: rectangle_1
    parameters: [up, 6 rows ] #row displacement
  - type: move
    object: rectangle_2
    parameters: [up, 5 rows ] #row displacement
  - type: shrink
    object: rectangle_2
    axis: vertical
    amount: 1
  - type: move
    object: rectangle_3
    parameters: [up, 2 rows]
  - type: deletion
    object: some white space around colored blocks, not the entire row/col
    parameters: {}

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: Rectangles are initially separated. After transformation, rectangles are still separated.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Move the yellow rectangle:** Move the top edge of the yellow rectangle up by six rows, keeping its original width.
2.  **Move the red rectangle**: Move the top of the red rectangle up 5 rows. Decrease red rectangle height by 1.
3.  **Move the blue rectangle:** Move the top of the blue rectangle up 2 rows.
4.  **Delete some rows and columns:** Delete white rows above and below colored blocks and shift the remaining blocks upwards

Essentially, the transformation involves moving each colored rectangle upwards and removing some of the empty (white) rows above, within, and below the colored rectangles, compacting the non-zero elements vertically.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
