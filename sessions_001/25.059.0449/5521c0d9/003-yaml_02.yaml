facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains three distinct colored rectangular blocks: blue, red, and yellow.
  - object_1:
      type: rectangle
      color: blue
      initial_position:  bottom-left corner
      initial_dimensions: 3x2 (height x width)
  - object_2:
      type: rectangle
      color: red
      initial_position:  bottom-middle, adjacent to blue
      initial_dimensions: 2x4
  - object_3:
      type: rectangle
      color: yellow
      initial_position: bottom-right, adjacent to red
      initial_dimensions: 4x4
  - transformation_1: |
      The blue block remains in the same relative position but is shifted upwards by 4 rows.
  - transformation_2: |
      The red block shifts upwards such that rows where there is blue are empty, and its position is four rows above its original lower bound.
  - transformation_3: |
      The yellow blocks shifts upwards by four rows.
  - observation_2: |
        The size of objects remains the same, except when shifted in contact with another.
