Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored blocks. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The primary colors involved are blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement and, crucially, a *rotation* or *shifting* of the colored blocks within the grid. Empty spaces (white, 0) seem to play a structural role, possibly defining boundaries or padding. The key action appears to be moving blocks of pixels. It seems like a rotation of colored object.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
    - type: colored_block
      properties:
        - color: [blue, red, yellow]
        - shape: rectangle
        - size: variable
        - position: [row, column]
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: [15, 15]
        - background_color: white

  - actions:
      - type: shift
        properties:
          - description: Objects reposition, maintaining relative positions within their group but the group moves as whole.
          - direction: unknown
          - magnitude: unknown
      - type: rotate_block
        properties:
          - description: Rotate 90 degress counter-clockwise the colored objects, as if they are one combined shape.
          - direction: counter-clockwise
          - angle: 90_degrees
  - relationships:
    - type: spatial
      properties:
        - description: Colored blocks are spatially distinct and do not overlap.
        - adjacency: Blocks of the same color are adjacent, forming rectangular shapes.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Each block is considered a separate object, defined by its color, rectangular shape, and position within the grid.

2.  **Treat as combined shape:** Consider all colored blocks a single object/shape.

3.  **Rotate Counter-Clockwise:** Rotate the entire combined shape by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

4.  **Adjust position:** Shift objects to fit within bounds.

5. **Output New Grid:** Construct new image with the same dimensions, background, and object post-rotation.
