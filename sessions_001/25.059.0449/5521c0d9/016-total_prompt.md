Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are colored pixels arranged in a grid. The colors present are white (0), blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (15x15). Most of the grid is filled with white pixels, with a few colored objects.  It appears some colored objects shift and/or are removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_object
    type: vertical_line
    color: blue
    initial_position: (7, 11-14) # column, row range
    final_position: (7, 7-10)  # column, row range
    action: shift_up

  - name: yellow_object
    type: rectangle
    color: yellow
    initial_position: (12-13, 11-14)
    final_position:  (12-13, 9-12)
    action: shift_up

  - name: red_object
    type: horizontal_line
    color: red
    initial_position: (1-4, 14)
    final_position: (1-4,13)
    action: shift up

  - name: background
    type: grid
    color: white
    initial_state: mostly_white
    final_state: mostly_white
    action: partial_clear # Some white pixels overwrite original colored pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the blue vertical line, the yellow rectangle, and red horizontal line.
2. **Vertical Shift:** Move object upward. The objects maintain same column position but shift the row position up.
3. The blue vertical line shifts up by 4 rows.
4. The yellow rectangle shifts up by 2 rows.
5. The Red horizontal line shift up by 1 row.
6.  **Background Interaction** The background is not simply passive.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
