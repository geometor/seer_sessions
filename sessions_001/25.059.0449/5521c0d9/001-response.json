The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The primary colors involved are blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement and, crucially, a *rotation* or *shifting* of the colored blocks within the grid. Empty spaces (white, 0) seem to play a structural role, possibly defining boundaries or padding. The key action appears to be moving blocks of pixels. It seems like a rotation of colored object.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
