The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), red (2), white (0), and azure (8). There are distinct shapes formed by the green and red pixels. The azure color appears to be introduced in the output. The positions of the green and red shapes seem to influence where the azure color is placed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
