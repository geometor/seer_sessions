Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), green (3), and azure (8). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, with some sections remaining the same and others changing. Specifically, a horizontal line of red (2) pixels remains in the same location, as well as parts of a green (3) shape. The changes are that some green is removed and new row of azure (8) added.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 17x5 (rows x columns)
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      row: 4
      length: 5
  - type: shape
    properties:
     color: green(3)
     location: row 12 col 1
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      row: 8
      length: 5
      
actions:
  - type: preserve
    target: horizontal_line of red(2)
  - type: remove
    target: top three rows of green(3) shape
  - type: move_down
    target: bottom two rows of green(3) shape
  - type: add
    target: horizontal line of color azure(8)

relationships:
  - red line:  constant position between input and output.
  - azure line: appears below the red line.
  - green shape: adjacent to red line, part is removed
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve the Red Line:** The horizontal line of red (2) pixels in the input grid is preserved in the output grid at the same location.

2.  **Partially remove and shift the Green Shape:**
    -Remove the the first three rows of the original green shape.
    -The remaining two rows are shifted upward to immediately follow the red(2) line.

3.  **Add Azure Line:** A new horizontal line of azure (8) pixels is added to the output grid. This new line is positioned four rows below the shifted green shape (or 8 rows below the red line).

4. **Clear other:** set value of other cells to white/0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
