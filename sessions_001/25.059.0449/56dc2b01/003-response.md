Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating colored grids. The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), red (2), white (0), and azure (8). There are distinct shapes formed by the green and red pixels. The azure color appears to be introduced in the output. The positions of the green and red shapes seem to influence where the azure color is placed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_shape
    type: contiguous_block
    color: green
    initial_position: variable
  - name: red_shape
    type: contiguous_block
    color: red
    initial_position: variable
  - name: azure_column
    type: vertical_line
    color: azure
    position: derived

actions:
  - name: insert_azure
    type: add_object
    object: azure_column
    condition: relative_to green_and_red

relationships:
  - object1: green_shape
    object2: red_shape
    relation: spatial_proximity
  - object1: azure_column
    object2: green_shape, red_shape
    relation: positioning_rule
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous block of green (3) pixels and the contiguous block of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Determine Azure Column Position:** Find the x-coordinate that is two positions to the left of the leftmost edge of the red shape.
3.  **Insert Azure Column:** Create a vertical column of azure (8) pixels at the determined x-coordinate. The height of this column matches the height of the input grid. All cells in this column become azure.
4. The other digits remain in their respective positions.

Essentially, a vertical azure line is inserted two columns to the left of the red shape.
