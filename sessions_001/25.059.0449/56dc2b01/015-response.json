Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), green (3), and azure (8). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, with some sections remaining the same and others changing. Specifically, a horizontal line of red (2) pixels remains in the same location, as well as parts of a green (3) shape. The changes are that some green is removed and new row of azure (8) added.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
