Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels.
2.  **Determine Azure Column Position:** For the *leftmost* red block, find the x-coordinate that is two positions to the left of its leftmost edge.
3. **Conditional Azure Insertion**:
    * If the calculated x-coordinate is greater than or equal to 0 (i.e., within the grid boundaries), insert a vertical column of azure (8) pixels at that x-coordinate. The height of this column matches the height of the input grid.
   * If the calculated x-coordinate is less than 0, *do not modify the input grid*.
4. All other pixels remain in their original positions and retain their colors.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single training example, which led to an oversimplified rule. The code correctly identifies red objects and attempts to insert an azure column two positions to the left. However, it fails to generalize to cases where the red object isn't the *leftmost*, where multiple red objects, and when insertion at an `x` value of `-2` is impossible. The core issue is that the initial program was too specific and did not account for variations in the input grids present in other training examples. The strategy to resolve this is to re-examine *all* training examples, derive a more general rule that considers the relative positioning of the red objects and grid boundaries, and create precise insertion rules.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the transformations, I'll leverage `code_execution` where applicable. I will manually inspect the behavior on all the input/output grids of the training set to report here.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: Single red object. Azure column inserted two positions to the left.
    *   Output: Matches expected output.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: Red object is in the leftmost column,
        *   there is a gray object on the rightmost column.
    *   Expected Output: Unchanged input.
    *   Actual Output: the program *did not* alter the grid.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: Two red objects, one on the left and right edge, respectively.
    *   Expected Output: Unchanged input.
    *   Actual Output: the program *did not* alter the grid.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_objects:
    - color: red
      type: object
      leftmost_x: 2
  actions:
    - type: insert_column
      color: azure
      x_coordinate: 0
  output_objects:
    - color: red
      type: object
    - color: azure
      type: column
      x_coordinate: 0

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - color: red
      type: object
      leftmost_x: 0
    - color: grey
      type: object
      leftmost_x: 7

  actions: [] # no actions performed
  output_objects:
      - color: red
        type: object
        leftmost_x: 0
      - color: grey
        type: object
        leftmost_x: 7

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - color: red
      type: object
      leftmost_x: 0
    - color: red
      type: object
      leftmost_x: 7
  actions: [] # No actions performed
  output_objects:
      - color: red
        type: object
        leftmost_x: 0
      - color: red
        type: object
        leftmost_x: 7

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Insertion Point:**
    *   Calculate an x-coordinate two positions to the left of the leftmost edge of the *leftmost* red object.
3.  **Conditional Column Insertion:**
    *   If the calculated x-coordinate is greater than or equal to 0, insert a vertical column of azure (8) pixels at that position. The height of the column should match the height of the input grid.
    *   If the calculated x-coordinate is less than 0, do *not* modify the input grid.
4.  All other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
