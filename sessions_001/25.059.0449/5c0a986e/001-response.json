There are two colors observed: blue (1) and red (2). The background is white (0).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The squares are positioned within a 10x10 grid. They don't overlap.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve a \"trace\" or \"marking\" of the original positions of the blue squares, while extending red squares. A diagonal pattern seems to be emerging.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
