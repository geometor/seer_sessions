Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the two 2x2 squares in the input grid. One is red (top-left) and the other is blue (bottom-right).

2.  **Diagonal Filling:** Create a diagonal path of cells connecting the bottom-right corner of the red square to the top-left corner of the blue square.

3.  **Alternating Colors:** Fill in the cells, including existing square edges, of this diagonal path with alternating colors, starting with blue (1) in the cell to the immediate bottom left of the red square, followed by a zero, and so forth. Include pixels of the original squares.

4. **Preserve remaining Red:** Any remaining red color on the red square remain in the same relative positions.
5. **Preserve remaining Blue:** Any remaining blue color on the blue square remain in the same relative positions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
