Here, we see 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 2 (red).\n*   There are two distinct 2x2 squares in the input, one blue and one red.\n*   In the output, the blue square's pixels appear to have moved individually, now forming a diagonal line, and the red square appears in different locations, and also seems to have an additional element, with color 2, to it's right, and its bottom.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Move each of them independently. Place the first blue pixel in the top left of output, and move diagonally down and to the left, one pixel at a time, placing each of the blue pixels.\n3.  **Process Red Square:** keep the red pixels in their original relative position, however, move the whole square formation of red, to start in the most right column.
