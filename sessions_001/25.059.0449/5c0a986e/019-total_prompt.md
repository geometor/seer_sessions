Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the 2x2 blue square (color 1) and the 2x2 red square (color 2) within the input grid.

2.  **Process Blue Square:**
    *   Disassemble the 2x2 blue square into four individual blue pixels.
    *   Place the first blue pixel in the first column (column 0) of the same row where the blue square started.
    *   Place the remaining three blue pixels diagonally, one pixel down and one pixel to the right for each subsequent pixel.

3.  **Process Red Square:**
    *    Move the red square to the last two columns of the grid, aligned to the same starting row.
    *   Find the row of the input grid that corresponds to a y-offset of +3 from the original red square location and put a red pixel in the last column. Do the same for +4.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
