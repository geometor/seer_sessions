The transformation seems to involve a combination of identifying specific color patterns and modifying/replicating pixels adjacent to them, creating a kind of \"cross\" shape. The central line of this cross seems to influence surrounding pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This can be either vertical or horizontal. Consider lines of length one.\n2. **Determine Intersection:** If the center line intersects another horizontal or vertical center line, find the intersection point.\n3. **Determine the \"Replacement Color\":**\n    * Inspect the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the \"Center Line\".\n    * If all non-zero neighbors adjacent to the center line share a common color (different from the center line), that becomes the \"replacement color\".\n    * In some examples, the replacement color does not match the color of the center line, but is yellow (4).\n4. **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Create a \"cross\" pattern around the central line.\n        *   If there is a vertical center line, paint a horizontal line of the replacement color through any point on the vertical line.\n        *   If there is a horizontal center line, paint a vertical line of the replacement color through any point on the horizontal line.\n    *   Keep the \"Center Line\" pixels unchanged in the output grid.\n    *   All other pixels, except where the cross is formed, remain unchanged from the input grid.\n\n**Observations and Uncertainties:**\n\n-The rules for determining replacement color (yellow=4) appear consistent across all three pairs.\n-It may be that any single pixel \"center line\" gets a cross of yellow=4 surrounding.\n\n"
