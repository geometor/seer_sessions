Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, focusing on the adjacency of blue pixels and changing the color of specific neighboring pixels. However, the provided results will help highlight any errors or omissions from the provided program. The execution did what was asked, and correctly transformed when white and maroon pixels were next to blue. Other colors were left alone.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully compare the input, expected output, and actual output for each training example.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Pinpoint where the actual output differs from the expected output.
3.  **Analyze the Cause:** Determine *why* the code produced an incorrect result. This might involve revisiting the assumptions, boundary conditions, or overlooked aspects of the transformation.
4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Modify the natural language description to accurately capture the observed transformation rule, incorporating the new insights.
5. **Document in YAML and a natural language program:** Structure observations in a report.

**Metrics and Observations**

To gather metrics, I will examine the shape and color of objects. I'll check the output against the expected output, and report on the difference.

Here are the metrics for each example.

**Example 1**

*   **Input Grid:** 7x7
*    Objects
    *   Blue square (1) at center
    *   Maroon and white surrounding the center
*   **Expected Output Grid:** 7x7
*    Objects
    *    Blue square at center
    *    Yellow square surrounding the center
    *   Outermost layer is unchanged
*   **Actual Output Grid:** 7x7
*    Objects
    *    Blue square at center
    *    Yellow square surrounding the center
    *   Outermost layer is unchanged
*    Result
    *    Matches the expected output

**Example 2**

*   **Input Grid:** 9x9

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** the blue (1) square object in the input grid, located at the center.
2.  **Locate** all pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right - not diagonally) to the blue square.
3.  **Change** the color of adjacent pixels that are white (0) to yellow (4).
4. **Preserve** the color of the blue pixels.
5. **Preserve** all other pixels, including the outermost layer of the grid.
6.  **Output** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
