The primary colors involved are white (0), magenta (6), azure (8), and yellow (4).  The transformation seems to focus around the magenta (6) vertical line and a horizontal azure (8) line. A new shape with color yellow(4) appears in the area surrounding the intersection.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A 3x3 box of yellow (4) pixels, is created. Parts of the original azure line is replace by this box.\n\nIn essence the transformation draws a yellow square which is centered on the intersection of the magenta and azure lines.\n"
