**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids with single-digit integer values (0-9) representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a combination of identifying specific color patterns and modifying/replicating pixels adjacent to them, creating a kind of "cross" shape. The central line of this cross seems to influence surrounding pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9)

  - object: color_pattern
    description: A vertical or horizontal line of a single non-zero color
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - orientation: vertical or horizontal
      - length: integer >= 1
      - location: row and column indices

  - action: extend_pattern
    description: Replaces adjacent pixels with a new color, forming a cross
    parameters:
      - source_color: The color of the original line
      - replacement_color:  The new color of extended cross arms
      - center_line : x, y index of center of pattern

  - observation: output_grid
      description: Contains elements from input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the "Center Line":**  Find the longest, straight, contiguous line of a single, non-zero color in the input grid. This can be either vertical or horizontal. Consider lines of length one.
2. **Determine Intersection:** If the center line intersects another horizontal or vertical center line, find the intersection point.
3. **Determine the "Replacement Color":**
    * Inspect the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the "Center Line".
    * If all non-zero neighbors adjacent to the center line share a common color (different from the center line), that becomes the "replacement color".
    * In some examples, the replacement color does not match the color of the center line, but is yellow (4).
4. **Apply Transformation:**
    *   Create a "cross" pattern around the central line.
        *   If there is a vertical center line, paint a horizontal line of the replacement color through any point on the vertical line.
        *   If there is a horizontal center line, paint a vertical line of the replacement color through any point on the horizontal line.
    *   Keep the "Center Line" pixels unchanged in the output grid.
    *   All other pixels, except where the cross is formed, remain unchanged from the input grid.

**Observations and Uncertainties:**

-The rules for determining replacement color (yellow=4) appear consistent across all three pairs.
-It may be that any single pixel "center line" gets a cross of yellow=4 surrounding.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
