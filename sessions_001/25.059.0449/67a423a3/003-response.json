The input grid appears to be transformed into a different output grid. The transformation doesn't seem to involve a simple mirroring, rotation, or overall color shift.  Instead, local changes, possibly based on neighboring pixels, are likely. Specifically, I notice the green (3) pixels in the input do not seem to change in the output. The red (2) pixels maintain their value. Some of the white pixels have been replaced by yellow.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For each white pixel:\n    * Check if the pixel directly above is Green.\n    * Check if the pixel directly below is Green\n    * Check if any of the pixels directly adjacent (above, below, left or right) are Yellow.\n    * If *none* of the above is true, change the pixel to yellow.\n4.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the final output.\n\nIn essence, White pixels become Yellow unless there is a green pixel above\nor below or a yellow pixel to the sides.\n"
