**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to extract and rearrange specific colored objects within the input grid to produce a smaller output grid. The background color is consistently 0 (white) in the inputs and seems to be irrelevant to the transformation. The output grids consist of the non-zero colored pixels from the input, rearranged. The arrangement seems to follow a specific, consistent re-ordering.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - role: input or output
  - type: colored_object
    properties:
      - color: integer (1-9)
      - shape: contiguous block of same-colored pixels
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

actions:
  - name: extract
    description: Identify and isolate colored objects from the input grid.
  - name: rearrange
    description: Reorder the extracted objects into a specific configuration.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Objects are adjacent or non-adjacent.
  - type: containment
    description:  Input grid contains multiple colored objects.
  - type: transformation
      description: output grid is formed of the same colored objects found in the input grid, but the white (0) background is discarded

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) pixels. Each such block constitutes a distinct "colored object."

2.  **Extract Objects:** Extract each identified colored object. Note their color (numerical value) and their shape (though shape seems to be discarded in the final output, only the order of colors, vertically and then horizontally).

3.  **Arrange in Output:** Take the first non zero color on the first row, add it to the output grid. Move to the next non zero color and add that to the output grid, continue for the whole first row. Then perform the same operation with the next rows.

4. **Output**: return the resulting smaller grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
