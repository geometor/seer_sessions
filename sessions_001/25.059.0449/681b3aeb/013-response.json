The input grid contains two distinct colored objects: a green (3) object and a blue (1) object, against a background of white (0) cells. The output grid appears to be a smaller, condensed representation, combining information from both objects in the input. Specifically, it seems to represent the relative positions and colors of the objects.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Use its colors to populate the top row.\n5. **Populate Middle Row:**  Find intersection of bounding boxes on y axis.\n6. **Populate Bottom Row:** Check bounding box for object with the greatest Y values.
