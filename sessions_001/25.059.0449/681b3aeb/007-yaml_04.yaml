  - action: extract_regions
    description: The colored regions (magenta and yellow) are extracted from the input grid.
  - action: rearrange_regions
    description: The extracted regions are placed in a new, smaller grid, maintaining some relative positioning.
  - relationship: spatial
    description: The relative positions of the yellow and magenta regions in the output grid somewhat correspond to their positions in the input, although scaled and without empty space.
