The grids contain numerical values representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve selecting specific colored regions from the input and rearranging them in the output. Specifically, I see two distinct colored regions in the input: magenta (6) and yellow (4). The output grid appears to be a condensed representation of these colored regions, preserving their relative positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In this specific example, identify the magenta (6) and yellow (4) regions.\n2.  **Extract Regions:**  Conceptually \"cut out\" these identified regions from the input grid.\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Determine the size of the output grid based on the bounding box that combines the extracted colored blocks.\n4.  **Place Regions:** Position the extracted regions within the new output grid. The relative positions of the objects from each other must be the same. Preserve the shape and size of the regions as much as allows. Empty (0 color value) space between them in the input should be removed.\n\nIn short we could say: Extract all the colored blocks from the grid and move them as close together as possible in the top-left of a new grid, preserving the relative positions.\n"
