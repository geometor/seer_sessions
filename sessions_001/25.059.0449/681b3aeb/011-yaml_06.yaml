- observation:
    description: "The transformation preserves the input grid if the bounding box of non-black objects equals the input grid dimensions. Otherwise, a bounding box equal to all objects is created, removing additional rows or columns of only zeros"
    examples: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- object_definition:
    description: "An object is a contiguous region of pixels with the same non-black color."
    examples: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- bounding_box:
    description: "A rectangle enclosing all objects defined by min and max row and column."
    examples: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

- action: copy_input
  condition: "bounding box height and width == input grid height and width"
  result: output grid is identical to input grid
  examples: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
- action: copy_objects
  condition: "bounding box height and width != input grid height and width"
  result: create a new grid sized to fit only the objects, copy the object to the new grid, maintaining position relative to the top-left.
  examples: [ 5 ]
