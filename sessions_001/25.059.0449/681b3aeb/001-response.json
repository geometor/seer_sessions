The transformation seems to extract and rearrange specific colored objects within the input grid to produce a smaller output grid. The background color is consistently 0 (white) in the inputs and seems to be irrelevant to the transformation. The output grids consist of the non-zero colored pixels from the input, rearranged. The arrangement seems to follow a specific, consistent re-ordering.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Note their color (numerical value) and their shape (though shape seems to be discarded in the final output, only the order of colors, vertically and then horizontally).\n\n3.  **Arrange in Output:** Take the first non zero color on the first row, add it to the output grid. Move to the next non zero color and add that to the output grid, continue for the whole first row. Then perform the same operation with the next rows.\n\n4. **Output**: return the resulting smaller grid.\n"
