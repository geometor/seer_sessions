Contiguous means pixels that are connected horizontally or vertically.\n\n2. Identify Enclosed Shapes: Within the bounding box of the largest yellow shape, identify any shapes that are completely enclosed by the yellow shape. A shape is considered enclosed if all of its pixels are surrounded by yellow pixels of the largest yellow shape, either directly or through a chain of adjacent yellow pixels.\n\n3. Fill Enclosed Shapes: Any shapes enclosed in the largest yellow shape are entirely filled with the color of the enclosing shape (yellow).\n\n4. Extract Combined Shape: Create a new output grid. Copy the largest yellow shape and any enclosed, filled shapes from the input grid to the output grid. The output should be tightly bounded: create the smallest possible rectangle including the largest yellow object and any enclosed objects.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_shapes(grid):\n    # Find all contiguous shapes in a grid\n    shapes = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, shape_color, current_shape):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r, c] != shape_color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_shape.append((r, c))\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, shape_color, current_shape)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited:\n                shape_color = grid[r, c]\n                if shape_color != 0: # don't care about blank\n                   current_shape = []\n                   dfs(r, c, shape_color, current_shape)\n                   shapes.append((shape_color, current_shape))\n    return shapes\n\ndef find_largest_shape(shapes):\n    # Find the largest shape in a list of shapes\n    largest_shape = []\n    max_size = 0\n    for color, shape in shapes:\n        size = len(shape)\n        if size > max_size:\n            max_size = size\n            largest_shape = shape\n    return largest_shape\n\ndef flood_fill(grid, start_r, start_c, fill_color):\n    \"\"\"Fills a region in the grid with the given color.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    original_color = grid[start_r, start_c]\n    if original_color == fill_color:\n        return\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    queue = [(start_r, start_c)]\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add((start_r,start_c))\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.pop(0)\n        grid[r, c] = fill_color\n\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if is_valid(nr, nc) and grid[nr, nc] == original_color and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n                visited.add((nr,nc))\n\n\n\ndef extract_shape_and_enclosed(input_grid, shape_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Extracts a shape and any enclosed shapes, filling enclosed regions.\"\"\"\n    if not shape_pixels:\n        return np.zeros((1, 1), dtype=int)\n\n    min_r = min(r for r, c in shape_pixels)\n    max_r = max(r for r, c in shape_pixels)\n    min_c = min(c for r, c in shape_pixels)\n    max_c = max(c for r, c in shape_pixels)\n\n    # Create a new grid for the bounding box\n    rows = max_r - min_r + 1\n    cols = max_c - min_c + 1\n    extracted_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n\n    # Copy the main shape pixels\n    for r, c in shape_pixels:\n        extracted_grid[r - min_r, c - min_c] = input_grid[r, c]\n\n    # Find enclosed regions and flood fill\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if extracted_grid[r, c] == 0:  # Check for potential enclosed regions\n                is_enclosed = True\n                for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    if not (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and extracted_grid[nr,nc] != 0):\n                        is_enclosed = False\n                        break\n\n                if is_enclosed:\n                    # determine color to use\n                    fill_color = 4\n                    flood_fill(extracted_grid, r, c, fill_color)\n\n    return extracted_grid\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Find all shapes in the input grid\n    shapes = find_shapes(input_grid)\n\n    # Find yellow shapes\n    yellow_shapes = [shape for color, shape in shapes if color == 4]\n\n    # Find the largest yellow shape\n    largest_yellow_shape = find_largest_shape(yellow_shapes)\n\n    # Extract the largest yellow shape and fill enclosed regions\n    output_grid = extract_shape_and_enclosed(input_grid, largest_yellow_shape)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
