"""
1. Identify Green Objects: Examine the input grid and identify all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of green (color 3) pixels.  Two green pixels are part of the same object if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.
2. Iterate and Copy: For *each* identified green object:
    a. Find the bounding box: determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices that enclose the object.
    b. Extract the object: Create a new grid containing a copy of the green object from the original input using the calculated bounding box to select a sub-grid with the object.
    c. Place into output: create the output by placing the copied object, maintaining shape.
3. Output: The final output is the result of copying all green objects.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focused on extracting green objects and placing the *first* one into the output. This approach works for the first training example, but it clearly fails to handle cases with multiple green objects or scenarios requiring different object selection or arrangement.  The core issue is that the current program isn't general enough to handle any input other than the first training set example.

Here's the breakdown of the strategy to address the issues:
1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs in the training set, focusing on the relationships between the green objects and the final output. Pay close attention to object counts, shapes, relative positions.
2.  **Metrics and Error Reports**: Use code execution to produce reports.
3.  **Refine Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function seems correct, so no change is needed.
4.  **Revise Object Handling:** The main problem is with how extracted green objects are put into the `output_grid`. The current logic only keeps the first identified object. We need to revise how to combine the objects to form a final output.
5.  **Develop a More General Rule:** Based on the observations, formulate a new natural language program that accounts for the variations seen across all training examples.

**Metrics and Error Reports**

To better understand the errors, let's create and execute a script to provide metrics about the examples and compare the code output to the expected output.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: green
          shape: vertical line
          count: 1
      output_objects:
        - color: green
          shape: vertical line (same as input)
          transformation:  The green object is moved to the top left.
  - example_2:

    output_objects:
      - color: green
        shape:  horizontal line (same as input)

      - color: green
        shape: square
        count: 1
    output_objects:
      - color: green
        shape: square (same as input)
        transformation: The green object is moved to the top left.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous regions (objects) of green pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract and Position:** Extract each identified green object and move it to the top-left corner of the output grid, *without changing the size or orientation*.  If there are no green objects, return a blank grid. If the green object takes up more than the top-left corner, keep it in place.

This program is now more concise and accurately captures the observed transformation rule. It highlights the core operation: green objects are extracted and repositioned (or left in place if it is already taking up the top-left).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
