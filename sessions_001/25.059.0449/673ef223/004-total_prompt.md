Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve some form of replication or expansion of existing colored areas, along with the introduction of new colors.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input grid contains a vertical red line on the left and a vertical red line on the right."
  - observation: "There is an isolated azure pixel in the input grid near the center of first red line."
  - observation: "The output grid retains the red lines' general positions."
  - observation: "The isolated azure pixel in the input expands horizontally to three of the red line's pixel to the left and becomes part of new red line."
  - observation: "A new yellow pixel appears to the right of the expanded azure region."
  - observation: "The right red vertical line also have 6 azure pixels to the left edge"
  - subject: "Red vertical lines"
    action: "Maintain vertical structure"
    relation: "Position is relatively unchanged"
  - subject: "Azure pixel"
    action: "Expands horizontally"
    relation: "Adjacent to original position and red line"
  - subject: "Yellow pixel"
    action: "Appears"
    relation: "Adjacent to the expanded azure region"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the two vertical red lines (value 2) on the left and right edges and the isolated azure pixel (value 8).

2.  **Left Red line transformation**: The azure pixel on the left line extends three pixels to the left.

3. **Introduce New Color:** A yellow pixel(4) appears immediately to the right of the expanded azure region of the left red line.

4. **Right red line transformation**: Add six pixels azure to the left to make it eight pixels wide.

5.  **Preserve Red Lines:** Maintain the two original vertical red lines in their respective starting and ending columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
