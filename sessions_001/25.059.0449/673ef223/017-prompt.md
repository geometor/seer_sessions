Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Lines:** Locate all contiguous horizontal and vertical lines of red (2) pixels. These act as boundaries.
2.  **Identify initial Azure Pixels:** Find all azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Fill within boundaries**: identify areas bound by the red lines, and expand the azure (8) pixels to fill any contiguous white (0) areas.
4.  **Introduce Yellow:** Where azure pixels were located in the input grid, replace with yellow (4) in the output grid.
5.  **Preserve Red:** The red lines (2) remain unchanged.
6.  **Background Remains:** All other white (0) areas not next to existing azure areas remain.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
