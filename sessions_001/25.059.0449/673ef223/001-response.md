Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors (represented by integers 0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct "objects" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The most prominent change is the appearance of azure (8) and yellow (4) regions in the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
    - name: red_column_left
      color: red (2)
      shape: vertical line/column
      location: left side of grid
      properties:
        - static: false # Changes in the output
    - name: red_column_right
      color: red (2)
      shape: vertical line/column
      location: right side of the grid
      properties:
        - static: false
    - name: azure_shapes
      color: azure (8)
      shape: variable, horizontal lines/smudges
      location: between red columns, variable rows
      properties:
        - static: true #Present in input
    - name: transformed_azure
      color: azure(8)
      shape: horizontal line
      location: between red lines
      properties:
          - appears: output
    - name: yellow_pixel
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: single pixel
      location: variable, near azure shapes
      properties:
        - appears: output

  - actions:
    - name: fill_between
      description: Azure (8) pixels fill the horizontal space between red columns, starting from where existing azure is.
    - name: create_yellow
      description: A single yellow (4) pixel appears to the left of the azure fill, one column away, or multiple azure colored blocks are converted to yellow on left

  - relationships:
    - red_columns_left_and_right: "define the horizontal boundaries for azure fill"
    - azure_shapes: "serve as a starting point for horizontal azure fill"
    - yellow_pixel: "appears adjacent to the filled azure region"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Locate the vertical red (2) columns on the left and right sides of the grid.

2.  **Horizontal Fill:**
    *   Identify exist azure (8) shape
    *   For each row containing azure pixels, extend those azure pixels horizontally to the left until it meets either a red column or the edge of the grid.
    *   Extend those azure shapes horizontally to the right, changing the color of pixels one by one from white(0) to azure (8) until a red(2) pixel is encountered or edge of the grid.

3.  **Yellow Insertion:**
    *   Find the leftmost azure(8) pixel.
    *    Change the color of pixel at one column to left to Yellow(4), unless azure extends to edge of input, then transform the leftmost azure pixels until a single yellow is present

This program describes a process of bounded horizontal filling and a single yellow pixel insertion based on proximity to the filled area.
