Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Find all contiguous horizontal and vertical lines of red (2) pixels. These constitute the boundaries.
2.  **Locate Initial Azure:** Identify all pixels that are initially colored azure (8).
3.  **Expand Azure:** For each azure pixel, perform a flood fill operation:
    *   Change contiguous white (0) pixels to azure (8).
    *   Stop the flood fill when encountering a red (2) pixel or any color other than white.
4.  **Replace Initial Azure:** After the expansion, change all pixels that were *originally* azure (8) (i.e., before the expansion) to yellow (4).
5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not white (0) or part of the original azure (8) regions remain in their original colors, including the red boundaries.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, correctly identifying the core concept of expanding azure regions and replacing the original azure pixels with yellow. However, the flood fill implementation has a critical flaw related to diagonal expansion. The current flood fill only considers up, down, left, and right neighbors.  It needs to include diagonal neighbors. Additionally, the concept of "boundary" needs to be refined. The flood fill should stop at *any* non-white pixel, not just red ones.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Flood Fill:** Modify the `flood_fill` function to include diagonal neighbors (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast).
2.  **Generalized Boundary:**  Refine the natural language and code to specify that the flood fill stops at *any* non-white pixel. The current code already does this, so only the natural language program will change here.
3.  **Verify Logic:** After correcting the flood fill, re-evaluate the natural language program to ensure it accurately describes the observed behavior.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To gather detailed metrics, I will use a helper function to execute code and provide feedback. I will analyze each example's input, output, and result, reporting:

*   **Initial Azure Pixels:** Count and location.
*   **Expected Azure Pixels (Post-Expansion):**  Count and location in the expected output.
*   **Result Azure Pixels (Post-Expansion):** Count and location in the code's result.
*   **Initial Yellow Pixels:** Should be none in input, verify.
*    **Expected Yellow Pixels:** Count, location in output (should match original azure).
*   **Result Yellow Pixels**: Count and location.
*   **Mismatched Pixels:** Count, location and expected/result values of any pixels that differ between expected output and result.

```python
def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """Compares two grids and returns a list of mismatched pixels."""
    mismatches = []
    rows, cols = grid1.shape
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid1[r, c] != grid2[r, c]:
                mismatches.append(((r, c), grid1[r, c], grid2[r, c]))
    return mismatches

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, result_grid):
    """Analyzes an example and returns a dictionary of metrics."""
    analysis = {}

    # Initial Azure
    initial_azure = find_pixels(input_grid, 8)
    analysis['initial_azure_count'] = len(initial_azure)
    analysis['initial_azure_loc'] = initial_azure

    # Expected Azure
    expected_azure = find_pixels(output_grid, 8)
    analysis['expected_azure_count'] = len(expected_azure)
    analysis['expected_azure_loc'] = expected_azure

    # Result Azure
    result_azure = find_pixels(result_grid, 8)
    analysis['result_azure_count'] = len(result_azure)
    analysis['result_azure_loc'] = result_azure

    # Initial Yellow
    initial_yellow = find_pixels(input_grid, 4)
    analysis['initial_yellow_count'] = len(initial_yellow)
    analysis['initial_yellow_loc'] = initial_yellow

    # Expected Yellow
    expected_yellow = find_pixels(output_grid, 4)
    analysis['expected_yellow_count'] = len(expected_yellow)
    analysis['expected_yellow_loc'] = expected_yellow
    
    # Result Yellow
    result_yellow = find_pixels(result_grid, 4)
    analysis['result_yellow_count'] = len(result_yellow)
    analysis['result_yellow_loc'] = result_yellow
    

    # Mismatches
    mismatches = compare_grids(output_grid, result_grid)
    analysis['mismatched_count'] = len(mismatches)
    analysis['mismatched_pixels'] = mismatches

    return analysis

# Example usage (assuming input_grid, output_grid, and result_grid are defined)
# analysis = analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, result_grid)
# print(analysis)
```

I will now use the above functions to get detailed analysis of each training example and use that for informing updated yaml and natural language program.

**YAML Facts:**
```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - rows
      - columns
      - cells (pixels)
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color
      - row_index
      - column_index
  - name: azure_region
    properties:
      - initial_pixels # Pixels that are azure at the start.
      - expanded_pixels # Pixels after flood fill.
    actions:
      - flood_fill: "Expands from an initial pixel to adjacent white pixels, stopping at any non-white pixel."
  - name: yellow_region
    properties:
      - replaced_pixels
    actions:
       - replace: "replaces initial azure pixels with yellow color"

colors:
  - white: 0
  - blue: 1
  - red: 2
  - green: 3
  - yellow: 4
  - gray: 5
  - magenta: 6
  - orange: 7
  - azure: 8
  - maroon: 9

transformations:
  - step_1: "Identify initial azure pixels."
  - step_2: "Expand each initial azure pixel using flood fill, changing contiguous white pixels to azure. Stop at any non-white pixel."
  - step_3: "Change all initial azure pixels to yellow."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Initial Azure:** Locate all pixels that are initially colored azure (8). These are the starting points for expansion.
2.  **Expand Azure (Flood Fill):** For each initially azure pixel, perform a flood fill operation:
    *   Change contiguous white (0) pixels to azure (8), including diagonally adjacent pixels.
    *   Stop the flood fill when encountering *any* non-white pixel (1-9).
3.  **Replace with Yellow:** After the expansion, change all pixels that were *originally* azure (8) (before the expansion) to yellow (4).
4. **Preserve:** All non-white pixels retain their orginal colors.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
