Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Lines:** Locate all contiguous horizontal and vertical lines of red (2) pixels. These act as boundaries.
2.  **Identify initial Azure Pixels:** Find all azure (8) pixels.
3.  **Fill within boundaries**: identify areas bound by the red lines, and expand the azure (8) pixels to fill any contiguous white (0) areas.
4.  **Introduce Yellow:** Where azure pixels were located in the input grid, replace with yellow (4) in the output grid.
5.  **Preserve Red:** The red lines (2) remain unchanged.
6.  **Background Remains:** All other white (0) areas not next to existing azure areas remain.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of expanding azure within red boundaries and replacing the original azure with yellow. However, the test results reveal some discrepancies. The core issue seems to be in how the flood fill is behaving and interacting with pre-existing colors and complex shapes. The flood fill may be filling unintended areas.

My strategy to resolve these issues is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll meticulously examine each input/output/predicted output triplet. I'll focus on *where* the prediction deviates from the expected output. This will pinpoint the specific scenarios where the current logic fails.
2.  **Refine Flood Fill Conditions:**  I'll use code execution to develop an error matrix that compares the output grid and the predicted grid to show exactly what is wrong. I'll analyze to see if the flood fill needs additional stopping conditions, or if the initial seeding of the flood fill is incorrect.
3.  **Object Identification:** If the errors aren't solely related to flood fill, I will re-examine the core assumptions about objects and boundaries, and ensure that my definition of contiguous regions and boundaries is completely accurate.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** I'll update the natural language program and, subsequently, the code, based on the refined understanding of the transformation rules. I will retest against *all* examples after each code change.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To gain precise insights, I need to perform a detailed comparison of expected and predicted outputs, which will help me understand exactly where and how the code is failing.

I don't have the capability to directly execute code. I will simulate it to show the kind of information I am trying to collect.
I'm particularly interested in:

*   **Mismatched Pixels:** The exact locations (row, column) and colors of pixels that differ between the predicted and expected outputs.
*   **Unexpected Fills:** Regions where the flood fill extended beyond the intended boundaries or filled areas it shouldn't have.
*   **Missed Fills:** Regions where the flood fill should have occurred but didn't.

```
# SIMULATED CODE EXECUTION AND REPORT

# This is a *simulation* of what I would do if I had code execution.
# I'm creating representative data based on what I expect to see given
# the descriptions and images.

example_results = []

# example data is in the form of a list of (input, expected output, predicted output) tuples
for example_num in range(len(example_data)): #assuming this is a list loaded previously
    input_grid = example_data[example_num][0]
    expected_grid = example_data[example_num][1]
    predicted_grid = transform(input_grid)

    diff_grid = (expected_grid != predicted_grid).astype(int)
    mismatched_pixels = np.sum(diff_grid)
    mismatched_locations = np.where(diff_grid)
    
    metrics = {
        "example": example_num + 1,
        "mismatched_pixels": mismatched_pixels,
        "mismatched_locations": list(zip(mismatched_locations[0], mismatched_locations[1])),
        "error_summary": ""  # Placeholder for a categorized error summary
    }
    example_results.append(metrics)
    
# Analyze the example metrics for patterns
total_mismatches = 0
for result in example_results:
      total_mismatches += result['mismatched_pixels']
      if len(result['mismatched_locations']) > 0:
        print(f"example {result['example']} had {result['mismatched_pixels']} errors")
        # the following is not real - I cannot derive this
        # for loc in result['mismatched_locations']:
        #     print(f"  error at {loc}: expected: {expected_grid[loc]}, predicted: {predicted_grid[loc]}")

print(f"total errors in set: {total_mismatches}")
```

Based on a manual visual inspection (since I can't execute the code), I'll provide an interpretation of the *simulated* results and what I *hypothesize* are the error patterns:

*   **Example 1:** (Assuming the provided code works perfectly on the first example, as stated). `mismatched_pixels` would be 0.
*   **Example 2:** The azure seems to correctly expand horizontally, but does not expand across the red lines.
*   **Example 3:** The azure should expand into the diagonal and horizontal, but does not.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_lines
    type: boundary
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: horizontal and vertical lines
      behavior: "limits expansion of azure"
  - name: azure_regions
    type: fillable_area
    properties:
      initial_color: azure (8)
      expanded_color: azure (8)
      replaced_color: yellow (4)
      behavior: "expands within red_lines to fill white areas"
  - name: white_regions
    type: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      behavior: "filled by expanding azure if adjacent, otherwise remains unchanged"
```

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Find all contiguous horizontal and vertical lines of red (2) pixels. These constitute the boundaries.
2.  **Locate Initial Azure:** Identify all pixels that are initially colored azure (8).
3.  **Expand Azure:** For each azure pixel, perform a flood fill operation:
    *   Change contiguous white (0) pixels to azure (8).
    *   Stop the flood fill when encountering a red (2) pixel or any color other than white.
4.  **Replace Initial Azure:** After the expansion, change all pixels that were *originally* azure (8) (i.e., before the expansion) to yellow (4).
5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not white (0) or part of the original azure (8) regions remain in their original colors, including the red boundaries.

The most significant change is the addition of the restriction in the flood fill to stop at *any* color other than white, not *just* red. This prevents the azure from overwriting other colors in the grid. Also, refining the specification that only *originally* azure pixels become yellow.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
