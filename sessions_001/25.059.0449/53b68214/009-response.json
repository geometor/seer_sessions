The primary element is a vertical line of green (color code 3) pixels. The input grid is smaller (5x10) than the output grid (10x10). The green line remains in the same x-coordinate (column 2) in both input and output. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid's height, repeating the input pattern to fill the new rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A vertical line of green pixels (color 3) exists at column index 2 (the third column).\n\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's width remains the same (10 columns), but its height is doubled to 10 rows.\n\n3. **Vertical Pattern Repetition:** Duplicate the entire rows of input and append below.\n\n4.  **Preserve the Green Line:** The green line at column index 2 is preserved and extended to the full height of the expanded output grid. Effectively the input rows pattern repeats to the output height.\n"
