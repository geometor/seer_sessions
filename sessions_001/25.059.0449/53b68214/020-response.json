A \"repeating column pattern\" is defined as a sequence where a single pixel of a specific color appears, followed by one or more empty (0-value) pixels, and then another single pixel of the *same* color appears. The pattern is defined by the color and the number of rows between instances of the colored pixel.\n2.  **Extend Grid:** Increase the height of the grid by two rows.\n3.  **Replicate Patterns:** For each column that contains a repeating column pattern (as defined in step 1):\n    *   Continue the pattern into the new rows. Maintain the same color and the same spacing (number of empty rows) between colored pixels.\n4. **Copy Unmodified:** If a column does not contain a repeating column pattern, it will remain unchanged in those rows.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_repeating_patterns(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies repeating single-pixel patterns in each column.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, one for each column.
