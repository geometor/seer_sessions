Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements are:

*   **Input Grid:** A 2D array of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 2D array of single-digit integers, larger than the input grid, also representing colors.
*   **Colors:** Each digit corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the problem description).
*   **Expansion:** The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input grid.
*   **Symmetry:** The expansion seems to maintain some symmetry around the original input grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - width: 2 * input_grid.width
      - height: 2 * input_grid.height
  - relation: expansion
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: symmetric_duplication
  - action: duplicate_rows
     agent: process
     properties: 
        - input: each row in input
        - output: two copies of input row in output
  - action: duplicate_cols
     agent: process
     properties:
        - input: each new col generated from duplicated rows
        - output: two copies of col in output
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the Rows:** For each row in the input grid, create two identical copies of that row in the output grid, stacked vertically.

2.  **Double the Columns:** For each of the newly created rows from Step 1, take each element to build two identical copies of each column, placed horizontally adjacent to each other.

In essence, the input grid is "mirrored" both horizontally and vertically to create the output grid. Each pixel in the input becomes a 2x2 block of the same pixel in the output.
