Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors in the original grid seem to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern in the output grid. The transformation appears to be a form of mirroring or reflection, both horizontally and vertically, creating a symmetrical pattern.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)

properties:
  - symmetry:
    type: boolean
    value: true
  - reflection:
    type: string
    value: "horizontal and vertical"

actions:
 - name: reflect_horizontally
   type: replicate grid content across vertical axis
 - name: reflect_vertically
   type: replicate content across horizontal axis

relationships:
  - input_grid is transformed into output_grid
  - output_grid is a mirrored and expanded version of input_grid

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Copy** the input grid.
2. **Reflect** the input grid horizontally to create a new 3x3 grid to the right of the original.
3. **Combine** the original and the reflected grid, now creating the top half (3x6) of the final grid.
4. **Reflect** this combined 3x6 grid vertically to create the mirrored bottom half.
5. **Combine** the original combined grid with new reflected gird to get the complete output_grid.

In essence, the input grid is mirrored both horizontally and vertically to produce the output grid. The output grid's dimensions are double that of the input grid in both height and width.
