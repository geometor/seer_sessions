example_set: train
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
  - objects:
    - name: input_pixel
      properties:
        - color: variable (depends on the specific pixel value)
        - location: [row, col] (in the input grid)
    - name: output_block
      properties:
        - color: same as corresponding input_pixel
        - dimensions: 2x2
        - location: [2*row, 2*col] (in the output grid, based on input_pixel location)
  - actions:
    - name: replicate
      description: Each input pixel is replicated to form a 2x2 block.
      input: input_pixel
      output: output_block
