The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), red (2), and green (3). The transformations appear to involve changes in both the position and arrangement of colored pixels, often forming distinct geometric patterns or shapes. Sometimes a single colored pixel in the input may become a larger, filled shape like the letter 'L', or a spiral, or lines in the output. There might also be background filling.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the transformation, based on observing the three example pairs:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the non-white pixels in the input grid. These pixels act as \"seed\" points for the transformation.\n\n2.  **Expand and Fill:** Each non-white pixel becomes the starting point for a new shape. The shapes formed appear to trace a spiral-like or winding path.\n\n3. **Color preservation:** The output grid uses the color for each input non-zero pixel.\n\n4. **Specific cases for each example set:**\n    *   **Example 1 (azure):** Each azure pixel expands outward creating perpendicular lines forming a spiral.\n    *   **Example 2 (red):** Red pixels grow to be filled L shaped regions in the output.\n    *   **Example 3 (green):** Green pixels expand similarly to Example 1, creating a spiral.\n\n5. **General Rule** Each non-zero pixel is a seed to a winding/spiral shaped pattern using its color.\n\nLet's refine it further: the spiral pattern is similar across example 1 and example 3,\nbut example 2 transforms each single pixel to an \"L\" shaped pattern, therefore it\nmight be more accurate to assume \"L\" shaped patterns are developed from\nthe initial seeds and they are combined together in cases where they meet to\ncreate spirals and lines.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n1. **Identify key pixels:** Find all non-white pixels, these are the seeds\n2. **Grow L shapes:** For each seed, grow an \"L\" shape of the same color.\n3. **Combine:** Where two L shapes would intersect, combine them, creating longer\n   lines or spirals.\n\nThis description seems more accurate, and captures some of the interaction between the grown areas.\n"
