Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of mostly 'white' (0) pixels, with a few 'red' (2) pixels scattered within, into a grid where the 'red' pixels form a distinct, intricate, and seemingly symmetrical pattern. The input grid appears largely empty, while the output grid exhibits a complex, recursive "nested squares" structure made of red pixels. The background remains white. The sizes of input and output are same.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - color: mostly white (0)
      - size: 23x23
      - features: sparse red (2) pixels
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - color: mostly white (0)
      - size: 23x23
      - features: nested red (2) squares pattern

actions:
  - name: create_nested_squares
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Transforms sparse red pixels into a nested squares pattern.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    via: create_nested_squares
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify** the dimensions of the input grid (which are the same for the output grid).
2. **Create** an output grid of same size filled with white (0) pixels.
3. **Find** single red cells on the input grid.
4. **Iterate** from the outermost layer (size of the grid) to the innermost layer (size approaching 1) by step of 2:
   - **Draw** a square outline of red (2) pixels on the output grid. The size of current square matches the current iteration layer
   - reduce by 2 to have the next smaller square.
5. **Return** the modified output grid.

The core concept is to replace the sparsely located red pixels with a structured series of nested squares, maintaining the original grid dimensions and background color. The positions of input red pixels seems irrelevant.
