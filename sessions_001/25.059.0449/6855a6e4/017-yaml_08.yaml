facts:
  - object: red_shape
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: C-shaped, may be disjoint
      role: defines_horizontal_bounds_and_vertical_center
  - object: gray_pixel
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      role: moved_to_fill_red_shape_opening
    actions:
        move: gray pixels are moved, but total count is maintained.
  - observation: "Multiple disjoint red shapes can exist in a single input"
  - observation: "Gray pixels fill only the C-shaped opening of red shapes"
  - observation: "The count of red and gray pixels is the same in the input and output."
