objects:
  red_shape:
    color: red (2)
    description: Two vertically oriented, C-shaped structures facing each other.
  gray_shape:
    color: gray (5)
    description: Initially, isolated pixels and a horizontal line segment flanking the red shapes. In the output it's a horizontal line segment within the red structure.

actions:
  reposition:
    object: gray_shape
    description: The gray pixels move to fill the space horizontally enclosed by the red shapes.
    constraints: The move is limited to the horizontal center, and only grey pixels inside the horizontal range covered by red shape move

relationships:
  spatial_relationship:
      object1: red_shape
      object2: gray_shape
      relation_input: Gray pixels are located near and around the exterior of red shapes.
      relation_output: gray pixels horizontally fill space between red shapes.
  symmetry:
      type: horizontal
      description: The input and output grids are mirrored along a horizontal axis across the center.
