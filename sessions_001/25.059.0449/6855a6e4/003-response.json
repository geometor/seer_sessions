The primary colors observed are:\n\n*   0 (White): Background\n*   2 (Red): A prominent, seemingly connected shape.\n*   5 (Grey): Another distinct shape, possibly interacting with the red shape.\n\nThe transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement or shifting of these colored shapes, and potentially some overlapping. It seems there is one shape made up of red (2) pixels, and a separate one of grey(5) pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
