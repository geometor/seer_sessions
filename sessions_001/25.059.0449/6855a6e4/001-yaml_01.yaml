facts:
  - objects:
    - id: red_shape_1
      color: red (2)
      type: shape
      description: A shape resembling an incomplete rectangle or "C" shape.
    - id: gray_shape_1
      color: gray (5)
      type: shape
      description:  Initially, separate gray pixels or small groups of gray pixels. Becomes a contiguous block in output.
  - actions:
    - name: reposition
      subject: gray_shape_1
      description: Gray pixels move to be adjacent to other gray pixels.
    - name: merge
      subject: gray_shape_1
      description: Gray pixels merge/consolidate into a single, contiguous block in proximity to red shape, maintaining original gray shape footprint.
  - relationships:
    - type: proximity
      between: [red_shape_1, gray_shape_1]
      description: Gray shapes reposition themselves around the vertical center of red shape, filling inside, maintaining relative x positions.
  - constraints:
      - description: The bounding box of the transformed shape appears to equal the bounding box of original gray pixels.
      - description: Gray pixels maintain relative positions.
