The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), green (3), and yellow (4). The transformation appears to maintain the overall grid structure and most of the pixel values, with a very specific, localized change. The green pixels in the input are unchanged in the output, as are most white pixels. Only one white pixel is changed to yellow, and that pixel seems to have a specific location related to the green ones.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If there is a contiguous line of green pixels from left to right and from top to bottom, pick the white pixel that is at bottom-left of the meeting place of these 2 lines.\n3. **Change color to yellow** Transform the target white pixel's value from 0 to 4 (yellow).\n4.  **Preserve the rest:** All other pixels retain their original values.\n\nIn simpler terms, the program looks for the green pixels in the top-left region. It draws horizontal and vertical lines, and where these lines \"would\" intersect, it changes the color of the lowest, leftmost white pixel at this hypothetical location to yellow.\n"
