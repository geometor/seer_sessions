The input grid transforms into a modified output grid. The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8), magenta (6), and possibly yellow (4) is introduced. White(0) appears to be the background. The transformation seems to maintain the top four rows of the input in the output, while at row index `r=4`, the color `4`(yellow) replaces some of the zeros `0`(white).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
