The primary colors observed are green (3), red (2), and white (0).  The input and output grids have the same dimensions (7x7). The most notable change seems to be a vertical shift or re-arrangement of the colored components, while maintaining their relative positions. A red \"cross\" shape appears to be rotated by 180 degrees around its center. A green vertical line is copied below existing objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
