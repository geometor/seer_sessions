<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1808x1714 at 0x744068D7AB50>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program to describe the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are grids containing numerical values representing colors. The key colors involved seem to be red (2), green (3), and background/white (0).  The transformation appears to involve a shifting or repositioning of colored blocks, specifically a red block with a green center, or individual occurrences of green. The shapes formed by non-zero pixels are significant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_block
    color: red (2)
    shape:
      - description: rectangle in example 1
      - description: L-shape or connected component.
      - description: may have a green core
  - name: green_block
      color: green(3)
      shape: varies, can exist as a part of a red block or separately.
  - name: background
    color: white (0)
    shape: fills the remaining space

actions:
  - action: shift/copy
    description: the red block might shift upwards, or get duplicated on the upper side
  - action: reorder
    description: move blocks containing green upwards in input to the location of the similar shape in output

relationships:
    - relationship: red block and green core are positioned at the same place relative to each other
    - relationship: order of green and red blocks are maintained.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the connected components of red (2) pixels. Also, identify any isolated green (3) pixels or green pixels within the red blocks.
2.  **Analyze Output Structure**: Observe that connected components are present in both input and output.
3.  **Shift or Copy Red Block**: In the example given, it appears there is a connected 3x1 region of red color which is not present at the location of the input, but copied to just above it, keeping the green color pixels intact.
4. **Maintain Green Locations:** Green(3) pixels inside a connected red block are maintained to the relative position after the shift/copy
5. **Maintain Vertical Order if No Red Block**: If a green block is present outside the connected red block, the relative vertical order of all green pixels should be kept.
6. **Empty the original block**: After moving the red block, replace those cells with white(0)

In summary, the core transformation seems to be a structured shift or duplication of connected red block along with green pixels in and out of the red block, while maintaining the relative position of green pixels inside a red block, and empty the original location of the red block.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
