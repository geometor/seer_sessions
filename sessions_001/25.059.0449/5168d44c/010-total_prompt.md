Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 13x7 grid with pixels of colors white (0), green (3), and red (2). There are two distinct objects: a vertical line of green pixels and a square/rectangle of red pixels with a single green pixel in its center.
*   **Output:** The same 13x7 grid. The red square seems to have "shifted" upwards by two rows, while the green vertical line remains in the same position. The overlapping part of the red square, replaces part of the green line.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_line
    type: line
    color: green
    orientation: vertical
    position:
      column: 5
      start_row: 1
      end_row: 13 #changes in output
    behavior: static #does not move

  - id: red_square
    type: rectangle
    color: red
    dimensions:
      width: 3
      height: 3
    position:
      top_left_row: 4
      top_left_col: 4
    behavior: moves
    movement:
      direction: up
      distance: 2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the vertical green line and the red square (with a green center) within the input grid.
2.  **Green Line:** The position of the green line remains constant.
3.  **Red Square Movement:** Move the entire red square upwards by two rows. The green pixel within maintains it's relative position.
4.  **Overlap:** If the moved red square overlaps with any part of green pixels of the line, the green pixels are overwritten by the color of the red square.
5. **Output:** draw the new grid


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
