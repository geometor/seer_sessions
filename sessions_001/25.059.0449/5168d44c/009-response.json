Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 13x7 grid with pixels of colors white (0), green (3), and red (2). There are two distinct objects: a vertical line of green pixels and a square/rectangle of red pixels with a single green pixel in its center.\n*   **Output:** The same 13x7 grid. The red square seems to have \"shifted\" upwards by two rows, while the green vertical line remains in the same position. The overlapping part of the red square, replaces part of the green line.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
