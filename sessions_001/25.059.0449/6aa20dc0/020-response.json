Each non-azure pixel within the object serves as an \"origin\" for one of these replications.\n3.  **Shifting Rule:** The new position of each replicated object is determined by the initial row and column of the origin pixel used for that replication. Specifically, each pixel (r, c) of the *entire replicated object* is placed at a new location (r + origin_row, c + origin_col), where (origin_row, origin_col) is the position of the \"origin\" pixel within the original input grid.\n4.  **Background Preservation:** Any azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are not overwritten by the replicated object remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds connected components of non-azure pixels.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_object):\n        if (\n            row < 0\n            or row >= grid.shape[0]\n            or col < 0\n            or col >= grid.shape[1]\n            or visited[row, col]\n            or grid[row, col] == 8\n        ):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row + 1, col + 1, current_object)  # Diagonal\n        dfs(row - 1, col - 1, current_object)  # Diagonal\n        dfs(row + 1, col - 1, current_object)\n        dfs(row -1, col + 1, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] != 8 and not visited[row, col]:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions and background color (azure)\n    output_grid = np.full_like(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # Find the non-azure objects in the input grid\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # we expect one object\n    assert len(objects) == 1, f\"expected one object, got: {len(objects)}, {objects}\"\n    object_pixels = objects[0]\n\n    # Iterate through each pixel of the object to use as an \"origin\"\n    for origin_row, origin_col in object_pixels:\n        # Replicate the entire object, shifting it based on the origin pixel\n        for row, col in object_pixels:\n            new_row = row + origin_row\n            new_col = col + origin_col\n\n            # Copy the pixel to the new location if within bounds\n            if 0 <= new_row < output_grid.shape[0] and 0 <= new_col < output_grid.shape[1]:\n                output_grid[new_row, new_col] = input_grid[row, col]\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
