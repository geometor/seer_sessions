Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all connected regions (objects) of non-azure (8) colored pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Replicate and Shift:** For each object, replicate the entire object multiple times. Each non-azure pixel within the object serves as an "origin" for one of these replications.
3.  **Shifting Rule:** The new position of each replicated object is determined by the initial row and column of the origin pixel used for that replication. Specifically, each pixel (r, c) of the *entire replicated object* is placed at a new location (r + origin_row, c + origin_col), where (origin_row, origin_col) is the position of the "origin" pixel within the original input grid.
4.  **Background Preservation:** Any azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are not overwritten by the replicated object remain unchanged in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
