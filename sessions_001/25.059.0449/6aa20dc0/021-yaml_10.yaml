examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - object_1:
            color: 5
            shape: rectangle (3x3)
            position: (1,1) # Top-left corner
      transformation:
        - action: replicate
          origin: all pixels of object_1
          result: object_1 replicated at offsets determined by origin pixel positions, except for those that extend outside the grid.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - object_1:
            color: 3
            shape: rectangle (3x2)
            position: (1,3)
      transformation:
        - action: remove_row
          row: object_1.bottom + 1
          result: The row below object_1 is removed.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
          - object_1:
              color: 1
              shape: rectangle (2x1)
              position: (1, 1)
          - object_2:
              color: 2
              shape: rectangle(2x1)
              position: (1, 5)
          - object_3:
              color: 6
              shape: rectangle(1,1)
              position: (3, 2)
      transformation:
        - action: remove_row
          row: object_3.bottom + 1
          result: single row below object_3 is deleted.
  - example_4:
      input_objects:
        - object_1:
            color: 3
            shape: rectangle (2x3)
            position: (5,5)
      transformation:
          - action: None
            result: no changes
