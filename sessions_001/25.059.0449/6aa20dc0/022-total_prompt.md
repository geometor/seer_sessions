Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all connected regions (objects) of non-azure (8) colored pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Replicate and Shift:** For each object, replicate the entire object multiple times. Each non-azure pixel within the object serves as an "origin" for one of these replications.
3.  **Shifting Rule:** The new position of each replicated object is determined by the initial row and column of the origin pixel used for that replication. Specifically, each pixel (r, c) of the *entire replicated object* is placed at a new location (r + origin_row, c + origin_col), where (origin_row, origin_col) is the position of the "origin" pixel within the original input grid.
4.  **Background Preservation:** Any azure (8) pixels in the input grid that are not overwritten by the replicated object remain unchanged in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved replicating a single object using each of its non-background pixels as an origin. This approach works for the first example but fails on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule needs to generalize beyond simple replication based on all object pixels. We need to examine the other examples to discern a more general rule that takes object properties or spatial relationships into account. The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully inspect the input, expected output, and actual output for each example pair. Pay close attention to the differences (errors).
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns in how the input is transformed to the output across *all* examples. This might involve identifying a different "origin" concept, a different shifting rule, or a different object selection process.
3.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the more general transformation rule discovered in step 2.
4. **Refine the code:** modify and execute the code until the errors are zero.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To accurately analyze the examples, I will utilize a combination of visual inspection and simple python code.

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid):
    """Calculates differences between expected and predicted output."""
    diff = output_grid != predicted_output_grid
    num_errors = np.sum(diff)
    error_pixels = np.where(diff)
    return num_errors, list(zip(error_pixels[0], error_pixels[1]))

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all connected regions (objects) of non-background colored pixels within the input grid. The background appears to be the color filling the perimeter.
2.  **Check for a object at the bottom:** Check for the presence of an object on the penultimate row from the bottom (row index `height - 2`).
3.  **Conditional Row Deletion:** If an object is found with its bottom edge on row index `height - 2`
    then do not transform and return the input grid
    otherwise
    if an object is found with its bottom edge *not* on row index `height - 2`, then delete the row immediately below the bottom edge of this object.

This program correctly describes all four training examples. Example 1 implicitly
deletes rows, but since these are all the background color, there is no
perceivable change.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
