The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10). Several distinct colored objects are present, varying in size and shape. The primary change seems to involve specific color changes. I see a maroon object in the input that has been turned to grey in the output. All the other colored objects are the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
