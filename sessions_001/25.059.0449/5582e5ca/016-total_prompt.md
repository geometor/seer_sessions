**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x744068E61D50>

**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid of colored pixels, each with a numerical value (0-9) representing a specific color.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid where all pixels have the same color and value (6, which is magenta).
*   The dimensions of the grid (3x3) remain constant between input and output.
*    The output color (6/magenta) appears in the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (0-9) in input, constant (6) in output
      - value: corresponds to color

  - transformation:
      type: color replacement
      input_colors: all present in input
      output_color: '6' #Magenta
      scope: entire grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify a target color:** Find the value '6' within the input grid.
2.  **Flood Fill:** Change all pixel in the output grid to color that corresponds the the value of target color (magenta, represented by '6').

In essence, the transformation identifies a specific color/value (6) in the input and replaces all pixels in the output grid with that color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
