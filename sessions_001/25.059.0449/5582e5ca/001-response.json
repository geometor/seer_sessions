Each cell within the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. The transformation involves changing all cells of the input grid to a single, uniform color in the output grid. The key seems to be identifying which color from the input grid will be used for the entire output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
