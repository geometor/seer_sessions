Here's my analysis:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves manipulating colored pixels within a grid. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The input grid contains isolated and connected regions of red and yellow pixels, all surrounded by white pixels. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input, with some notable changes in the arrangement and potentially the quantity of colored pixels. The main change is that the output adds red to the edge of yellow.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

A region is defined as a group of pixels of the same color that are adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).\n2.  **Yellow Focus:** Specifically focus on all yellow (4) regions\n3.  **Yellow Expansion:** Create a copy of all of the yellow pixels\n4.  **Red Border:** Around each yellow pixel, check for white adjacent cells.\n5. **Fill:** Change the color of the adjacent cell to be red (2).\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule seems to create a red outline around the existing yellow shapes.\n"
