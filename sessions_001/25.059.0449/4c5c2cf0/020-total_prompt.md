Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 2D grids of pixels, where each pixel has a color value represented by an integer (0-9). The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grid appears to have two distinct "objects" or regions: a cluster of azure pixels in the center and a cluster of blue pixels in the lower-left corner. The output grid seems to be a modification of the input grid, specifically involving a replication or mirroring of the blue object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_cluster
    color: azure (8)
    shape: irregular, centrally located
    initial_position: row 7, column 5 (approximate center)
  - name: blue_cluster
    color: blue (1)
    shape: irregular, resembling a "corner" or "L" shape
    initial_position: row 10, column 1 (approximate top-left corner)

actions:
  - name: replication
    object: blue_cluster
    type: horizontal mirroring
    details: The blue cluster is copied and placed to the right of the original, with some overlap and some new pixels

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: azure and blue clusters are separated in the input.
  - type: replication, mirroring
    description: output shows what could be considered an additional blue object or shape related to the original one.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate two primary objects within the input grid:
    *   An azure (8) cluster in the center.
    *   A blue (1) cluster in the bottom-left.

2.  **Replicate/Mirror Blue Object:** Copy the blue (1) cluster.

3.  **Position the Copy:** Place this copied blue cluster to the right of the original. The positioning appears that the original L shape and the copy connects. New blue pixels is added so that the copied blue pixels mirror and adjoin the original blue pixels.

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Keep the azure (8) cluster and all other white (0) pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
