<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2640x1842 at 0x744068E7EED0>Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of the same dimensions, containing single-digit integer values (0-9) representing colors.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels of the same color form distinct objects.
*   **Background:** The background is consistently color 0 (white).
*   **Repetition/Symmetry:** The core observation is that objects in the input grid appear to be replicated or mirrored in the output grid, creating a symmetrical pattern. There's also a change of the object's size.
* **Colors:** There are multiple colors present, and objects retain their original color during replication, then all of the original colors are changed by the replication.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Background is always color 0 (white).
  - observation: |
     Non-zero colored regions form distinct objects.
  - observation: |
      Objects in the input are replicated in the output.
  - observation: |
      Replicated objects create a symmetrical pattern. There are replications above, below, left and right of the object.
  - observation: |
      The colors of the replicated objects are not changed.
  - observation: |
      The replicated objects have the same shapes, but different size.
  - observation: |
     The replication process appears to fill all available space of the same color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct objects (contiguous non-zero pixels of the same color).

2.  **Replicate and Expand:** For each identified object:
    *   Replicate the object to left.
    *   Replicate the object to right.
    *   Replicate the object up.
    *   Replicate the object down.
    *   The size of each object is kept the same horizontally, and vertically on the horizontal replications, and horizontally and vertically on the vertical replications.

3.  **Background:** Ensure the background (color 0) remains unchanged.

4. **Output** Ensure the final output size is the same as the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
