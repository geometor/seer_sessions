The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grid appears to have two distinct \"objects\" or regions: a cluster of azure pixels in the center and a cluster of blue pixels in the lower-left corner. The output grid seems to be a modification of the input grid, specifically involving a replication or mirroring of the blue object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
