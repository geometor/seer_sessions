Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Structure:** Find the vertical line of color 'green' (value 3) in the input grid. This is in column 4.
2.  **Select Rows:** Extract all the rows from the input grid that cross, contains pixels to the left and to the right, the veritical line of green.
3.  **Simplify Rows:** For each selected row, create a new, shorter row in the output.
4. **Preserve the first element:** The simplified row begins with the value 3, (the vertical green line), the first value of each simplified row.
5.  **Condense stretches:** All values to the right of the vertical line are condensed such
    that stretches of a single color are reduced to one pixel of that color
    in the order they appear.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
