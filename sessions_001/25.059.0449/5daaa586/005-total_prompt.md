Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the vertical green line, the vertical azure line, and the scattered red pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Select:** Select the green line, the azure line, and all red pixels.
3.  **Crop/Resize:**
    *   Remove the top blue horizontal line and bottom red horizontal line.
    *   Keep the columns containing the selected objects.
    *    Remove all rows above the highest and below the lowest selected pixels in the selected columns.
4. **Create new output**.
 *   Place selected Green line at the first column
 *  Place Azure line as the last column
 *   Place selected red pixels, maintaining their relative vertical positions within the new grid, towards the right, adjacent to the Azure line.
*    Fill background in white (0)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
