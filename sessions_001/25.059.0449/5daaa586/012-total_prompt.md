1.  **Identify Key Columns and Rows:** Locate the vertical line of color '1' (blue) in the input grid. Locate the horizontal line of '8' (light blue) at row three. Locate the horizontal line of color '6'(pink) at row ten. Locate the vertical line of '4'(yellow) at the third column.

2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Focus on a sub-grid region. The left border is the column of '4's, the right border is the column of '1'. The upper bound is the row of '8's, the lower bound is the row of '6's.

3.  **Output Generation:** Create the output grid. Maintain every pixel in the sub-grid, replace all other sub-grid pixels in columns 3,4,5,6 with '0'.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were based on observations from the first training example. While it correctly identified key structural elements (lines of specific colors), it failed to generalize to all training examples. The primary issue lies in the overly specific sub-grid extraction and modification rules, as shown by the failed test cases.  The strategy to resolve this is:
1.  **Re-evaluate Sub-grid Definition:** The current method of defining the sub-grid is too rigid. It relies on finding *complete* rows/columns of specific colors, which may not be present or may not define the relevant region in all cases. We need a more flexible approach.
2.  **Revisit the pixel modification:** Specifically identify the columns from the sub-grid that are modified.
3. Analyze the failed outputs: Pay close attention to where and why the code produces incorrect outputs.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the patterns, let's analyze each example. Note: I do not have
the capability to run code in this response, I can only develop it and document
it. I would use these scripts to inspect the data and results more precisely.

```python
import numpy as np

def print_grid(grid, title="Grid"):
    print(f"\n--- {title} ---")
    for row in grid:
        print(row)

def analyze_results(task):
    print(f"Task: {task['name']}")
    for i, example in enumerate(task['train']):
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output_grid = example['output']
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
        print(f"\nExample {i+1}:")

        print_grid(input_grid, "Input")
        print_grid(expected_output_grid, "Expected Output")
        print_grid(predicted_output_grid, "Predicted Output")

        if predicted_output_grid == expected_output_grid:
            print("Result: PASS")
        else:
            print("Result: FAIL")

Based on the provided test results and hypothetical data, here's what I've observed (remembering I cannot execute code in this response):

*   **Example 1:** PASS. The code correctly handles this case.
*   **Example 2:** FAIL.
    *   The sub-grid selection logic uses the pink row index + 1. This is
        incorrect, and may result in index out of range errors.
*   **Example 3:** FAIL
    * The sub-grid selection logic uses the pink row index + 1. This is incorrect.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Key Lines:** Find the vertical line of color '1' (blue) in the input grid. Find the horizontal line of '8' (light blue) at row index 2. Find the horizontal line of '6' (pink) at the row immediately above a row that is all '0's. Find the vertical line of '4' (yellow) at the third column.

2.  **Define Sub-grid:** Define the sub-grid with the top edge at the '8' row and the bottom edge at the '6' row. The right edge of the subgrid is the column of '1's and the left edge is the column of '4's.

3. **Create Output:** Generate the output grid. Create a copy of the
   input sub-grid. Iterate through the sub-grid copy, replace all
   pixels in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th columns with 0, unless the original sub-grid value
   is '8'.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
