The output is a smaller, simpler grid, also with colors. It seems like the output is a condensed or summarized version of the input. The vertical green line in the input (column of 3's) seems to be preserved as the leftmost column in the output. Horizontal lines of same-colored pixels crossing the green vertical line in the input, seem to be summarized in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
