objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        rows: variable number
        columns: variable number
  - row:
    type: 1D array
    elements: integers from grid
    properties:
        length: number of columns in the original grid or sub-grid
  - vertical_line:
      type: 1D array
      element: 3
      properties:
          position: variable, defines where the rows above will be cut
actions:
  - extract: Select specific rows or parts of rows based on color and possibly position relative to the vertical green line
  - rearrange:  Order extracted rows to form the output grid.
relationships:
  -  vertical_line_row_division:  The vertical green line(color 3) seems to act as a dividing marker for selecting sub-rows to keep in the output.
  - row_content_based_selection: Specific colors (and potentially their surrounding context) influence whether a row (or a portion of it) is included in the output.
