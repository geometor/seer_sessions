Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Structure:** Find the vertical line of color 'green' (value 3) in the input grid. This is in column 4.
2.  **Select Rows:** Extract all the rows from the input grid that cross, contains pixels to the left and to the right, the veritical line of green.
3.  **Simplify Rows:** For each selected row, create a new, shorter row in the output.
4. **Preserve the first element:** The simplified row begins with the value 3, (the vertical green line), the first value of each simplified row.
5.  **Condense stretches:** All values to the right of the vertical line are condensed such
    that stretches of a single color are reduced to one pixel of that color
    in the order they appear.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and made some specific assumptions, particularly about condensing only to the *right* of the green vertical line and inserting '4's to the end. The provided execution results clearly show that this isn't universally true across all examples. Some examples don't even *have* a green vertical line. This means we need to generalize our approach significantly. We'll need a strategy that doesn't depend on a specific color line and correctly handles rows. It looks like some are completely removed, others have portions extracted and there is some padding with '4's.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and the plan to address them:

1.  **Over-reliance on the green line (color 3):** The code fails when there is no green vertical line (e.g., example 2). The logic needs to be more general and identify structures or patterns without relying on a specific color.
2.  **Incorrect Condensation:** The assumption that condensation occurs only after column 4 is incorrect, and only for entries after a color 3.
3.  **Incorrect Padding:** The assumption about how padding works is also wrong. Instead of padding after the elements, it appears a different color and value (yellow - 4) is inserted into the interior of the row.
4.  **Row selection/removal.** Some rows are completely removed and that rule is not understood.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** We'll shift from looking for specific colors to identifying contiguous color blocks (objects) within each row, irrespective of their color.
2.  **Pattern Recognition:** Instead of hardcoding a vertical line, we will analyze all training examples to determine the relationship between input and output rows, based on these color blocks.
3. **Generalized Condensation/Extraction:** We must determine where and how the elements in the rows are preserved.
4.  **Padding Analysis:** Analyze where the padding is performed in relationship to the other colors.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the transformations better, let's collect some metrics using code execution. I'll focus on:

*   Presence/absence of a vertical green line.
*   Number of color blocks in each row (input and output).
*   Relationship between input and output row lengths.
*   Positions of padding color (4).

```python
import numpy as np

def count_color_blocks(row):
    """Counts the number of contiguous color blocks in a row."""
    blocks = 0
    current_color = None
    for cell in row:
        if cell != current_color:
            blocks += 1
            current_color = cell
    return blocks

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    """Analyzes a single input-output pair."""
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)

    # Check for vertical green line
    green_line_present = False
    for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
        if all(input_grid[:, j] == 3):
            green_line_present = True
            break

    # Analyze rows
    input_row_blocks = [count_color_blocks(row) for row in input_grid]
    output_row_blocks = [count_color_blocks(row) for row in output_grid] if output_grid.size > 0 else []

    return {
        "green_line": green_line_present,
        "input_row_blocks": input_row_blocks,
        "output_row_blocks": output_row_blocks,

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Row Selection:** Select rows from the input grid that have more than two color blocks, excluding solid rows of color 0.
2. **Object Identification:**
    *   Identify contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels within each selected row. Consider these as individual "objects."
3.  **Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through the selected rows.
    *   Iterate through the identified color blocks within the row.
4.  **Output Generation:**
    *   Create a new row in the output grid.
    *   For each selected row:
        *   Create a new object in the output, preserving the first pixel of each segment.
        *   If there is more than one segment in a row, insert a '4' between segments.
        *   If only one segment, do not include a '4'.

This revised program accounts for the variability observed across all training examples. It avoids assumptions about specific colors and focuses on generalizable rules about segments, and color 4 insertions..

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
