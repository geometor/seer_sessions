Okay, let's analyze this input-output example to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 12x12 grid, and the output is an 8x8 grid. This suggests a reduction in size.
*   The grids contain single-digit numbers, representing colors.
*   There's a prominent vertical line of '1' (blue) in the input, which seems to be preserved in the output.
*   There are horizontal lines of '8' (light blue), '6'(pink) and a column of '4' (yellow) in the input that seem important for the transformation.
* some '8' pixels are maintained, others are turned to '0'.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: 12x12
        output: 8x8
      elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: 1 (blue)
      position: second to last column in input, last column in output
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
        color: 8 (light blue), 6(pink)
        position: row 3 and 10 in input. rows 1 and 8 in the output.
  - type: column
    properties:
        color: 4 (yellow)
        position: column 3 in input, column 1 in output.

actions:
  - type: size_reduction
    description: The grid is reduced from 12x12 to 8x8.
  - type: color_preservation
    description: Specific colors and their arrangements (lines) seem to be preserved, while others are changed to 0.
  - type: object_selection
    description: specific color objects will be selected, others discarded.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Columns and Rows:** Locate the vertical line of color '1' (blue) in the input grid. Locate the horizontal line of '8' (light blue) at row three. Locate the horizontal line of color '6'(pink) at row ten. Locate the vertical line of '4'(yellow) at the third column.

2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Focus on a sub-grid region. The left border is the column of '4's, the right border is the column of '1'. The upper bound is the row of '8's, the lower bound is the row of '6's.

3.  **Output Generation:** Create the output grid. Maintain every pixel in the sub-grid, replace all other sub-grid pixels in columns 3,4,5,6 with '0'.
