"""
1.  **Identify Key Columns and Rows:** Locate the vertical line of color '1' (blue) in the input grid. Locate the horizontal line of '8' (light blue) at row three. Locate the horizontal line of color '6'(pink) at row ten. Locate the vertical line of '4'(yellow) at the third column.

2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Focus on a sub-grid region. The left border is the column of '4's, the right border is the column of '1'. The upper bound is the row of '8's, the lower bound is the row of '6's.

3.  **Output Generation:** Create the output grid. Maintain every pixel in the sub-grid, replace all other sub-grid pixels in columns 3,4,5,6 with '0'.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
