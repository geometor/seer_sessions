There are distinct rectangular regions of red and green.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 10x10 grid. The white (0) pixels from the input are gone. The red (2) and green (3) areas are still present, but the shape, size and area have changed. The Output grid appears to be composed of all 2s except a line of 3s.\n* **Transformation:** It seem that the input pixels are mapped to larger area in output, and that the 0 value has been used somehow to determine the background value of the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The top-left of each 2x2 block will map to row index `r*2`, col index `c*2`, where `r` and `c` are the input row and column of a non-white pixel.\n2. **Background:** Create an output grid and fill every cell with the value `2`.\n3. **Replacement:** Go through each pixel of the input.
