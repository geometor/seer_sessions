- task: "Replicate and Fill"
- objects:
    - grid:
        type: 2D array
        elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
        properties:
            - dimensions: variable
            - role: input, output, transformed
    - pattern:
        type: sub-grid of input_grid
        properties:
          - repetition: 2x2 in output_grid
    - fill_area:
      type: region
      properties:
        - location: output_grid cells not covered by pattern repetition
        - fill_values: determined by input and row/col index in output
- actions:
    - replicate:
        input: input_grid
        output: output_grid (partial)
        rule: repeat input_grid 2x2 times, starting at (0,0)
    - fill:
      input: fill_area of output
      output: complete output_grid
      rule: >
          The fill values are determined by the colors found at the edges of the input, the edges that are *extended* into the fill area.
          If the output row coordinate is equal or greater than the height of the input, use that coordinate to identify a row in the input, take all values and extend into the output.
          If the output column coordinate is equal or greater than the width of the input, use that coordinate to identify a column in the input, take all the values and extend into the output.
