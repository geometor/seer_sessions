The grids consist of single-digit integer values, which can be interpreted as colors. The input grids appear to be 5x5, while the output grids seem to be 10x10. A key observation is the repeating pattern of the input within the output, but also some added complexity. The output grid isn't *just* a repetition. There's a \"background\" added.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
