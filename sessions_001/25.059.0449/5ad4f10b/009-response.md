Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a large grid (22x23) filled mostly with '0' (white) pixels.
*   There are scattered '2' (red) pixels, some isolated, some in small groups.
*   There is a larger, contiguous block of '1' (blue) pixels in the upper-middle part of the grid.
*   The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) containing only '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels.
* The output seems to only retain the red pixels, and the position seems important, but heavily downscaled.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    id: input_grid
    dimensions: 22x23
    elements:
      - color: white  # 0
        count: majority
      - color: red    # 2
        count: several, scattered
      - color: blue   # 1
        count: one large block
  - type: grid
    id: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white # 0
        count: several
      - color: red   # 2
        count: few

actions:
  - type: filter
    description: Select only red (2) pixels from the input grid.
  - type: downscale
    description: Reduce the dimensions of the grid significantly, preserving relative positions of red pixels.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains output_grid (logically, not literally)
  - output_grid represents a highly abstracted version of input_grid, focusing on the red pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Isolate:** From the input grid, select only the pixels with the value '2' (red pixels). Ignore all other pixels.
2.  **Condense/Downscale:** Reduce the size of the grid to 3x3. Maintain a simplified representation of the original positions of the red pixels relative to each other within this reduced grid. The exact method of determining the new position in the downscaled grid probably needs to be a summary or average of the original coordinates of the red pixels. If two red pixels occupy the same cell after downscaling, retain any one.

Essentially, the transformation creates a "red pixel heatmap" or a very low-resolution thumbnail, showing only the red pixels in a highly condensed form. It's a drastic simplification, discarding most information but retaining a rough sketch of the red pixel distribution.
