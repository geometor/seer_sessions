The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids (3x3). The input grids seem to contain various colored objects, while the output grids appear to represent a simplified, abstracted version, focusing on the non-zero color distribution. The color white (0) appears to be a background. The salient colors seem to get extracted and placed in relationship to each other, and perhaps their relative positions in the larger input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider each unique color as a separate object. Ignore the background, which is white (value of 0).\n\n2. **Extract:** For each distinct non-zero color found, note its color value.\n\n3. **Simplify and Map:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\n\n4. **Relative Position Placement**:\n   * Divide input image conceptually into nine equal sectors based on the output grid dimensions (3x3). Imagine placing a 3x3 grid over the input image\n   * Map the extracted colors found into corresponding quadrants or regions of the 3x3 output grid to maintain approximate spatial arrangement. The dominant/first-encountered non-zero color in each of the nine regions will determine color value for the corresponding cell of output grid\n   * If a section in input grid contains only background, the corresponding section in the output grid will become background (0)\n\nIn essence, the program extracts the distinct colors from the input grid and places them into a 3x3 grid, roughly preserving their relative positions, based on dividing up the input space into nine segments.\n"
