objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (input), 3x3 (output)
      - colors: integers 0-9
      - background_color: 0

  - type: colored_blob
    properties:
     - color: integer (non-zero)
     - position: relative coordinates (x, y)

actions:
  - type: extract
    description: Identify colored blobs (non-zero pixels) in the input grid.
  - type: simplify
    description: Reduce the input grid to a 3x3 output grid.
  - type: reposition
    description: Place the extracted colors in the output grid, maintaining relative spatial relationships or some simplified form.

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: colored_blobs
  - output_grid_represents: simplified_input
  - output_grid_colors: derived_from: input_grid_colors
