Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A large grid (20x25) filled primarily with \"0\" (white pixels). There are distinct regions of \"4\" (yellow pixels) forming a large, somewhat rectangular shape. There are also scattered \"8\" (azure pixels) seemingly randomly placed, some bordering the yellow region, and some isolated.\n*   **Output:** A much smaller grid (3x3) containing only \"0\" (white) and \"8\" (azure) pixels. The \"8\" pixels form a sort of frame, with a single \"0\" in the center.\n*   **Dominant Colors:** White (0), Yellow (4) in Input, and Azure (8) and White(0) in Output. The yellow color is completely absent in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

I will need more example pairs to test the bounding box idea. If true, create a bounding box around the outter most azure colored pixels.\n\n3.  **Resize to Output:** Resample/Resize the Bounding box contents, into a 3x3 output grid. The method is not clear at this time.\n\n4.  **Eliminate other colors** Set all non-azure (8) pixels to be white (0).\n\nThe core idea seems to be focusing on the azure (8) pixels and their spatial arrangement, drastically reducing the grid size, and eliminating the yellow (4) color entirely. It is very unclear how the precise 3x3 output is created. I will need more information to understand how the information within the, hypothesized, bounding box is sampled, resampled, or summarized down to a 3 x 3 grid.\n"
