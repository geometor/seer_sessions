      The input and output grids are divided into subgrids.
  - observation: |
      The divisions are created by horizontal and vertical lines.
  - observation: |
      The dividing lines are made of green pixels in all the examples.
  - observation: |
    The colors of the pixels in the input subgrids are preserved in the output subgrids.
  - observation: |
      The location of the subgrids are the same in both input and output.
  - action: |
