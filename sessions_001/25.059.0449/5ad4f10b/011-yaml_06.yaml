objects:
  - name: red_clusters
    description: Connected groups of red pixels (8-connectivity).
    properties:
      - color: red (value 2)
      - connectivity: 8-connected (diagonals included)

actions:
  - name: identify_clusters
    description: Find all connected red pixel clusters in the input grid.
  - name: calculate_centroids
    description: Calculate the centroid (average row, average column) of each red cluster.
  - name: map_to_output
    description: >
      Map the centroids to the 3x3 output grid. The input grid is scaled down
      to 3x3. Centroid coordinates are divided by the scaling factors (input_rows / 3, input_cols / 3).
      The resulting coordinates are rounded down to the nearest integer to determine the output cell.
      If multiple centroids map to the same output cell, prioritize keeping the centroid from largest cluster
  - name: create_output
    description:  Create a 3x3 output grid, initially filled with zeros (white), and set the pixels corresponding to mapped centroids to red (value 2).
