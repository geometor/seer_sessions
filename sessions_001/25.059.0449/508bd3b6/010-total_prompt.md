Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid (likely 12x12) containing numerical values representing colors. The input grid contains a diagonal line of azure (8) pixels in the top left, and a large block of red (2) pixels at the bottom. The output grid introduces green (3) pixels, seemingly related to the position of the azure pixels, while maintaining the other elements. The green pixels form an inverse "L" shape, expanding down and right from each original azure.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_pixels
    type: individual_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    initial_positions: [(2,0), (3,1), (4,2)]
    properties:
      - static: false # Position potentially relevant to transformation
  - object: red_pixels
    type: block
    color: red (2)
    initial_positions: rows 10-12, all columns
    properties:
        -static: true # static through transformation
  - object: green_pixels
    type: generated_pixels
    color: green (3)
    final_positions: derived from azure_pixels
    properties:
      - static: false # Position derived
  - object: background_pixels
    type: empty space
    color: black (0)
    initial_position: all cells not azure or red
    properties:
        - static: false
  - action: generate_green
    description: New green pixels appear based on location of azure
    details: each azure expands into L
  - relationship: spatial
    description: Green pixels are placed adjacent to and below/right of azure pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify "azure" pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with a value of 8.
2.  **Generate "green" pixels:** For each azure pixel:
    *   Create a green (value 3) pixel directly to the right, if the cell exist within the grid, and is empty (value 0).
    *   Create green pixels downwards from the origin azure, incrementing the column (to the right), if cell exits within grid, and is empty, until a non-empty pixel, or the grid boundary is met.
3.  **Preserve Static Elements:** The large red block on the bottom of the grid stays in the same position and is unchanged.
4. All other elements stay in place.

In essence, the transformation rule takes each azure pixel and expands it into an "L" shape of green pixels to the right and down, stopping when there is no available cell, or they are out of the grid. The red block at the bottom remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
