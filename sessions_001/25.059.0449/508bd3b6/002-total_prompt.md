<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2384x1586 at 0x7440707375D0>Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are grids containing pixels of different colors (represented by integers 0-9). The most noticeable changes involve the introduction or shifting of green (3) pixels, while the azure (8) and red (2) pixels mostly remain constant. The white (0) pixels seem to act as a background. It appears that a sequence of green pixels is added, originating from a position relative to the existing azure pixels, extending diagonally upwards and to the left until interrupted by an edge or red object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    behavior: stationary, acts as an origin point

  - name: red_block
    color: red (2)
    behavior: stationary, acts as a boundary

  - name: green_pixel
    color: green (3)
    behavior: appears in a sequence, extends diagonally

  - name: background
    color: white (0)
    behavior: passive, filled by other objects

relationships:
  - type: diagonal_extension
    from: azure_pixel
    to: green_pixel
    direction: up-left
    termination: edge or red_block
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Green Pixel Insertion:** For each azure pixel:
    *   Begin inserting green (3) pixels diagonally upwards and to the left, starting from the position immediately above and to the left of the azure pixel.
3.  **Termination Condition:** Continue this diagonal insertion of green pixels until:
    *   The edge of the grid is reached.
    *   A red (2) pixel is encountered.
4. **Preservation:** Red pixels are preserved from input to output

In simpler terms, a diagonal line of green pixels grows up and to the left from each azure pixel, stopping when it hits a red pixel or the edge of the grid. The initial red blocks remain in their input positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
