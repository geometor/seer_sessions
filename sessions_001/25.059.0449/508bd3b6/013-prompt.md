Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule takes each azure pixel and expands it into an "L" shape of green pixels to the right and down, stopping when there is no available cell, or they are out of the grid. The red block at the bottom remains unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_pixels_by_color(grid, color):
    """Finds the coordinates of all pixels of a specific color."""
    return np.argwhere(grid == color).tolist()

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the described rule."""
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    azure_pixels = find_pixels_by_color(input_grid, 8)

    for row, col in azure_pixels:
        # Generate green pixel to the right
        if col + 1 < output_grid.shape[1] :
            output_grid[row, col + 1] = 3

            #extend to edge

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
