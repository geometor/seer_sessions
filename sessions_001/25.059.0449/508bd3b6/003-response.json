The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), azure (8), and green (3). The input grid contains a large white area, a vertical red rectangle on the right edge, and two azure pixels near the bottom-left. The output grid is very similar to the input, but a sequence of green pixels appears, seemingly originating from the top edge and moving downwards in a diagonal path.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
