The output grid has a distinct pattern of 2 (red) pixels, seemingly expanding outwards from the initial red pixel's location, but constrained in an interesting way. The background remains 0 (white). It seems the transformation is focused exclusively on the '2' pixels. The shape resembles a stylized, pixelated \"explosion\" or \"diamond\" pattern, expanding to the edges, but with the expansion decreasing as we move away from center.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This is the origin point.\n2.  **Vertical and Horizontal Expansion:** from the origin, draw a line of '2's to the edges in each of the vertical and horizontal directions.\n3.  **Diagonal Expansion:** Create diagonal lines of pixels with value '2', starting from the origin, going on the diagonals. The length of each line decreases as we move away from the central vertical and horizontal lines created in the last step.\n4.  **Complete Pattern:** Continue insetting this cross shape until it reaches the origin.\n5.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the expanding pattern should retain their original value of 0.\n\nIn simpler terms: Draw an inset cross pattern of red pixels (value 2) centered on the location of the original red pixel in the input grid. The cross pattern starts from the edges, and works inwards.\n"
