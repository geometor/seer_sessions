Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), acting as background.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves replicating the non-zero pixel in a specific pattern. It appears to be a diagonal expansion, possibly with wrapping around the grid edges.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note its color and original (row, column) position.\n2.  **Diagonal Replication:** Replicate this pixel diagonally in both directions (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).\n3.  **Modulo Operation/Edge Wrapping**: use the modulo operator with respect to the length/width in the direction of expansion. The new coordinates for a copy will by ( (row + i) % height, (col + i) % width) and ((row - i) % height, (col - i) % width) where height and width are grid dimensions and row/col are the original row/column location of the non zero pixel. i is the index of the copy.\n4.  **Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input. Place copies of the identified non-zero pixel value into the output grid according to the diagonal pattern and the edge wrapping rule. All other pixels in the output grid remain 0.\n\nEssentially, the original non-zero pixel acts as a \"seed\" that grows diagonally, wrapping around the edges of the grid.\n"
