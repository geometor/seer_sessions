            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core concept: locating a red pixel and drawing lines. However, it assumed the lines *always* extend to the edges of the grid. The test results clearly show this isn't always the case. The lines sometimes stop, indicating a constraint or boundary condition that the original program didn't account for. The boundary appears to be the presence of other non-white (non-zero) pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Boundaries:** We need to carefully examine the examples where the lines *didn't* extend to the grid edge. The key is to identify what stopped the line's extension.\n2.  **Refine the Rule:** We'll modify the natural language program to incorporate the identified boundary condition. It's likely that the lines extend until they encounter a non-white pixel.\n3.  **Object Properties** Update the YAML block facts based on new understanding of object properties.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo get precise metrics, I'll use a hypothetical `code_execution` function (since I can't actually execute code here) to describe the analysis steps and expected results.\n\n```python\ndef code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, transform_func):\n    transformed_grid = transform_func(input_grid)\n    comparison = np.array_equal(transformed_grid, output_grid)\n    print(f\"Input:\\n{input_grid}\\nExpected Output:\\n{output_grid}\\nTransformed:\\n{transformed_grid}\\nMatch: {comparison}\")\n    return comparison\n\n# Example Usage (Hypothetical) - assuming 'train' is a list of (input, output) pairs\n# Loop will be implicit in actual usage.\n# Assuming train is available in the environment\n# for input_grid, output_grid in train:\n#     code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, transform)\n```\n\nLet's manually perform the kind of analysis that code execution would provide, focusing on cases where the transform fails:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The provided code *works* for the first example, so the transform and output grids match. No errors here.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Red pixel at (1, 1). Blue pixel at (1, 4).\n    *   **Expected Output:** Red line stops before (1,4)\n    *   **Transformed Output:** Red line extends to the end.\n    *   **Mismatch:** The horizontal line is too long. The blue pixel should have acted as a boundary.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    **Input:** Red pixel at (2,4) surrounded by various colored pixels.\n    *    **Expected Output:** Red lines extend only until the nearest non-white.\n    *   **Transformed Output:** Red line extends to end in both directions.\n    *   **Mismatch:** Both lines are too long. The surrounding non-white pixels define the length of the lines.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: red_pixel\n    color: red\n    role: origin\n    properties:\n      - single_instance: true  # There's only one red pixel.\n\n  - name: red_line\n    color: red\n    role: extension\n    properties:\n      - orientation: [horizontal, vertical] # Extends in two directions\n      - boundary: non-white_pixel # The non-white pixels around the red pixel.\n\n  - name: other_pixel\n    color: [blue, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon, white] #Any color\n    role: boundary_condition\n    properties:\n      - stops_extension: true # Non-white pixels stop the red lines\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find the Origin:** Locate the single red pixel within the input grid. This pixel serves as the origin point.\n2.  **Draw Horizontal Line:** Starting from the origin's column, extend a horizontal line of red pixels to the right. Stop the line when a non-white pixel is encountered, or the edge of the grid, which ever comes first.\n3.  **Draw Vertical Line:** Starting from the origin's row, extend a vertical line of red pixels downward. Stop the line when a non-white pixel is encountered, or the end of the grid, which ever comes first.\n4. If no red pixel if found, return input unchanged.\n\nThis revised program accounts for the boundary conditions observed in the training examples. The lines emanating from the red pixel now stop when they encounter a non-white pixel.\n"
