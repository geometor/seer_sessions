Specifically, if a pixel is `x` positions away from the center column in the input, its corresponding pixel in the output is `x` positions away from the center column on the *opposite* side.\n\n2. **Vertical Reflection:** Simultaneously, the same principle applies vertically. If a pixel is `y` positions away from the center row in the input, its output counterpart is `y` positions away from the center row on the *opposite* side.\n\n3. Center point: Because the array has a odd number of rows and columns (7x7), the array will be reflected over the center point, (3,3).\n\nIn essence, each pixel's position is inverted relative to both the center column and the center row. This is equivalent to rotating the entire grid by 180 degrees around its center point.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid as a copy of input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # get dimensions for looping and center point calculation\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # iterate through each pixel of the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # calculate mirrored indices\n            mirrored_i = rows - 1 - i\n            mirrored_j = cols - 1 - j\n\n            # assign the value from input at (i, j) to the output at mirrord location\n            output_grid[mirrored_i, mirrored_j] = input_grid[i, j]\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
