**input:**

6 1 6 2
7 2 7 2
1 7 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x744070737BD0>

**output:**
```
2 6 6 6
2 6 1 6

2 2 7 1

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels.  The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (4x4 in this case). The transformation appears to involve a rotation of some kind, with the positions and/or colors of some elements changing.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements: pixels
      colors: [1, 2, 6, 7] # blue, red, magenta, orange

actions:
  - type: rotation
    description: 90 degree counter-clockwise
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input Interpretation**: The input is a 4x4 grid of colored pixels.

2.  **Transformation**: The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

3.  **Output**:  The output grid reflects this rotation, mapping all pixels to their new location after the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
