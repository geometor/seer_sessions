transformation_type: rotation
rotation_angle: 180
object_properties:
  - grid:
      dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      elements: pixels with color values
      center:
        - odd dimensions: exact middle pixel
        - even dimensions: conceptual center between pixels
actions:
  - horizontal_reflection: inverts horizontal distance of each pixel from center
  - vertical_reflection: inverts vertical distance of each pixel from center
  - combined_effect: 180-degree rotation around the grid's center
