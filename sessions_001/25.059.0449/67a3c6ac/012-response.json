This is equivalent to performing both a horizontal and a vertical reflection.\n\n1.  **Center Point:** Imagine a center point in the grid.  For grids with odd dimensions, this is the exact middle pixel.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Reflection:** Each pixel's horizontal distance from the center is inverted. A pixel `x` units to the right of center in the input becomes `x` units to the left of center in the output, and vice versa.\n\n3.  **Vertical Reflection:** Each pixel's vertical distance from the center is inverted. A pixel `y` units below the center in the input becomes `y` units above the center in the output, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Combined Effect:** Steps 2 and 3 together achieve a 180-degree rotation around the grid's center.  The pixel at position (i, j) in the input grid moves to position (rows - 1 - i, cols - 1- j) in the output grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # get dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # iterate through each pixel of the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # calculate the mirrored indices for 180-degree rotation\n            mirrored_i = rows - 1 - i\n            mirrored_j = cols - 1 - j\n\n            # assign pixel value from input to corresponding mirrored position in output\n            output_grid[mirrored_i, mirrored_j] = input_grid[i, j]\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
