Each pixel has a single-digit integer value representing a specific color. The transformation between the input and output grids seems to involve a mirroring or reflection of the pixel arrangement, with potential color changes based on original position/color. The dimensions of the grid (6x6) remain constant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Imagine a line running from the cell at (0,5) to (5,0).\n2.  **Color Swapping:** After the mirroring, perform these color swaps\n    *   blue (1) becomes blue(1) - no change\n    *   red (2) becomes red (2) - no change\n    *   orange (7) becomes orange (7) - no change\n    *   magenta(6) becomes magenta(6) - no change\n\nEssentially, the grid is flipped over the top right to bottom left axis, and colors are left unchanged.\n"
