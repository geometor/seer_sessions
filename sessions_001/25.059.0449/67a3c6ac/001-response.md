Okay, I've reviewed the provided input/output pairs. Here's my analysis of the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The transformation appears to be a rotation of the input grid. The colors themselves don't seem to change; rather, their positions within the grid are altered. The transformation is consistent across all examples. It's a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
transformation_type: rotation
rotation_direction: counter-clockwise
rotation_angle: 90
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
grid:
    properties:
        -dimensions: (height, width)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. Each pixel in the input grid maintains its color, but its position is changed according to the rotation. Specifically, a pixel at position (row, column) in the input grid will be at position (column, height - 1 - row) in the output grid, where height is the number of rows of input grid.
