            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were on the right track, focusing on azure (8) pixels and their right-hand neighbors. However, the code incorrectly added blue (1) pixels *after* any azure pixel that wasn't followed by another azure pixel. The examples reveal a more specific rule: a blue pixel is placed to the *left* of a *sequence* of azure pixels, but only if the azure sequence is at the edge of the grid or is next to a 0, and the blue pixel replaces a 0. The original code also incorrectly appended a blue pixel in cases where the sequence of azure was not adjancent to zero or an edge.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs, not just the first one, to identify the *complete* rule.\n2.  **Refine the rule:** Revise the natural language program to accurately describe the placement of the blue pixel *before* a sequence of azure pixels, not after isolated azure pixels.\n3.  **Consider edge cases:** Specifically address how the rule applies at the edges of the grid, since this seems to be part of the logic.\n4.  **Update the logic:** Adjust from an \"append\" to a \"prepend and only if adjacent to a 0 or an edge\" strategy.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on azure pixel sequences and their context:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n    0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 8 1 0 0 0 0\n    0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n    0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    ```\n\n*    Analysis\n    *   Row 2: `0 8 0` becomes `0 8 0`. The program should insert `1` to the *left* of the 8 if there is a zero to replace\n    *   Row 3: `0 8 8 0` remains unchanged. The 8s are adjacent, and no insertion is needed.\n    *   Row 4: `0 0 0 0 8 8 0`. remains unchanged.\n    *  Row 5: `0 0 0 0 0 8 0`. The program should insert `1` to the *left* of the 8.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n    0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n    0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n    0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n    0 0 0 0 1 8 0\n    0 0 8 1 0 0 0\n    0 0 8 8 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 1 8 0 0\n    0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n    ```\n\n*    Analysis\n    *   Row 1:  `0 0 0 0 8 8 0` - no change.\n    *   Row 2: `0 0 0 0 0 8 0` becomes `0 0 0 0 1 8 0`.  Blue is inserted to the *left* of the azure, replacing a zero.\n    *   Row 3: `0 0 8 0 0 0 0` becomes `0 0 8 1 0 0 0` - incorrect - should insert to the left.\n    *  Row 4 and 7, no change\n    *  Row 6, `0 0 0 0 8 0 0`, The program should insert `1` to the *left* of the 8.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: azure (8)\n    type: pixel_sequence\n    properties:\n      length: variable  # Length of the contiguous sequence of azure pixels\n      left_neighbor: [0, other]  # The color of the pixel immediately to the left (0 or edge)\n      right_neighbor: [any] # The color to the right (any color is possible)\n\nactions:\n  - name: insert_blue\n    condition: \"object.left_neighbor == 0\" #if sequence is next to a 0\n    preposition: \"before\"\n    target: object #target is a \"sequence\" not a single pixel\n    properties:\n      color: blue (1)\n      relative_position: \"replaces left_neighbor\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Sequences:** Find all contiguous horizontal sequences of azure (8) pixels.\n2.  **Check Left Neighbor:** For each azure sequence, examine the pixel immediately to its left.\n3.  **Conditional Insertion:** If the left neighbor is a 0, replace that 0 with a blue (1) pixel. If at the left edge, do not insert anything.\n4. **All Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not azure, or a zero to the left of an azure sequence, remain unchanged.\n\nThis revised natural language program accounts for the \"prepending\" behavior and the edge-case/zero-adjacent condition observed in the examples. It also clarifies that the operation acts on *sequences* of azure pixels, not individual azure pixels in isolation.\n"
