    rule: "If an azure pixel is at location (r, c), then if there isn't an
      adjacent azure pixel at (r,c+1), add a single blue
      pixel to the right at location (r, c + 1). If an azure
      pixel has an adjacent pixel to its left (r,c-1),
      add a blue pixel directly before that left neighbor.
