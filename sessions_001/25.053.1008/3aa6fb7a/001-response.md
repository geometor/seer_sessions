Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, representing colors. The primary color observed is 'white' (0) and 'azure' (8). The transformation seems to involve a very specific change related to the 'azure' colored pixels. Some, but not all, azure pixels change to blue (1).

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are the same size (7x7).
  - object: |
      'azure' pixels (value 8) are present in both input and output.
  - object: |
      'blue' pixels (value 1) are present in the output, but not in the input.
  - action: |
     Some 'azure' pixels (8) are replaced by 'blue' pixels (1).
  - relationship: |
      The 'blue' pixels in the output seem to appear where the 'azure' color connected, but not the pixel is at the edge of connected 'azure' blocks.
  - rule: |
      change an azure pixel to blue if and only if it is an azure pixel, it's on at an edge and it's neighbor on that edge is not azure

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** 'azure' pixels (value 8).
3.  **Check Edge and Neighbor Condition:** For each identified 'azure' pixel, examine its neighboring to determine if it is at the "end" of the block of connected azure pixels:
    *   change an azure pixel to blue if and only if it is an azure pixel, it's on at an edge and it's neighbor on that edge is not azure
4.  **Modify:** If an 'azure' pixel is directly adjacent to any pixels that *not* connected to another azure pixel, change its value to 'blue' (1).
5.  **Maintain all other pixels**
