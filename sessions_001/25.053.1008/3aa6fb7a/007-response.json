The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). There's a noticeable change with the introduction of blue (1) pixels in the output. These blue pixels seem to be related to the positioning of the azure pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
