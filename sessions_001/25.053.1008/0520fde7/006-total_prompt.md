# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 1 5 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1
0 1 1 5 1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x762C40177FD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x762C40176020>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger and more complex than the output grid. Colors present include white (0), blue (1), and grey (5). The output grid contains only white (0) and red (2). There's a noticeable reduction in size and a change in color composition. The grey (5) pixels seem to be completely removed, and blue(1) pixels seem to be the key of changing to red(2).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x7 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 5 (grey).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 0 (white) and 2 (red).
  - observation: The gray (5) column in the input is removed entirely in output
  - observation: The blue(1) pixels surrounding gray column change into red(2)
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x7
      colors: [0, 1, 5]
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 2]
  - relationship: InputGrid transforms to OutputGrid.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: A subgrid is extracted from the input grid.
  - action: recolor_pixels
    description: some white and blue pixels may change color to red.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Center Column:** Locate the central vertical column (column index 3, since there are 7 total) in the input grid.
2.  **Remove Central column**: Vertical central column is completely removed from the grid.
3. **Locate blue pixels**: Check surrounding areas of central column to find blue(1) pixels.
4.  **Change color of blue pixels to red:** For surrounding blue(1) pixels, transform them to red(2)
5. **Final Output:** The final result of the transformation is produced.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
