The input grid seems to have a larger size and includes several colors (white, blue, gray), while the output grid is smaller (3x3) and features only white and red colors. The central pixel in the output grid appears to be red (value 2), while all other pixels are white (value 0). There's a prominent vertical gray stripe (value 5) in the input. The blue and white pixels seem to form a repeating, alternating pattern, which is discarded in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
