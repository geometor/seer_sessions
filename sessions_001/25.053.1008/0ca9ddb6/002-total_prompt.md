Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (9x9). The input grid contains two distinct colored pixels: red (2) and blue (1), with the rest being white (0). The output grid retains the original red (2) and blue (1) pixels in their original positions. However, new pixels are added: yellow (4) and orange (7). The yellow pixels appear to be related to the red pixel, while the orange pixels are related to the blue pixel. The added pixels form specific shapes around the original pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_pixel
    color: red
    value: 2
    initial_position: (3, 2)
  - id: blue_pixel
    color: blue
    value: 1
    initial_position: (6, 6)
  - id: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow
    value: 4
    relation: "adjacent to red_pixel"
  - id: orange_pixels
    color: orange
    value: 7
    relation: "adjacent to blue_pixel"

actions:
  - type: add_pixels
    object: yellow_pixels
    pattern: "two pixels, one above and one below red_pixel"

  - type: add_pixels
    object: orange_pixels
    pattern: "three pixels in an L shape, one above and two to the right of blue_pixel"
relationships:
  - object1: red_pixel
    object2: yellow_pixels
    type: adjacency
    details: "Yellow pixels are vertically adjacent (above and below) to the red pixel."
  - object1: blue_pixel
    object2: orange_pixels
    type: adjacency
    details: "Orange pixels form an L-shape adjacent to the blue pixel (one above, and two to the right)."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Red Pixel Transformation:** For the red pixel, add two yellow (4) pixels: one directly above and one directly below its original position.
3.  **Blue Pixel Transformation:** For the blue pixel, add three orange (7) pixels: one directly above, one to it's right, and one more to the right of that.
4.  **Preserve Originals:** Keep the original red and blue pixels in their original positions.
5. **Output:** output is created by adding these pixels to the input.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
