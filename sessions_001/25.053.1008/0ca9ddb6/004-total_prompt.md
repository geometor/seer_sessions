# Example

**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x762C40FDF040>

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains several distinct colored pixels (blue, red, azure) against a background of white (value 0). The output grid introduces new colors (orange, yellow) and expands or modifies the existing colored areas. There appears to be a relationship between the original colored pixels and the newly introduced colors and shapes. The azure (8) pixel in the input seems unchanged in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - height: 9
      - width: 9
      - values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)

  - object: pixel
    description: individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - location: (row, column) coordinates

  - observation: input_colors
    description: Colors present in the input grid
    values: [0, 1, 2, 8]

  - observation: output_colors
    description: Colors present in the output grid
    values: [0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8]

  - observation: unchanged_pixel
    description: Azure pixel (8) remains in the same location.
    location: (0, 3)

  - observation: color_7_relation
    description: Orange (7) pixels appear adjacent to blue (1) and red(2) pixels.
    
  - observation: color_4_relation
    description:  Yellow(4) appears to form crosses, potentially related to the positions of orange(7).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the locations of all blue (1) and red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Create** orange (7) pixels adjacent to the identified blue and red pixels. Adjacency includes diagonals. If an orange pixel can be placed adjacent to both a blue and red pixel, perform this fill.
3.  **Extend** yellow (4) cross shapes (one pixel wide extending vertically and horizontally by one unit) from orange(7). For each orange pixel created on step 2, a yellow cross is extended from it, unless:
 * It overlaps with an already existing pixel.
 * It goes beyond the border of the grid.
4.  **Preserve** the azure (8) pixel from the input grid; copy it to the output grid in the same location.

Essentially, the blue and red pixels act as "seeds" for generating orange regions, which in turn generate the yellow crosses. The azure pixel is an unchanging landmark.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
