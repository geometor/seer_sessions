The primary object is a shape composed of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. This shape appears to be modified based on its surrounding context, resulting in a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels in the output grid. The background remains unchanged as white (0) pixels. The shape has different segments that are treated differently. It appears horizontal lines are replaced with azure and vertical are replaced by red.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This is the primary shape.\n3. **Segment Identification**: Find the segments of the contiguous block, defining segments as only single pixel width horizontal or vertical lines of pixels\n4.  **Horizontal Segment Replacement:** Replace each horizontal line segment of the gray shape with pixels of value 8 (azure).\n5.  **Vertical Segment Replacement:** Replace each vertical line segment of the gray shape with pixels of value 2 (red).\n6.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the unchanged background, and the transformed shape with azure and red segments.\n"
