Pixels can be various colors, represented by the digits 0-9. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and magenta (6). There's a noticeable shift or movement of certain colored pixels between the input and output grids. It seems that only specific colors from the input are preserved or moved in the output, and empty cells between colors of interest might also change.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The 1 and 2 maintain position relative to each other in the bottom right.\n\n  - observation: positional_shift\n    description: The position of each color section shifts down and possibly across.

If other color pixels occupy all the rows, move color 3 down as far down as possible.\n\n3.  **Magenta (6) Placement:** Place the magenta (6) pixel in the bottom-left corner (row 4, column 0).\n\n4.  **Blue (1) and Red (2) Movement:** Move the blue (1) and red (2) pixels such that they retain their relative horizontal relationship. The blue and red will occupy the two rightmost spaces, placing the blue pixel in the first available spot in the first available row from the bottom up. Then place the red pixel relative to the blue one.\n\n5.  **Clear Remaining:** All other cells are set to white (0).\n"
