The transformation seems to involve the introduction of the value 1 (blue) in specific locations relative to the existing 8 (azure) pixels. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. It appears the azure colored pixels may be acting as seeds, from which the new blue colored pixels emerge.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
