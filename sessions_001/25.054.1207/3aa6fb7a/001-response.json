The input grid contains azure (8) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that some of the azure pixels are replaced by blue (1) pixels. The blue pixels appear to be replacing azure pixels that are at the \"top\" of azure regions that extend down and possibly right.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"
