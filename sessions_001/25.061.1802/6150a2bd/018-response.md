The input grid is reflected along its horizontal axis (x-axis). This is equivalent to flipping the grid vertically, where the top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on. The colors and shapes within the grid remain unchanged, only their positions are altered according to the reflection.
