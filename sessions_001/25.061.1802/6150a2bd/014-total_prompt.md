**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x739C99940F10>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x739C99940D90>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
*   **Colors/Numbers:** Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color.
*   **Rotation:** The entire grid appears to be rotated.
*   **Mirroring/Flipping**: after rotation, some type of mirroring could be involved

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cells:
        - value: integer (0-9)
          role: color_code
actions:
  - name: rotate
    agent: grid
    parameters:
      direction: clockwise or counter clockwise # Need to establish the direction
      degrees: 90 # multiple of 90
  - type: mirror
    parameters:
        axis: horizontal or vertical #axis might need inverting based on the rotation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Mirror:** Mirror image the rotated grid along its vertical axis.

Essentially input is mirrored across the diagonal running from the top left to the bottom right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
