Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code (90-degree counter-clockwise rotation) were correct for the first training example. The core logic of rotating the grid is sound. Let's examine the new cases to ensure comprehensive understanding.

**Metrics and Observations**
All examples are correct. No need for specific reports.

**YAML Block - Facts**

```yaml
task: 00d62c1b
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable dimensions
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: dimensions are swapped and reversed compared to input_grid (due to rotation)
  - action: rotate
    description: The input_grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    details:
      - The rotation swaps rows and columns.
      - The order of rows in the input becomes the order of columns in the output, but in reversed sequence.
```

**Natural Language Program**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. All elements maintain their original values, only their positions within the grid change according to the rotation. The number of rows in the input grid becomes the number of columns in the output grid, and the number of columns in the input grid becomes the number of rows in the output grid. The order of elements is also adjusted to reflect the counter-clockwise rotation.
