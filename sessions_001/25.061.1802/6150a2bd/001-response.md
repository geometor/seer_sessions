Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task. Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements**

The task involves two 3x3 grids in each example. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a different color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation and possibly some form of mirroring or reflection. The relative positions of the numbers change significantly, suggesting a reordering rather than a simple in-place modification. The colors remain associated with their original numbers throughout.

**YAML Block - Facts**



```yaml
task: rotation_reflection
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
properties:
  - color: determined by integer value
actions:
  - rotate: grid content is rotated
  - reflect: possibly mirrored, needs further investigation
relationships:
  - input_grid: initial state
  - output_grid: transformed state
```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Reception:** The program receives a 3x3 grid of integers, where each integer represents a color.

2.  **Rotation:** The entire input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Imagine grabbing the upper right corner and twisting to lower right.

3.  **Output:** The rotated grid is the output.

The key concept is the 90 degree clockwise rotation of the grid, and not a reflection.

The colors/numbers maintain consistant relatonships, all being rotated together.
