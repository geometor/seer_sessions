task: 00d62c1b
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: variable dimensions
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - shape: dimensions are swapped and reversed compared to input_grid (due to rotation)
  - action: rotate
    description: The input_grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    details:
      - The rotation swaps rows and columns.
      - The order of rows in the input becomes the order of columns in the output, but in reversed sequence.
