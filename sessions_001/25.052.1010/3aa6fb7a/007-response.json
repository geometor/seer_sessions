            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the discrepancies between the expected outputs and the transformed outputs generated by the previous code, and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**Analysis of Errors**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code incorrectly placed a blue (1) cell at the top-right of the *bottom* 2x1 azure rectangle. The rule specifies bottom-left for all but the topmost rectangle. It also failed to place a cell at bottom-left of second vertical azure rectangle.\n*   **Example 2:** The code misses placing some blue and azure cells.\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule identifies vertical azure (color 8) rectangles of size 2x1. It then adds a blue cell (color 1) based on the rectangle's position relative to other azure rectangles:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Rectangles:** Locate all 2x1 vertical rectangles of color 8 (azure).\n2.  **Topmost Rectangle Rule:** For the topmost 2x1 azure rectangle, a blue cell is added to its top-right.\n3. **All the rest:** Add blue cell at bottom-left.\n\n**Detailed Explanation and Improvements**\n\nThe core issue in the previous code was a misinterpretation how to manage different parts within azure colored vertical objets.\n\n1.  **Vertical 2x1 Only**: We ONLY consider the 2x1.\n2. **Top Right**: If is at the top.\n3.  **Bottom Left**: If is not at the top.\n\nLet's proceed to update the Python code based on this revised understanding.\n"
