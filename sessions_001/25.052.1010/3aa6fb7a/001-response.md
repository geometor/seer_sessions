Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Block Summary**

```yaml
observations:
  - object_1:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Two separate 2x1 rectangles
      position: 
        - Top rectangle: Starts at row 2, column 2
        - Bottom rectangle: Starts at row 4, column 5
      count: 2
  - object_2:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell 
      position: NA
      count: 2 in the output.
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two separate objects of color 8 (azure). Each object is a 2x1 rectangle.

2.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Locate the top right corner of object 1 (top rectangle). Insert color 1 (blue) at this cell.
    *   Locate the bottom left corner of object 2 (bottom rectangle). Insert color 1 (blue) at this cell.

**Explanation of the "Story"**

The transformation rule looks like adding number "1" (blue color) at the corners of shape 8.
