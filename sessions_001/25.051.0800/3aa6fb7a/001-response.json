These exist as two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles.\n\n2.  **Determine Placement:** For each azure rectangle, identify its location and dimensions.\n\n3.  **Add Blue Pixels:** For each azure 2x1 rectangle:\n    *   If the azure rectangle is in the top left quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its right.\n    *   If the azure rectangle is in the bottom rigth quadrant of the grid add a blue (color 1) pixel to its left.\n\n4. **Maintain the rest:** All other cells in the input grid remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule preserves the azure rectangles and adds a single blue pixel adjacent to specific sides of each azure rectangle based in its position.\n"
