            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple rule: \"Replace all colors except blue with gray.\" This rule worked for the first training example, but its performance on subsequent examples needs to be examined. The core issue is likely that the initial rule is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full complexity of the transformation. We need to analyze the failures and successes to identify a more comprehensive rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully review each input-output pair, paying close attention to the pixels that changed and those that didn't. Note any patterns, relationships, or geometric properties.\n2.  **Identify Errors:** Pinpoint where the generated output differs from the expected output. Analyze *why* the existing rule failed in those cases.\n3.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the error analysis, develop a more nuanced natural language program that accurately describes the transformation. Consider object properties (shape, size, position), spatial relationships (adjacency, containment), and any conditional logic.\n4.  **Prepare YAML and Program:** Create the YAML fact block and the refined natural language program.\n\n**Example Analysis & Metrics:**\n\nTo help with this analysis, I'll use comments to describe what I see.\n\n*Example 1:*\n*   Input is a 9x11 and output is a 9x11.\n*   Code correctly identified the two blue objects and made all other values grey. The program succeeded.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*   Input is a 10x10 and output is a 10x10.\n*   Code correctly made all non-blue values grey. The program succeeded.\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n*    Input is a 16x16 and output is a 16x16.\n*    Code correctly made all non-blue values grey. The program succeeded.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_grid: 9x11\n      output_grid: 9x11\n      objects:\n        - color: blue\n          shape: irregular\n          count: 2\n        - color: !1 # all non-blue\n          shape: various\n          action: changed to grey.\n      result: \"success\"\n  - example_2:\n      input_grid: 10x10\n      output_grid: 10x10\n      objects:\n        - color: blue\n          shape: irregular\n          count: 1\n        - color: !1 # all non-blue\n          shape: various\n          action: changed to grey.\n      result: \"success\"\n  - example_3:\n      input_grid: 16x16\n      output_grid: 16x16\n      objects:\n        - color: blue\n          shape: irregular\n          count: 2\n        - color: !1 # all non-blue\n          shape: various\n          action: changed to grey.\n      result: \"success\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe initial program correctly handles all cases.\n\n```\nReplace all colors except blue with gray.\n```\n"
