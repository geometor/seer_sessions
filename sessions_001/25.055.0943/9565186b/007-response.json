The colors are represented by single-digit integers.  The most prominent change is the replacement of certain colors with others, specifically colors other than '1' (blue) seem to be targets for replacement. The color '1' (blue) appears to be preserved. The replacement color seems to be '5' (gray).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
