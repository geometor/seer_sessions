Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is conceptually rotated 90 degrees clockwise. However, instead of a strict rotation, each '9' pixel in the input is individually moved to its corresponding rotated position in the output.  The '0' pixels act as a background and are filled in after the '9' pixels are placed.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with all zeros, matching the dimensions of a rotated input grid.
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])
    output_grid = [[0] * rows for _ in range(cols)]  # Note: Dimensions are swapped due to rotation

    # Iterate through the input grid to find '9' pixels.
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r][c] == 9:
                # Calculate the new position after a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
                new_row = c
                new_col = rows - 1 - r
                # Place the '9' in its new position in the output grid.
                output_grid[new_row][new_col] = 9

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a 90-degree clockwise rotation, but it *only* moves the pixels with a value of '9'. It fills the rest of the output grid with '0's. The core issue is that this transformation doesn't account for other pixel values and their movements/transformations, as seen in the additional examples where the function doesn't reproduce the provided example output. The strategy to address this is to determine the *actual transformation*, looking at all pixel colors, not only for '9'.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**
Here's a detailed look at the provided input, expected output, and function
output. The provided results of `transform` will allow for more information.

- **Result:** The function performed as described. The result is that the
  input and function output are rotated 90 degrees clockwise

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 9]
      - shape: (variable, variable)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 9]
      - shape: (variable, variable)

actions:
  - name: rotate_9s
    description: Rotate only the '9' pixels 90 degrees clockwise.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify '9' Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with the value '9' (maroon).
2.  **Rotate '9's:** For each '9' pixel, calculate its new position as if the entire grid were rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  The row index becomes the new column index, and the new row index is calculated as `(number of rows in input - 1 - original column index)`.
3. **Background fill:** Fill the rest of the cells with 0.

The previous description and the new description are identical.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
