The primary colors involved are maroon (9) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a change in the position of the white and maroon pixels. There appears to be some kind of rotation or reflection involved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

After this translation the grid is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nAnother, possibly simpler way, to describe it:\nThe input grid is transformed by changing the top-middle cell to white if it is originally maroon, copying all the rest of the left most colum, duplicating the white color to the cell underneath and keeping the rest of the input grid, effectively creating a 2x1 vertical domino of white colored cells.\n\n"
