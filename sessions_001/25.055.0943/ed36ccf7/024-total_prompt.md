Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the entire input grid. All of the white pixels (0) in the output are at the same coordinate locations as the input.
"""

import numpy as np

def rotate_grid_90_clockwise(grid):
    return np.rot90(grid, k=-1)

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and preserves white pixels.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise
    rotated_grid = rotate_grid_90_clockwise(input_np)

    # Create the output grid by copying the rotated grid
    output_grid = rotated_grid.copy()

    # Preserve white pixels (0) from the original input grid
    for i in range(input_np.shape[0]):
        for j in range(input_np.shape[1]):
            if input_np[i, j] == 0:
                output_grid[i, j] = 0

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of a 90-degree clockwise rotation with preservation of white pixels was incorrect. The provided code's attempt to preserve white pixels at their original input coordinates within the rotated grid is fundamentally flawed. The white pixels should also rotate with the rest of the grid. The core issue is that the initial natural language program and, consequently, the code, didn't correctly capture the actual transformation. It seems that only a rotation needs to happen, so the white-pixel preservation is unnecessary.

**Strategy:**
1.  Remove the incorrect white-pixel preservation logic, it is not performing the intended task.
2.  Re-evaluate the core transformation rule based on the provided results, it will likely be a simple rotation
3. Update the YAML and Natural Language program

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To confirm, I need to describe the details about each of the examples, I will provide the dimensions and a description of the input and the expected output

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 3x3
*   **Output Dimensions:** 3x3
*   **Description:** A small 3x3 grid. A 90-degree clockwise rotation.
    Input:
    [[0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0]]

    Output:
    [[0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0]]

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 5x5
*   **Output Dimensions:** 5x5
*   **Description:** A 5x5 grid. A 90-degree clockwise rotation.
    Input:
     [[0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]]

    Output:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

**Example 3:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 7x7
*   **Output Dimensions:** 7x7
*   **Description:** A 7x7 grid. A 90-degree clockwise rotation.
    Input:
    [[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

    Output:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - content: pixels with integer values (0-9)
    actions:
      - name: rotate
        description: Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
        parameters:
          - direction: clockwise
          - angle: 90 degrees

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the entire input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
