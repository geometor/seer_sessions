Each pixel has a color value, represented by an integer (0 for white, 2 for red). The transformation seems to involve rearranging the red pixels within the grid while keeping the white pixels in their original positions. The change in the arrangement of red pixels suggests a rotation or reflection.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
