Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed by changing the top-middle cell to white if it is originally maroon, copying all the rest of the left most colum, duplicating the white color to the cell underneath and keeping the rest of the input grid, effectively creating a 2x1 vertical domino of white colored cells.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # change the top-middle cell to white (0)
    output_grid[0, 1] = 0
    
    #Copy first column
    output_grid[:,0] = input_grid[:,0]

    # duplicate the white color to the cell underneath if top-left corner is also white
    if output_grid[0,0] == 0:
      output_grid[1, 0] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a limited observation (likely just the first training example). The provided results across multiple training examples reveal inconsistencies. The initial program doesn't capture the full logic of the transformation. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification, focusing too much on specific color (maroon) and a hardcoded location (top-middle) and single column instead of a more general pattern. The presence of errors indicates the need to:

1.  **Identify the common pattern:** Analyze all input/output pairs to determine the *consistent* rule applied across all examples.
2.  **Generalize:** Avoid hardcoding specific colors or positions unless they are truly invariant across all examples.
3.  **Focus on relationships:** Consider spatial relationships, object properties, and how they change from input to output.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification)**

To better understand the transformations, let's gather precise metrics and observations about each example. I'll use `code_execution` to achieve this. I'll focus on properties that seem relevant based on the initial attempt and observed failures:

*   Dimensions of input and output grids.
*   Presence and location of specific colors.
*   Changes in pixel values between input and output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
