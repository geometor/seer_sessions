## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE9CB490>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE77BC70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains only the values 0 and 5, which correspond to white and gray, respectively. The output grid contains the values 2, 3, and 4, which represents red, green, and yellow, respectively. The positions of cells are preserved during the transformation; that is, a cell at a specific row and column in the input grid maps directly to the same row and column in the output grid. The transformation appears to be a mapping or substitution of colors/values with a consistent scheme.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid is 3x3."
  - observation: "Output grid is 3x3."
  - property: "Input grid values are 0 and 5."
  - property: "Output grid values are 2, 3, and 4."
  - relationship: "Grid cell positions are maintained between input and output."
  - action: "Value 0 in the input is replaced by value 3, 4, and 2 in a clockwise fashion around the outside of the grid."
  - action: "Value 5 in the input is replaced by value on the outside of the grid that is clockwise from it, in the output."
  - relationship: "There's a one-to-one mapping between input values and output values, where a particular number in the input always becomes the same number in the output."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid, preserving its row and column position.
2.  **Examine** the value of the current input cell.
3.  **The 0s on the edge get replaced in this clockwise order: 3, 4, 2**
4. **The 5 is replaced by the number that is next in the clockwise ordering on the edge.**

In this particular example:
*   Top Left zero becomes top center 3.
*   Top Right five becomes top right 3.
*   Middle left 0 becomes 4 in middle left, and middle center 5 becomes 4 in the middle center
*  Bottom left 5 becomes bottom left 2.
*   Bottom Center and Right 0 becomes Bottom Right 2

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
