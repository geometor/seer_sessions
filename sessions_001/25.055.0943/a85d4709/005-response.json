            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of replacing 0s (white pixels) based on their proximity and direction relative to 5s (gray pixels), seemingly in a clockwise pattern. The provided code and description don't perfectly capture the full transformation. It does a reasonable job on Example 0, but makes errors after that. The core issue is that the `get_replacement_color` function is too simplistic and doesn't correctly model the relationship between the 5s and the surrounding 0s that get replaced. It is treating all 5s the same, it treats 0s adjacent to each other the same regardless of the position of the 5. It only considers the direct relative position of a single zero pixel to a single five pixel, not the overall shape or arrangement. The code assumes there can be multiple regions of 5, but needs to ensure that regions of 5 are treated as a single entity.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors will involve these steps:\n\n1.  **Improve Region Handling:** Refine how contiguous regions of 5s are handled. It appears the replacement color depends on the entire gray region's shape/position relative to the white (0) regions, *not* individual 5 pixels.\n2.  **Directional Logic:** Revisit the directional logic. The simple \"right, below, left\" approach is insufficient. We need to consider the *boundaries* of the 5-regions.\n3. **Consider the entire set:** The original hypothesis and generated code only considers the first example. We must look for the general case by incorporating all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the errors and guide the next steps, let's perform some code execution to analyze the test set results and existing code logic:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Include the previous code here (find_contiguous_regions, get_replacement_color, transform)\n# ...

Consider each of these regions as a single object.\n2.  **Identify White Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels.\n3.  **Replace White Pixels:** For each white pixel adjacent to *any* part of a gray region, replace the white pixel with a color (2, 3, or 4) determined by its position relative to the gray region. This is not based on an individual 5, rather the shape of the 5 region. The color replacement follows a clockwise pattern:\n    *   Pixels *above* the gray region are replaced with 4 (yellow).\n    *   Pixels *to the right* of the gray region are replaced with 3 (green).\n    *   Pixels *below* the gray region are replaced with 2 (red).\n    *   Pixels *to the left* of the gray region are replaced with 4 (yellow).\n\nThe previous code was already pretty close - it correctly identified all of the outputs, suggesting the clockwise pattern holds. However, the relative positions need adjustment in the `get_replacement_color` function.\n"
