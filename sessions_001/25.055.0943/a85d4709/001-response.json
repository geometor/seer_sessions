The input grid contains only the values 0 and 5, which correspond to white and gray, respectively. The output grid contains the values 2, 3, and 4, which represents red, green, and yellow, respectively. The positions of cells are preserved during the transformation; that is, a cell at a specific row and column in the input grid maps directly to the same row and column in the output grid. The transformation appears to be a mapping or substitution of colors/values with a consistent scheme.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
