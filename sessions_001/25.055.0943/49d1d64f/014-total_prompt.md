## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 1 4
8 0 2
3 2 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE7792D0>

**output:**
```
0 2 1 4 0
2 2 1 4 4
8 8 0 2 2
3 3 2 8 8
0 3 2 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7297AE9CAAA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored squares (represented by single-digit integers) into a 5x5 grid. The colors in the original grid appear to be replicated and expanded outwards in the output grid. The central pixel of the input grid remains singular, acting as the center of the output grid, while all other pixels are duplicated both horizontally and vertically.  The edges are mirrored. The colors themselves don't change; only their spatial arrangement does.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - relation: spatial_expansion
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: Each pixel in the input, except the center, expands to a 2x2 block in the output.
  - relation: center_preservation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The central pixel of the input grid remains a single pixel at the center of the output grid.
  - relation: color_preservation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description:  The color value of each pixel is unchanged during the transformation.
  - observation: edge_mirroring
    description: Pixels at the edges of the input grid are mirrored at the edge of the larger output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Center:** Identify the central pixel of the input grid (at coordinates (1,1) for a 3x3 grid, using 0-based indexing).

2.  **Center Placement:** Place the value of the central pixel from the input grid into the central position of the output grid (coordinates (2,2) for a 5x5 grid).

3.  **Iterate Input:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid *except* the central pixel.

4.  **Pixel Expansion:** For each non-central input pixel:
    *   Create a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.
    *   Populate all four pixels in the 2x2 block with the color value of the current input pixel.
    *   Determine start position for 2x2 block: input pixel row \* 2 = output row start, input pixel column \* 2 = output column start.

5. **Edge Mirroring**: Copy pixels at the very edge of the input grid and mirror them outwards at the edges of the output grid. Specifically:
    * top row of the input becomes row 0 and 1 in the output.
    * bottom row of the input becomes row 3 and 4 in the output.
    * left most column of the input becomes column 0 and 1 of the output.
    * right most column of the input becomes column 3 and 4 of the output.

In Summary: The transformation expands the input grid by duplicating each non-central pixel into a 2x2 block while preserving the central pixel. The original grid is effectively "inflated" around its center and mirrored at the edges, with color values maintained throughout.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
