The input grid seems to define core elements that are then expanded upon in the output. Colors (represented by digits) in the input grid are preserved and seem to influence the structure of the larger output grid. There is an introduction of '0' (white) colored pixels around and within the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically, add one row above and below the input grid dimensions and increase the width by two.\n2.  **Padding border:** Add a border of '0' (white) pixels around the expanded region where the input will be placed. The padding should be one pixel.\n3.  **Copy and Expand:** Copy each element from the input grid to the output grid. Expand as follows:\n    *   Copy the top row of the input into the output, bordered by white pixels\n    *   duplicate the top row of the input and add under the top row, mirroring each pixel\n    *   Copy the bottom row of the input grid to output grid, under the duplicated input top row.\n    *  duplicate the bottom row of the input and add under it, mirroring each pixel, padding left and right with white.\n\nThis program describes how to take the small input grid, expand its dimensions, apply white pixel padding, copy the input elements to create an initial central block.\n"
