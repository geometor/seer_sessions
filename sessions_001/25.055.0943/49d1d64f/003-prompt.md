Previous Code:
```python
"""
Replicate each pixel in the 2x2 input grid into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
Then, add a white (value 0) border around the resulting 4x4 grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def replicate_pixel(grid, row, col, output_grid):
    """Replicates a single pixel into a 2x2 block."""
    value = grid[row, col]
    output_grid[2*row:2*row+2, 2*col:2*col+2] = value
    return output_grid

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the replication and bordering rule."""
    # Initialize output_grid as a 4x4 grid filled with zeros (white).
    output_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)

    # Replicate each pixel of the input grid.
    for row in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for col in range(input_grid.shape[1]):

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
