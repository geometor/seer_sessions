Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a limited understanding from the first example. It correctly identified the padding and the duplication of rows, but it failed to accurately capture the mirroring/expansion logic. It assumes the input is always 2 rows and applies a hard-coded transformation that won't generalize. The core issue is that the code isn't dynamically adapting to the input grid's dimensions and content, specifically, the mirroring aspect. We need a strategy that accounts for input grid of variable sizes, and copies each row and then mirrors, as the output shows both.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Dimensions:** Modify the code to calculate output dimensions based on input dimensions, but correctly, accounting for expansion in all four directions.
2.  **Iterative Copying and Mirroring:** Instead of hardcoding row operations, use loops to iterate through the input rows and columns, copying them to the output grid and performing the mirror operation.
3.  **Correct Mirroring**: Each row from input should create an output row, then immediately below, another output row that is a copy.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the transformations, let's use code execution to analyze each input/output pair. I'll focus on dimensions, unique colors, and any immediately apparent patterns.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    output_shape = output_grid.shape
    input_unique_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
    output_unique_colors = np.unique(output_grid)
    print(f"  Input Shape: {input_shape}")
    print(f"  Output Shape: {output_shape}")
    print(f"  Input Unique Colors: {input_unique_colors}")
    print(f"  Output Unique Colors: {output_unique_colors}")

task_data = {
    "train": [
        {
            "input": [[8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8]],
            "output": [[0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0]],
        },
        {
            "input": [[6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6], [6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6]],
            "output": [
                [0, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0],
                [0, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0],
                [0, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0],
                [0, 6, 6, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0],
            ],
        },
        {
            "input": [[7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7]],
            "output": [
                [0, 7, 7, 7, 0],
                [0, 7, 7, 7, 0],
                [0, 7, 7, 7, 0],
                [0, 7, 7, 7, 0],
                [0, 7, 7, 7, 0],
            ],
        },
        {
            "input": [[4, 4], [4, 4], [4, 4], [4, 4]],
            "output": [
                [0, 4, 4, 0],
                [0, 4, 4, 0],
                [0, 4, 4, 0],
                [0, 4, 4, 0],
                [0, 4, 4, 0],
                [0, 4, 4, 0],
            ],
        },
    ]
}

for i, example in enumerate(task_data["train"]):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    analyze_example(np.array(example["input"]), np.array(example["output"]))

```

```
Example 1:
  Input Shape: (2, 3)
  Output Shape: (4, 5)
  Input Unique Colors: [8]
  Output Unique Colors: [0 8]
Example 2:
  Input Shape: (2, 6)
  Output Shape: (4, 8)
  Input Unique Colors: [6 8]
  Output Unique Colors: [0 6 8]
Example 3:
  Input Shape: (3, 3)
  Output Shape: (5, 5)
  Input Unique Colors: [7]
  Output Unique Colors: [0 7]
Example 4:
  Input Shape: (4, 2)
  Output Shape: (6, 4)
  Input Unique Colors: [4]
  Output Unique Colors: [0 4]
```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      shape: variable
      colors: variable_integers
      type: 2d_array

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      shape: derived_from_input
      height: input_height + 2
      width: input_width + 2
      colors: input_colors + [0] # 0 is always present in the output as padding.
      type: 2d_array

  - action: pad
    agent: system
    target: output_grid
    details:
      color: 0
      location: all_edges

  - action: copy
    agent: system
    source: input_grid
    destination: output_grid
    details: Each row of the input grid is duplicated.

  - action: duplicate
    agent: system
    source: input_rows
    destination: output_grid, immediately_below
    details: each row is copied, then copied again immediately below.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Create a new, empty output grid. The height of the output grid is the height of the input grid plus 2. The width of the output grid is the width of the input grid plus 2.
2.  **Pad with White:** Fill the entire output grid with white pixels (color 0).
3.  **Iterate and Duplicate Rows**: For each row in the input grid:
    *   Copy the row from the input grid into the output grid, starting one row down and one column to the right (to account for the white border).
    *   Copy this same row *again* immediately below the row just copied.

This program avoids hardcoding and focuses on the dynamic relationship between input and output.
