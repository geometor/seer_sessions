            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the initial code output to develop a robust natural language program and refine the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code provides basic analysis, printing shapes and unique colors of input/output pairs. This helps to frame the problem, but doesn't describe the transformation itself. The examples clearly show a consistent pattern: the input grid is being expanded by adding a border of black (0) pixels. The output grid is always larger than the input, and the original input grid's content appears to be centered within the new, larger grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Pattern Consistency:** Verify that the \"add a black border\" rule applies to all training examples. The printed output confirms this.\n2.  **Determine Border Size:** Calculate the added border's thickness on each side (top/bottom, left/right). It appears to always be a one-pixel border.\n3.  **Formalize the rule:** Express the transformation as a precise natural language program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from code execution):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 5)\n    *   Input Unique Colors: \\[8]\n    *   Output Unique Colors: \\[0 8]\n    * border added to all sides\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 8)\n    *   Input Unique Colors: \\[6 8]\n    *   Output Unique Colors: \\[0 6 8]\n    * border added to all sides\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Input Unique Colors: \\[7]\n    *   Output Unique Colors: \\[0 7]\n    * border added to all sides\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 2)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 4)\n    *   Input Unique Colors: \\[4]\n    *   Output Unique Colors: \\[0 4]\n    * border added to all sides\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The output grid is always larger than the input grid.\n  - observation: |\n      The output grid contains all the colors of the input grid, plus black (0).\n  - observation: |\n    The input grid contents appear centered in output grid.\n  - rule: |\n      A border of black (0) pixels is added to all sides of the input grid.\n  - border_thickness: |\n       The border thickness is one pixel on all sides (top, bottom, left, right).\n  - input_object: The entire input grid.\n  - output_object: The expanded grid with a black border.\n  - action: Enlarge input grid by adding border.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Take** the input grid.\n2.  **Create** a new, larger grid filled with black (color 0) pixels. The new grid's dimensions should be calculated by adding 2 to both the height and width of the input grid (adding one pixel border on each side).\n3.  **Copy** the contents of the original input grid into the center of the new grid. Specifically, the top-left corner of the input grid should be placed at position (1, 1) in the output grid (where (0, 0) is the top-leftmost position).\n4.  **Return** the new grid\n"
