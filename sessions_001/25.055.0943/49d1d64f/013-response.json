            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored squares (represented by single-digit integers) into a 5x5 grid. The colors in the original grid appear to be replicated and expanded outwards in the output grid. The central pixel of the input grid remains singular, acting as the center of the output grid, while all other pixels are duplicated both horizontally and vertically.  The edges are mirrored. The colors themselves don't change; only their spatial arrangement does.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically:\n    * top row of the input becomes row 0 and 1 in the output.\n    * bottom row of the input becomes row 3 and 4 in the output.\n    * left most column of the input becomes column 0 and 1 of the output.\n    * right most column of the input becomes column 3 and 4 of the output.\n\nIn Summary: The transformation expands the input grid by duplicating each non-central pixel into a 2x2 block while preserving the central pixel. The original grid is effectively \"inflated\" around its center and mirrored at the edges, with color values maintained throughout.\n"
