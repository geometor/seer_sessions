## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 0 8
0 8 0
8 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7297AE179000>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7297AE17AE90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. The grid contains two colors: azure (8) and white (0).  The output is a single number, in this case, '2', in a red background. The number might represent a count, property, or result of some calculation from input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [1,1], [2,0], [2,2]]
      - color: white
        value: 0
        positions: [[0,1], [1,0], [1,2], [2,1]]
  - type: scalar
    value: 2
    color: red

relationships:
  - type: count
    description: The output scalar might represent a count of specific elements in the input grid.

actions:
 - type: transformation
   description: converts input of a 3x3 grid and outputs number of objects.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input is a 3x3 grid. Within the grid, identify contiguous regions of the same color as distinct objects.
2.  **Count Objects:** Count the number of azure (8) colored objects. Azure color pixels are on the diagonals. If white pixels break the contiguity of azure pixels in their row or column, then count each azure set of pixels as individual object.
3.  **Output:** The output is the number of these identified objects. The output presented here is `2`.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
