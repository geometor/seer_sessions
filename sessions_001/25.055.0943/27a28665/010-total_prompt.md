Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input is a 3x3 grid. Within the grid, identify contiguous regions of the same color as distinct objects.
Count the number of azure (8) colored objects. Azure color pixels are on the diagonals. If white pixels break the contiguity
of azure pixels in their row or column, then count each azure set of pixels as individual object.
The output is the number of these identified objects presented in red color.
"""

import numpy as np

def count_objects(grid, color):
    # Count the number of distinct objects of a specified color in the grid.
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    count = 0

    def is_valid(r, c):
        # check bounds
        return 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]

        visited[r, c] = True

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a single example and focused on counting contiguous azure regions. While this worked for the first training example, it fails to generalize to other examples in the training set. The core issue is that the initial program oversimplified the conditions for counting azure objects. The presence of white pixels breaking contiguity isn't the only rule governing whether azure pixels are counted as separate objects. The examples and test results shows that the objects are counted based on diagonal contiguity only.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The primary assumption that azure objects are defined solely by contiguity needs revision. The results suggest a more complex rule involving diagonal relationships.
2.  **Focus on Diagonals:** Explicitly incorporate the concept of diagonal contiguity in the object identification logic.
3.  **Refine Object Definition:** Clearly define what constitutes an "azure object" in terms of diagonal connectivity, rather than just any contiguous region.
4.  **Iterative Adjustment:** Update the natural language program and subsequently the code, testing against all examples after each adjustment.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, the expected output, the actual output from the previous code, and observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[8, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0], [8, 0, 8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[2]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[2]]`
    *   Observation: Correct. The initial program works for this case. Two distinct diagonal azure objects.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[3]]`
    *   Observation: Incorrect. The code counts each azure pixel as separate object. It is not considering diagonal contiguity. The correct answer contains one continuous azure line across the grid diagonal.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 8], [0, 8, 0], [8, 0, 0]]`
    *    Expected Output: `[[1]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[3]]`
    *   Observation: Incorrect. Similar to example 2, the code fails to recognize the diagonal connectivity, and counted each azure pixel as an individual object.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
  - property: diagonal_contiguity
    description: Azure pixels form an object if connected diagonally.
  - property: count
    description: The number of diagonally contiguous azure objects.

actions:
  - name: count_diagonal_objects
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      - color: azure (8)
    output: object_count
  - create_output_grid:
      input: object_count
      output: 1x1 grid
      description: creates a 1x1 grid representing object_count

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Examine the input grid and locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure).
2.  **Check for Diagonal Connectivity:** Determine if the azure pixels are connected diagonally. Diagonally connected azure pixels are considered a single object.
3. **Count distinct diagonal azure groups**: Each set of diagonally connected pixels represent one object.
4.  **Create Output:** Create a 1x1 output grid. The single cell in this grid will contain the count of the distinct, diagonally contiguous azure objects, represented as a single digit.

This revised natural language program now accurately captures the transformation rule, addressing the diagonal contiguity aspect highlighted by the test results.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
