Each object is a 2x1 vertical rectangle. There are also background cells that are color 0.\n\n2.  **Locate Key Positions:**\n    *   The first azure rectangle starts at row 1, column 1.\n    *   The second azure rectangle starts at row 3, column 5.\n\n3. **Observe changes:** The azure rectangles remain unchanged. Two blue cells are added next to each of them.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** For each of the two azure (8) colored 2x1 rectangles, add the value '1' to the right of the top cell of the vertical rectangle and another one '1' before the bottom cell of the rectangle.\n\nIn summary, the rule involves keeping the existing 2 x 1 azure rectangles and adding new blue (1) cell to the right of their top cells, and a blue (1) cell before their bottom cell.\n"
