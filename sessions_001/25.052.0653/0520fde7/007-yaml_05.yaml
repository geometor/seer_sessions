task: 006
observations:
  - object_types:
      - gray_line:
        color: 5
        shape: line # It's always a vertical line of gray pixels.
      - red_pixel:
        color: 2
        shape: single pixel
  - input_features:
      - gray_line_position:
        description: "The vertical position of the gray line seems irrelevant; only its existence matters."
      - surrounding_colors:
        description: "Colors surrounding the gray line vary but don't seem to directly affect the core transformation (see notes below)."
  - output_features:
      - red_pixel_placement:
        description: "Placement of red pixels in a 3x3 grid, seemingly based on a spiral or clockwise pattern, possibly with variations."
  - transformation_rules:
    - rule_1: "If a gray line exists, place red pixels in a 3x3 grid."
    - rule_2: "The exact placement pattern of the red pixels needs to be determined; it appears to vary."
  - notes:
      - "The initial assumption of different placement rules based on surrounding colors (blue/white) was incorrect."
      - "The gray line's existence triggers the 3x3 red pixel pattern, but the precise pattern has sub-variations."
