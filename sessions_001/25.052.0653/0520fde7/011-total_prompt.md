```python
"""
The transformation rule creates a 3x3 output grid. The output grid is initialized with all white pixels (0).
Red pixels (2) are placed in a clockwise pattern, skipping one cell between placements. The starting point
and number of skips before the first placement vary depending on the specific input pattern. The presence
of a vertical gray line (5) in the input is a consistent feature, but its direct influence on the red pixel
placement is not deterministic; rather, it seems to act as a contextual clue.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
