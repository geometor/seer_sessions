Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Gray Object:** Locate the contiguous gray (color 5) areas in the input grid. This forms the basis of the transformation.
2.  **Change Gray to Azure:** All instances of gray (color 5) are changed to azure (color 8).
3.  **Change central-connected pixels to Red:** Inside the azure areas, if a pixel originally colored gray (5) had four neighbors that were also gray (up, down, left, right, orthogonal), it is changed to red (color 2). The resulting red pixels are adjacent to one another and form a connected object (component).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
