Copy all single-cell objects (red, blue, and magenta pixels) from their input locations to their corresponding output locations.\n2. Locate the red pixel. Add yellow pixels (color 4) above and below the red pixel, at positions where the row number is one less or one more than the red pixel's row, and the column is one less or one greater.\n3. Locate the blue pixel. Add orange pixels in the following manner.\n   * All locations where the row number is within the range [row-1,row+1] and column is equal to the column of the blue pixel, OR column number is within range [col-1,col+1] and row number is equal to the row of the blue pixel.\n"
