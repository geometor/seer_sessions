Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
input_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left edge
      count: 3
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: center
      count: 3
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right edge
      count: 3
output_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: left edge
      count: 3
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: center
      count: 3
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: right edge
      count: 3
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines, each a different color (green, blue, and red). Each occupies a single column.

2.  **Color Transformation**: Each color in the input is transformed to a different color in the output.
    *   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).
    *   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).
    *   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).

3. **Spatial Consistency**: The position and shape of the objects remain consistent. The vertical lines do not change their positions or extents.

**Natural Language program**

The transformation rule can be summarized by the following process. For each colored cell $c$ located at coordinate $(x,y)$, the output cell is defined by adding the integer 1 to the original color value.

```
output[x,y] = input[x,y] + 1
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
