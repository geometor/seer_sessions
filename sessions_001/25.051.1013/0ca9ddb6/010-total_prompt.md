Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (3, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (6, 6)
        shape: single cell
    background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (3, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (6, 6)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4, 1), (4, 3)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 7 (orange)
        positions: [(5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (6, 6), (6,7)]
        shape: L-shape + single cell
    background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** Locate the single red cell (color 2) and the single blue cell (color 1) in the input grid.

2.  **Red Cell Action:** The red cell remains in its original position. Two yellow cells are placed. The first is placed one row above and one column to the left. A second yellow cell, symmetrically to the first one, is placed one row above and one column to the right of the red one.

3.  **Blue Cell Action:** Around the blue cell, an L shape of orange cells is created. This L shape is immediately to the left, below, and right of the blue cell.

4. **Orange Cells Addition**: The orange cell on the right is mirrored by adding a symmetric cell on the left, one row above and one column to the left of the blue cell.

In summary: The transformation involves keeping the original red and blue cells and adding yellow cells relative to the red and adding orange cells to the left, below, and right of the blue cell. Then a final orange cell is added by mirroring, relative to the blue cell, one of the already available orange cells.

```python

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml

    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        position: (0, 3)

      - color: 2 (red)
        positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 1 (blue)
        positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
        shape: single cells
    background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
     - color: 8 (azure)
       position: (0, 3)
       shape: single cell
      - color: 2 (red)
        positions: [(2, 6), (7, 1)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 1 (blue)
        positions: [(3, 2), (6, 6)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (6,0), (6,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 7 (orange)
        positions: [(2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,6)]
        shape: L-shapes + single cells

    background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** Locate the single azure cell (color 8), the red cells (color 2) and the blue cells (color 1) in the input grid.

2.  **Azure Cell Action:** The azure cell remains in its original position.

3.  **Red Cell Action:** The red cells remain in their original positions. Two yellow cells are placed relative to *each* red cell. The first is placed one row above and one column to the left of the red cell. The second is placed one row above and one column to the right of the red cell.

4.  **Blue Cell Action:** Around *each* blue cell, an L shape of orange cells is created. This L shape is immediately to the left, below, and to the right of the blue cell.

5. **Orange Cells Addition**: An additional orange cell is placed by mirroring, relative to each blue cell, the orange cell at its right. That means one row above and one colum to the left of each blue cell.

In summary, this transformation generalizes the previous one. It keeps the single azure cell unchanged, and it applies the rules observed in the previous example to all red and blue cells: placing yellow cells relative to the red cells and orange cells around the blue cells.

```python
"""

    return output_grid
```
The code has been updated to correctly handle multiple red and blue cells, applying the transformation rules to each instance of these colored cells. The `find_object` function has been replaced with `find_objects` to return a list of all occurrences.

Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (2, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (7, 3)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        position: (5, 6)
        shape: single cell
    background_color: 0 (white)
  output_grid:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: (2, 2)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: (7, 3)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        position: (5,6)
        shape: single cell
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        positions: [(1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3)]
        shape: single cells
      - color: 7 (orange)
        positions: [ (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (7,3), (7,4)]
        shape: L-shape + single cell
    background_color: 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** Locate the single red cell (color 2), the single blue cell (color 1), and the single magenta cell (color 6) in the input grid.

2.  **Red Cell Action:** The red cell remains in its original position. Two yellow cells are placed relative to the red cell. The first yellow cell is placed one row above and one column to the left of the red cell. The second is placed one row above and one column to the right.

3.  **Blue Cell Action:** Around the blue cell, an L shape of orange cells is created. This L shape is immediately to the left, below, and right of the blue cell.

4.  **Orange Cells Addition**: An additional orange cell is placed by mirroring, relative to the blue cell, the cell placed at the right of the blue one. It is placed one row above and one colum to the left of the blue cell.

5.  **Magenta Cell Action:** The magenta cell remains in its original position and *no* new objects are generated relative to it.

In summary: The transformation *selectively* applies the rules observed before. It applies the red cell rule and the blue cell rule, while the magenta cell remains in place and has no associated actions.

The code written for the previous example should work correctly here, with no change.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
