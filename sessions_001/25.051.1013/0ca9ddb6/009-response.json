Two yellow cells are placed relative to the red cell. The first yellow cell is placed one row above and one column to the left of the red cell. The second is placed one row above and one column to the right.\n\n3.  **Blue Cell Action:** Around the blue cell, an L shape of orange cells is created. This L shape is immediately to the left, below, and right of the blue cell.\n\n4.  **Orange Cells Addition**: An additional orange cell is placed by mirroring, relative to the blue cell, the cell placed at the right of the blue one. It is placed one row above and one colum to the left of the blue cell.\n\n5.  **Magenta Cell Action:** The magenta cell remains in its original position and *no* new objects are generated relative to it.\n\nIn summary: The transformation *selectively* applies the rules observed before. It applies the red cell rule and the blue cell rule, while the magenta cell remains in place and has no associated actions.\n\nThe code written for the previous example should work correctly here, with no change.\n"
