Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task:



```yaml
facts:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - input_objects:
    - Two separate azure objects.
    - Object 1: A 2x1 vertical rectangle at (1,1) and (2,1).
    - Object 2: A 2x1 horizontal rectangle at (3,4) and (4,5).
  - output_objects:
    - Two azure objects of same dimension and location,
    - The color of 2 pixels are changed from azure to blue
  - color_changes:
    - (2,1) azure -> blue
    - (4,4) azure -> blue
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure colored objects within the input grid.
2.  **Describe object as a set of pixels and their locations**
3.  **Change the color of specific pixel to blue**
    Locate one pixel of that object that is at highest row, take the pixel at the top right.
4.  Copy the input to the output.
5. Change the color of the identified pixels to blue.

In summary: The transformation identifies two azure objects in the grid and in each object, replaces the most top right pixel to blue. The modified objects are then placed in the output grid, maintaining their original positions and other pixel colors.
