The tip is the single cell at one end of the L shape. For instance, with the first object with top left corner at (1,1), the tip is at (1,2). And at (1,2), the inserted blue cell is found. With the second L-shape object with the top left corner at (3,4), the tip is at (4,6), and in output, we can see a new blue cell at (4,5).\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n```\n1. Copy all L shapes of azure color from the input to the output\n2. For each L shape of azure color, find out their corresponding tip coordinates.\n3. Insert a blue cell at the found tip coordinate.\n```\n"
