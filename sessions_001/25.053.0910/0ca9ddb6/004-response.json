These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n\n2.  **Process Each Seed:** For each seed pixel:\n    *   **Preserve Original:** Keep the original seed pixel in the output grid at the same location and with the same color.\n\n3.  **Conditional Spawning:**\n        *   If the seed pixel is azure (8), spawn two yellow (4) pixels: one 2 steps right and 1 down, the second 4 steps right and 1 down.\n        *   If the seed pixel is red (2), spawn an orange (7) pixel: 4 steps to the left on the same row (if that position is outside of the grid, do not create it).\n        *   If the seed pixel is blue (1) and on an odd numbered row, create an orange (7) pixel to the left, and to the right. If on an even row, create an orange (7) one step above and below.\n        *   If the seed pixel is blue (1) and y > 5 and an even number, spawn yellow (4) at x=0 and x=2 on rows above and below seed.\n\n4.  **Boundaries:** Ensure new pixels do not go outside the bounds of the 9x9 grid.
