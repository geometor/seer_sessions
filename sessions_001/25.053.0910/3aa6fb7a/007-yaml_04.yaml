  observations:
    - "The input and output grids have the same dimensions."
    - "The azure pixels are in the same locations in both the input and output grids."
    - "Blue pixels are added to the output grid."
    - "Each blue pixel is added adjacent to an azure pixel"
    - "The blue pixels are added to existing empty (black=0) cells"
