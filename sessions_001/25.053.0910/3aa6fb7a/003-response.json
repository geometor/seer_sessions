            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies azure objects and attempts to place blue pixels relative to them. However, it fails to accurately determine the *top-left* and *bottom-right* azure objects specifically, and its placement logic for the blue pixels is inconsistent across examples. The core issue is the misinterpretation of \"top-left\" and \"bottom-right\" object selection, and the relative placement of new blue pixels to those identified objects.\n\nThe strategy will involve these steps:\n\n1.  **Improve Object Identification:** Modify the object finding logic to correctly identify *all* azure objects, and then determine which of these is the top-left and which is the bottom-right.\n2.  **Refine Blue Pixel Placement:** Clarify the placement rules for the blue pixels based on a more robust understanding of *relative* positioning. Instead of just looking at corners, we will find the bounding box of the relevant object, and apply relative offsets.\n3. **Iterative testing** test the updated program against each training case and revise\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** Two azure objects, one at the top-left and one at the bottom-right.\n*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels placed to the right of the top-left object and above the bottom-right object.\n*   **Actual Output:** Incorrect blue pixel placement. The code places too many blue pixels, and they're incorrectly placed in relation to the *overall* top-left and bottom-right.\n*   **Problems**: The code places blue pixels relative to each object and not the top-left and bottom-right.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Three azure objects.\n*   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels placed correctly relative to the top-left and bottom-right objects.\n*   **Actual Output:** Incorrect placement, similar issues to Example 1.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 002\n    examples:\n      - example_id: 1\n        objects:\n          - color: 8  # azure\n            shape: irregular\n            count: 2\n            top_left: True #only one should be.\n            bottom_right: True #only one should be.\n        actions:\n          - type: add_pixel\n            color: 1  # blue\n            relative_position:\n              - object: top_left_azure\n                location: right_of_top_row\n              - object: bottom_right_azure\n                location: above_top_left_corner\n\n      - example_id: 2\n        objects:\n          - color: 8  # azure\n            shape: irregular\n            count: 3\n            top_left: True #only one should be.\n            bottom_right: True #only one should be\n        actions:\n          - type: add_pixel\n            color: 1  # blue\n            relative_position:\n              - object: top_left_azure\n                location: right_of_top_row\n              - object: bottom_right_azure\n                location: above_top_left_corner\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find all Azure Objects:** Identify all distinct contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Top-Left and Bottom-Right Objects:**\n    *   The top-left object is the one whose top-most row is the highest (smallest row index). If multiple objects share the same top-most row, the one with the left-most column on that row (smallest column index) is the top-left.\n    *   The bottom-right object is the one whose bottom-most row is the lowest (largest row index). If multiple objects share the same bottom-most row, the one with the right-most column on that row (largest column index) is the bottom-right.\n3.  **Place Blue Pixel near Top-Left Object:** Find the right-most pixel on the top row of the top-left azure object. Place a blue (1) pixel immediately to the right of this pixel.\n4.  **Place Blue Pixel near Bottom-Right Object:** Find the top-left corner pixel of the bottom-right azure object. Place a blue (1) pixel immediately above this pixel.\n5. **Preserve Azure:** All azure pixels in original input are also in the output.\n6. **Output:** create a copy of the input, apply the new blue pixels, and return.\n"
