            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with an updated natural language program and a YAML block documenting the observations.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, capturing the basic idea of expanding colored regions. However, the results reveal a consistent error: the expansion is happening *around* the original colored pixels, but the original pixels themselves are not always maintained. The expansion is overwriting the original colors. The strategy to fix this is to prioritize maintaining the original colors and expand *only* into white (0) pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including where the errors occurred:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Issue:** The red (2) pixel was surrounded by yellow (4), and blue (1) by orange (7). However the core pixels of red and blue where not maintained.\n    *    pixels off: 8\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Issue:** Similar to Example 1, the original red (2) and blue (1) pixels are being overwritten by the expansion colors, and expansion seems to stop at incorrect colors.\n    *    pixels off: 16\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Issue:** Same issue as Examples 1 and 2. The Red overwrites, the blue overwrites, and the magenta is not impacted.\n        *    pixels off: 8\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 018\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - {color: 2, shape: single_pixel, position: [3, 2]}\n      - {color: 1, shape: single_pixel, position: [6, 6]}\n    output_objects:\n      - {color: 2, shape: single_pixel, position: [3, 2]}\n      - {color: 4, shape: cross, positions: [[2, 2], [3, 1], [3, 3], [4,2]]}\n      - {color: 1, shape: single_pixel, position: [6, 6]}\n      - {color: 7, shape: cross, positions: [[5, 6], [6, 5], [6, 7], [7,6]]}\n    transformations:\n      - expand: {from_color: 2, to_color: 4, shape: cross}\n      - expand: {from_color: 1, to_color: 7, shape: cross}\n\n  - id: 2\n    input_objects:\n        - {color: 8, shape: single_pixel, position: [0,3]}\n        - {color: 2, shape: single_pixel, position: [2, 6]}\n        - {color: 1, shape: single_pixel, position: [3, 2]}\n        - {color: 2, shape: single_pixel, position: [7, 1]}\n        - {color: 1, shape: single_pixel, position: [6, 6]}\n    output_objects:\n        - {color: 8, shape: single_pixel, position: [0,3]}\n        - {color: 2, shape: single_pixel, position: [2, 6]}\n        - {color: 4, shape: cross, positions: [[1,6], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3,6]]}\n        - {color: 1, shape: single_pixel, position: [3, 2]}\n        - {color: 7, shape: cross, positions: [[2, 2], [3, 1], [3, 3], [4,2]]}\n        - {color: 2, shape: single_pixel, position: [7, 1]}\n        - {color: 4, shape: cross, positions: [[6, 1], [7, 0], [7, 2], [8, 1]]}\n        - {color: 1, shape: single_pixel, position: [6, 6]}\n        - {color: 7, shape: cross, positions: [[5, 6], [6, 5], [6, 7], [7,6]]}\n    transformations:\n      - expand: {from_color: 2, to_color: 4, shape: cross}\n      - expand: {from_color: 1, to_color: 7, shape: cross}\n\n  - id: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - {color: 2, shape: single_pixel, position: [2, 2]}\n      - {color: 6, shape: single_pixel, position: [5, 6]}\n      - {color: 1, shape: single_pixel, position: [7, 3]}\n    output_objects:\n      - {color: 2, shape: single_pixel, position: [2, 2]}\n      - {color: 4, shape: cross, positions: [[1, 2], [2, 1], [2, 3], [3,2]]}\n      - {color: 6, shape: single_pixel, position: [5, 6]}\n      - {color: 1, shape: single_pixel, position: [7, 3]}\n      - {color: 7, shape: cross, positions: [[6, 3], [7, 2], [7, 4], [8,3]]}\n    transformations:\n      - expand: {from_color: 2, to_color: 4, shape: cross}\n      - expand: {from_color: 1, to_color: 7, shape: cross}\n      - expand: {from_color: 6, to_color: null, shape: null}\n\n```\n\n**Updated Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Original Colored Pixels:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. Note the color and position of any non-white pixels.\n2.  **Preserve Original Colors:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.  This ensures all original non-white pixels are maintained.\n3.  **Conditional Expansion:** For each *white* (0) pixel in the output grid:\n    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right, but *not* diagonally).\n    *   If a neighbor is red (2), change the white pixel to yellow (4).\n    *   If a neighbor is blue (1), change the white pixel to orange (7).\n    *   If a neighbor is magenta(6) do nothing.\n4. Output the final grid\n\nKey Changes and Clarifications:\n\n*   **Preservation of Original Colors:** The core change is to start with a copy of the input and *only* change white pixels.\n*   **Order of Operations:** It's crucial to check for white pixels *first* and *then* check their neighbors.  This prevents overwriting original colors.\n*   **Specificity:** The description is now very precise about which pixels are checked and changed.\n*   **Magenta:** No expansion is observed, so no rule.\n"
