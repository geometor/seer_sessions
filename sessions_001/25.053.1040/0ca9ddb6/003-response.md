Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with an updated natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and generated code have several shortcomings, as evidenced by the mismatches in the test results. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly implement the 2x2 and 3x3 surround logic, and boundary conditions. The surround for red(2) expands only to the top, left, bottom, and right. It should form a 2x2 square including the origin pixel. The logic for the orange (7) surround around blue (1) is correct. The background preservation logic is not explicitly handled but is implied by modifying a copy of the input. There are off-by-one errors.

The strategy to resolve these errors involves:

1.  **Correcting Surround Logic:** Modify the code to ensure a proper 2x2 yellow square around the red pixel and a 3x3 orange square around the blue pixel.
2.  **Addressing Boundary Conditions:** The code does not handle edges of grid and writing beyond the edge of the array.
3.  **Refining the Natural Language Program:** Update the description to be more precise about the shapes and sizes of the surrounds.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Red pixel (2) at (3, 2).
    *   Blue pixel (1) at (6, 6).
    *   Errors: Yellow surround is not a 2x2 square.
    *   Pixels Off: 13

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Red pixel (2) at (2, 6), (7,1)
    *   Blue pixel (1) at (3, 2), (6,6)
    *    Errors: Yellow surround not 2x2. Blue surround overlaps the red, but red does not exist in output.
    *   Pixels Off: 21

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Red pixel (2) at (2, 2).
    *   Blue pixel (1) at (7, 3).
    *   Other colors are present, but should not be in output.
    *   Errors: Yellow surround not 2x2.
    *   Pixels Off: 13

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: red
    value: 2
    properties:
      surround:
        shape: square
        size: 2x2
        color: yellow
        value: 4

  - type: pixel
    color: blue
    value: 1
    properties:
      surround:
        shape: square
        size: 3x3
        color: orange
        value: 7

  - type: background
    color: white
    value: 0
    properties: {} # Background pixels remain unchanged

actions:
 - find_pixel:
    input: color value
    behavior: locate all pixels with color
 - create_surround:
    input: pixel, size, surround_color
    behavior: Replace pixels around the target pixel with the specified surround color, forming specified square.
 - preserve_background:
   input: all pixels except to change
   behavior: Retain their original color.

```

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate Key Pixels:** Identify all red pixels (value '2') and blue pixels (value '1') within the input grid.

2.  **Create 2x2 Yellow Surrounds:** For each red pixel:
    *   Create a 2x2 square of yellow (value '4') pixels.
    *   The red pixel should be one of the four in the square.

3.  **Create 3x3 Orange Surrounds:** For each blue pixel:
    *   Create a 3x3 square of orange (value '7') pixels.
    *   The blue pixel will be at the center of this 3x3 square.

4. **Preserve Background:** Ensure all other pixels that are not part of the yellow or orange surrounds retain their original colors (in the task, the background is white '0'). The output should only contain values of 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7.

5. **Overlapping surrounds** The output should not contain the original red and blue pixels. They should be replaced by the surround.
