Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the red pixel (value '2') and the blue pixel (value '1') within the input grid.

2.  **Create Yellow Surround:** For the red pixel, replace the four pixels that share edges with it with the color yellow (value '4'). Ensure that the newly formed yellow area becomes a 2 X 2 box with one corner as the red pixel.

3.  **Create Orange Surround:** For the blue pixel, replace the eight pixels surrounding it (including diagonals) with the color orange (value '7'). Ensure that the newly formed orange color occupies a 3 X 3 box and the blue pixel is at the center.

4.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the above transformations should remain unchanged (retain their original color, which is white '0').

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
