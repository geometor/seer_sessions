The two 8s stack.\n    *   The maroon (9) cell moves to the lowest available row in its column.\n    *   All other colored cells remain in their original positions.\n\n**Transformation Rule Summary**\nNon-zero colored objects are moved down to the lowest available position in their respective columns, maintaining their color and x-coordinate. The previous program can produce this output. If there is a stack of objects of the same color they are grouped.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nNon-zero colored objects are moved down to the lowest available position in their respective columns, maintaining their color and x-coordinate.
