Stack the objects by column, maintaining its original order. The existing python program correctly performs this transformation, so no changes are required.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation involves moving all non-zero colored cells to the lowest\navailable row in their respective columns while maintaining their original\ncolor and x-coordinate.
