            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this second example.\n\n**YAML Summary of Observations**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 005\ninput_grid:\n  size: 3x3\n  objects:\n    - color: 2\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: left column\n    - color: 3\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: middle column\n    - color: 8\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: right column\noutput_grid:\n  size: 3x3\n  objects:\n    - color: 6\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: left column\n    - color: 4\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: middle column\n    - color: 9\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      position: right column\ntransformation_rule:\n  description: Each vertical line of a specific color in the input grid is transformed into a vertical line of a different, corresponding color in the output grid. The spatial arrangement (left, middle, right columns) remains the same, indicating a consistent color mapping.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program: Step-by-step Transformation**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of three distinct vertical lines. Each line occupies a single column and is of a uniform color.  These are the primary objects.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping:** The transformation involves a color substitution. The mapping is:\n    *   Input color 2 (left column) becomes output color 6.\n    *   Input color 3 (middle column) becomes output color 4.\n    *   Input color 8 (right column) becomes output color 9.\n\n3.  **Spatial Preservation:** The positions and shapes (vertical lines) of the objects are maintained.  Each object in the input has a direct, spatially corresponding counterpart in the output. No objects are created or disappear; they maintain their shape and size. Only their color changes.\n\n4. **Complete Description**: The input grid consists of three vertical lines of colors 2, 3, and 8. The output grid has the same structure but substitutes each input color with a distinct color.\n\nThis transformation, like the first example, relies on a consistent color mapping while preserving spatial structure. It is a different mapping, but the principle is the same.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe input grid consists of three vertical lines of colors 2, 3, and 8.\nThe output grid has the same structure but substitutes each input color\nwith a distinct color according to the following mapping: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by applying a color mapping while preserving\n    the spatial structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Define the color mapping\n    color_map = {\n        2: 6,\n        3: 4,\n        8: 9\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through the input grid and apply the color mapping\n    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n            if input_grid[i, j] in color_map:\n                output_grid[i, j] = color_map[input_grid[i, j]]\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
