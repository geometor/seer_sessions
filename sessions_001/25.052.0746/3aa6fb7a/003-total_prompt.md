The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify two azure (8) colored "L" shaped objects (2x2 blocks with one cell removed). One is positioned at the top-left and the other at the bottom-right of the grid.
2. Change the color of the cell immediately to the right of the top-left object to blue (1).
3. Change the color of the cell immediately to the left of the bottom-right object to blue (1).

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
