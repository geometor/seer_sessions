example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: 2x2 square
        pixel_count: 4
  output:
    objects:
      - color: blue
        shape: 1x1 square
        pixel_count: 1
  rule_observation: "Even number of yellow pixels leads to a blue output."

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: red
        shape: discontinuous
        pixel_count: 4
      - color: yellow
        shape: discontinuous
        pixel_count: 3
  output:
    objects:
      - color: white
        shape: 1x1 square
        pixel_count: 1
  rule_observation: "Even number of red pixels AND odd number of yellow pixels leads to a white output."

example_3:
  input:
    objects:

        shape: discontinuous
        pixel_count: 3
      - color: red
        shape: discontinuous
        pixel_count: 4

    objects:
      - color: blue

  rule_observation: "Even number of red pixels AND odd number of yellow pixels leads to a blue output."
