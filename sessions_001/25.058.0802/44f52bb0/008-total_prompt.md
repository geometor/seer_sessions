## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73EB5950>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x71BF74101DB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing numerical values (which represent colors). The dominant colors are white (0) and red (2).
*   **Output:** A single numerical value (7), displayed within what appears to be a 1x1 grid filled with orange.
*   The input grid seems to contain a pattern: red (2) pixels are along a diagonal and the first column.
*    The output is not in the input, so must be computed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
    properties:
      - description: Contains a diagonal and partial column of red pixels.

  - object: output_value
    type: single_value
    value: 7
    color: orange

  - relation: input_to_output
    type: computation
    description: The output value is likely derived by a calculation performed on the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Add** the number of red pixels to four, ie `count_of_red + 4`
3.  **Result:** The output is the final sum.

**Reasoning**

The output seems to not have any direct representation on the input. It must computed by counting the number of pixels. Orange is color 7, so a simple count would not be a good program. But since there are 3 red pixels, and 3 + 4 = 7, it might be that the color is computed using addition.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
