## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73D1FBB0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x71BF73D1EC10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numerical values) into a single-pixel output, also represented by a number. The input grid is 3x3, and the output is a 1x1 grid (a single value). The primary colors involved are white (0) and red (2). The output is blue (1). It appears that the transformation involves some form of summarization or counting related to the input grid's colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 1x1 grid (single value).
  - data_point: Input grid contains white (0) and red (2) pixels.
  - data_point: Output grid contains a blue (1) pixel.
  - object_type: Input_Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 2]
  - object_type: Output_Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 1x1
      colors: [1]
  - relationship: count_red_objects_and_set_blue_output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count Objects:** Count the number of distinct red (2) objects in the input grid. An "object" is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Output:** Return '1', colored blue.

In essence, the program counts separate red objects, and always returns a blue '1'.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
