## Example 6

**input:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73D1FBB0>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x71BF74323B10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values (0 and 2). The output is a single numerical value (7). The colors in the visual representation correspond to the numerical values in the grid (0 is white, 2 is red). The output's visual representation seems to fill the whole space with a single color (orange, corresponding to 7).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - type: scalar
    value: 7
    color: orange

actions:
  - type: count_color
    input: grid
    parameters:
      color: red
    output: count_of_red_pixels

  - type: transform
    input: count_of_red_pixels
    logic:  add_to_background_count # add number to background count
    output: scalar

relationships:
  - input_grid_elements_to_output_scalar: "The output scalar seems to be related to something about the non-zero pixels in the input grid, probably a count related to their quantity and a value representing background"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.
2.  **Background value:** define a fixed value for the "background", for example, a white pixel has a value of zero, therefore the value is the color value.
3.  **Transform** Add the count of red pixels, to the value for the background multiplied by the total area of the grid,
4.  **Output:** The final result represents the output, which should have color that maps to that value.

In this specific instance:

*   There are three red pixels.
*   The background color is white, with a value of `0`. There are 9 total pixels
*    `3 + 0 * (9)` is not equal to the output of `7`

Let's reconsider the background value:

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.
2.  **Background value:** Perhaps, a better concept is that of "other": the background is the part of the grid *other* than the identified object, in this instance the "red pixels". The value for other is the sum of all the pixels, of a color *other* than that of the idenfitied object.
3.  **Transform** The count of red pixels (3) is added to the background value *other*. The value is derived from a constant value x * number of pixels. *other* pixels have value of 0, and number is 6.
4. `value = 3 + x * 6`. `value = 7` where x, the multipler for the "other" pixels = (7 - 3)/6 = 4 / 6, or 2/3. This is not an integer, so not consistent.

Alternative strategy:
1. **Count:** Count the number of red pixels.
2. **Background value:** The value of "other" is the constant added to the pixel count to reach the output value.
3. The other value is `7-3 = 4`. The question is what determines `4`. In this case, 4 is a count of specific *other* pixels, in this instance, the 4 white pixels in the 4 corners of the grid.

Final strategy:

1.  **Count Red:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.
2.  **Count corners** Count the number of white pixels (value = 0) that are in the corners.
3.  **Transform:** Add those two counts.
4.  **Output:** The result is the final output value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
