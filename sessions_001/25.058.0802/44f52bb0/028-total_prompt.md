Previous Code:
```python
"""
Examine the input grid and identify all cells that do not contain the value 0 (white).
If all non-zero cells in the InputGrid have the same value, the output is the next color in the sequence.
Sequence: `0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon`

import numpy as np

def get_next_color(color):
    """Gets the next color in the sequence, wrapping around if necessary."""
    return (color + 1) % 10

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule."""

    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    non_zero_values = input_array[input_array != 0]

    # Check if there are any non-zero values.
    if non_zero_values.size == 0:

        output_value = 1
    elif np.all(non_zero_values == non_zero_values[0]):
        # If all non-zero values are the same, output the next color in the sequence.
        output_value = get_next_color(non_zero_values[0])
    else:
        # Handle cases with different values, defaults to output color 1 (blue).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a simple rule: find all non-zero pixels, and if they all have the same color, output the next color in the sequence. Otherwise, output blue. This rule worked for the first example, but it's clearly not the complete rule, as evidenced by failures in subsequent examples. We need to carefully examine the input-output pairs where the code failed to understand what additional conditions or alternative rules are at play. The current strategy assumes a 1x1 output, which must also be validated.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to:

1.  **Analyze Failed Examples:** Carefully compare the input and output grids of the failing examples. Look for patterns that the current rule misses. Are there specific shapes, arrangements, or colors that trigger different behaviors?
2.  **Hypothesize Alternative Rules:** Based on the analysis of failed examples, formulate alternative or additional rules that could explain the observed transformations.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to incorporate the new rules, making it more comprehensive and accurate.
4. **Prioritize context**: It's important to understand the goal and context of the transformation as well as the individual steps.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here, I will list the results of execution and use the interface to generate additional observation to establish a comprehensive understanding.

```tool_code
print(f'{task.train=}')
for i, example in enumerate(task.train):
    input_grid = example["input"]
    output_grid = example["output"]
    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)
    print(f'{i=}')
    print(f'{input_grid=}')
    print(f'{output_grid=}')
    print(f'{predicted_output=}')
    print(f'{predicted_output == output_grid=}')

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
