objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - type: scalar
    value: 7
    color: orange

actions:
  - type: count_color
    input: grid
    parameters:
      color: red
    output: count_of_red_pixels

  - type: transform
    input: count_of_red_pixels
    logic:  add_to_background_count # add number to background count
    output: scalar

relationships:
  - input_grid_elements_to_output_scalar: "The output scalar seems to be related to something about the non-zero pixels in the input grid, probably a count related to their quantity and a value representing background"
