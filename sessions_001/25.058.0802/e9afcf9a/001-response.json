Both grids are composed of single-digit integers, representing colors. The input grid consists of two horizontal lines of equal length. The first line is entirely composed of the digit '3' (green), and the second line is entirely composed of the digit '9' (maroon). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but the values alternate between '3' and '9' in a checkerboard pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
