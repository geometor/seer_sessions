observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects: [mixed colors]
      output_objects: [horizontal, blue_line]
      relationship: "blue pixel count determines output length"
      result: "success"
  - example_2:
      input_objects: [green, yellow, blue]
      output_objects: [single, green_pixel]
      relationship: "output is 1x1 green, input has green"
      result: "fail"
  - example_3:
      input_objects: [many colors, no blue]
      output_objects: [empty]
      relationship: "no blue in input, output is empty"
      result: "success"
  - example_4:
    input_objects: [green, yellow]
    output_objects: [empty]
    relationship: "output is empty"
    result: "success"
  - example_5:
    input_objects: [green, black]
    output_objects: [single, green_pixel]
    relationship: "output is 1x1 green, input has green"
    result: "fail"

colors:
    - appears the output is 1x1 if the color green is present
    - if there is no green, and no blue, the output is empty
    - if blue is present, output is 1 x N, N = count of blue
