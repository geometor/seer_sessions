Previous Code:
```python
"""
Examine the input grid. Locate the single cell that has a non-zero value. Create a 1x1 output grid. Place the value of the non-zero cell into the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_non_zero_cell(grid):
    # Iterate through the grid to find the non-zero cell
    for row_idx, row in enumerate(grid):
        for col_idx, cell_value in enumerate(row):
            if cell_value != 0:
                return row_idx, col_idx, cell_value
    return None  # Return None if no non-zero cell is found

def transform(input_grid):
    # Find the non-zero cell and its value
    result = find_non_zero_cell(input_grid)
    
    if result is None:  # Handle cases where no non-zero cell exists. Could return an empty grid or raise an exception.
        return np.array([])

    row_idx, col_idx, cell_value = result

    output_grid = np.array([[cell_value]])

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
