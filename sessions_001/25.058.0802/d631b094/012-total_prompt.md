Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all red (value '2') pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of contiguous red pixels in the horizontal direction.
3. **Construct** output with all red pixels, arranged in a single row, preserving the horizontal contiguity.
4.  **Discard** all non-red pixels (in this case, only black pixels were present).
"""

import numpy as np

def _count_contiguous_red_pixels(row):
    """Counts contiguous red (value 2) pixels in a row."""
    count = 0
    current_run = 0
    for pixel in row:
        if pixel == 2:
            current_run += 1
        else:
            count = max(count, current_run)
            current_run = 0
    count = max(count, current_run)  # Handle runs at the end of the row
    return count

        for c_idx, pixel in enumerate(row):
            if pixel == 2:
                red_pixels.append((r_idx, c_idx))

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focused on identifying and extracting contiguous horizontal sequences of red pixels. This worked for the first example but failed on subsequent examples. The failures indicate that the transformation rule is more complex and involves factors beyond simple horizontal contiguity. The varying sizes and the presence of other colors in some outputs (which were not present in the initial example) suggest we need to consider:

1.  **Object Identification Beyond Color:** The code currently only focuses on red pixels. We need a more general concept of "objects" as contiguous regions of the same color.
2.  **Relative Positioning:** The output isn't just about *what* objects exist, but also potentially their relative positions or sizes.
3.  **Color Inclusion:** The output can contain colors *other* than red. The existing code only handles a single color (red)

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Broaden Object Identification:** Modify the code to identify *all* contiguous regions of pixels with the same color, not just red.  We'll need a function to find connected components.
2.  **Analyze Object Properties:**  For each identified object, record properties like color, size (number of pixels), bounding box (min/max row and column), and potentially shape.
3.  **Relate Input to Output:** Instead of hardcoding a rule, try to find a relationship between the *properties* of the input objects and the output grid. This could involve sorting objects by size, selecting specific colors, or replicating patterns.
4. **Handle Background.** Account for what happens when an output contains no object.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

I'll use `print` statements inside a `code_execution` block to inspect the input and output grids and gather specific information. This will help confirm my understanding and build a better YAML representation.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    print("Input Grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Output Grid:")
    print(output_grid)
    print("Input shape:", input_grid.shape)
    print("Output shape:", output_grid.shape)
    print("Input unique values:", np.unique(input_grid))
    print("Output unique values:", np.unique(output_grid))
    print("-" * 20)

task_data = [
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[2, 2, 2]]
    },
   {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[2, 2]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[2]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[2, 2, 2, 2]]
    },
    {
        "input":  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]],
        "output": [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]
    }

]

for example in task_data:
    analyze_example(np.array(example["input"]), np.array(example["output"]))
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
