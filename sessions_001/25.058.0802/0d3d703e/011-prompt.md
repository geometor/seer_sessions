Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a color mapping applied to each pixel of a 2D grid.  The input grid's dimensions are preserved in the output grid. The following color substitutions are performed:

1. Red (2) is replaced with Magenta (6).
2. Green (3) is replaced with Yellow (4).
3. Azure (8) is replaced with Maroon (9).
Any other colors present in the input would remain unchanged. The size of the grid may vary.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Define the color mapping.
    color_map = {
        2: 6,  # Red to Magenta
        3: 4,  # Green to Yellow
        8: 9   # Azure to Maroon
    }

    # Iterate through each pixel in the grid.
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            # Get the color of the current pixel.
            current_color = input_grid[i, j]

            # Apply color mapping if the current color is in the map.
            if current_color in color_map:
                output_grid[i, j] = color_map[current_color]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
