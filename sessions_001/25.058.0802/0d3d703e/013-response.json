Each pixel has a single numerical value (0-9) representing a specific color. The transformation appears to maintain the grid's dimensions (3x3) but changes the color (numerical value) of each pixel according to a consistent rule. The input grid consists of three distinct colors (represented by 5, 8, and 6), and the output grid also consists of three distinct colors (represented by 1, 9, and 2), suggesting a one-to-one mapping between input and output colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Each color in the input is consistently replaced with a corresponding color in the output, while the grid structure itself remains unchanged.\n"
