The transformation rule is as follows: Each cell in the input grid is incremented by one. If the incremented value is equal to 10, the value is changed to 0. The output grid has the same dimensions and spatial arrangement as the input grid. The transformation is purely element-wise and does not involve any spatial reasoning or object interaction beyond corresponding cell locations.
