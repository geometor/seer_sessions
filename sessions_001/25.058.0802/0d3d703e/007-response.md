Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel in the input grid has a corresponding pixel in the output grid at the same position. The transformation seems to be a simple color mapping, meaning each input color is consistently replaced by a specific output color. The spatial arrangement (3x3 grid) remains constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: mapped
    relationships:
      - spatial: "input pixel (x, y) corresponds to output pixel (x, y)"
    transformations:
      - type: color_mapping
        mapping:
          red (2): magenta (6)
          green (3): yellow (4)
          azure (8): maroon (9)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of pixels, where each pixel has one of the following colors: red (2), green (3), or azure (8).
2.  **Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid, replace its color according to the following mapping:
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6)
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4)
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9)
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the new colors, preserving the original spatial arrangement. The size of the output is identical with the input.

Essentially this a direct color substitution.
