## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF740D6CB0>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF740D65D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer in the input grid corresponds to a specific color, and the output grid maintains the same dimensions but with different integer values, also representing colors. The transformation appears to be a simple, consistent numerical mapping applied to each cell independently. There are no apparent spatial or object-based interactions; the transformation is purely based on the initial value of each cell.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_property: color
  - transformation: mapping
    domain: integers (input)
    range: integers (output)
    rule: "add 1 to each input value"
    scope: "each cell independently"
  - input_colors:
    3: green
    1: blue
    2: red
  - output_colors:
      4: yellow
      5: gray
      6: magenta
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to increment each integer value in the input grid by 1. This new value becomes the corresponding cell's value in the output grid. The spatial arrangement and relative positions of the cells remain unchanged. The core operation is a uniform scalar addition applied element-wise.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
