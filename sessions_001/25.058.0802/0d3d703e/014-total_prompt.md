## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 8 6
5 8 6
5 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73D1FE30>

**output:**
```
1 9 2
1 9 2
1 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73D1FED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a single numerical value (0-9) representing a specific color. The transformation appears to maintain the grid's dimensions (3x3) but changes the color (numerical value) of each pixel according to a consistent rule. The input grid consists of three distinct colors (represented by 5, 8, and 6), and the output grid also consists of three distinct colors (represented by 1, 9, and 2), suggesting a one-to-one mapping between input and output colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_values: [5, 8, 6]
    output_values: [1, 9, 2]
    properties:
      - property: color_mapping
        mapping:
          5: 1
          8: 9
          6: 2
      - property: shape_preservation
        description: The grid dimensions remain constant.
  - type: transformation
    description: "Color substitution based on a fixed mapping."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Color Mapping:** For each pixel in the input grid, replace its value according to the following mapping:
    *   If the pixel value is 5, change it to 1.
    *   If the pixel value is 8, change it to 9.
    *   If the pixel value is 6, change it to 2.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.

In essence, the transformation is a simple color substitution cipher applied to the grid. Each color in the input is consistently replaced with a corresponding color in the output, while the grid structure itself remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
