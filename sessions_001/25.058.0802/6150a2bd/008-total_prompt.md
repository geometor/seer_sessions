## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF740D6CB0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73EB5950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation seems to involve a 90-degree clockwise rotation and possibly some color changes, but more examples would be useful to establish the exact relationship. The layout of numbers appears mirrored.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: pixels
    element_type: integer
    element_range: [0, 9]
    mapping: |
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow
      5: gray
      6: magenta
      7: orange
      8: azure
      9: maroon

  - observation: input_grid
    values: |
      [[5, 5, 2],
       [1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0]]

  - observation: output_grid
    values: |
      [[0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 1],
       [2, 5, 5]]
  - action: rotation
    type: clockwise
    degrees: 90

  - possible_relation: color_preservation
    note: "Some colors appear consistent between input and output, needs verification."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Maintain the number value and positioning, and change only the color based on the color mapping**

This initial program captures the most obvious transformation: the rotation. Further examples are needed to refine how colors are handled since more complex color changes could happen, or simple static rules could be developed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
