Each pixel has a numerical value corresponding to a specific color. The output grid appears to be a uniform 3x3 grid with all pixels having the same color and numerical value (6, magenta). The key seems to lie in identifying what determines the color of the output grid based on the input. My initial hypothesis is that the most frequent, or the average color value maybe picked. I will search for relationships to find the right logic, such as looking for a specific color, a predominant color, a specific position, or some mathematical relationship between colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
