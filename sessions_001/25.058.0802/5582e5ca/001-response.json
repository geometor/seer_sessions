The input grid has varying colors, while the output grid appears to be filled with a single color. The dimensions of the input and output grids seem to be the same (3x3). The key seems to lie in identifying a specific color within the input and using it to fill the entire output grid. In this particular example, the color yellow (4) appears multiple times and is likely the determining factor.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
