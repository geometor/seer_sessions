## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF74101DB0>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF74323930>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid appears to be filled entirely with a single color (maroon, represented by the number 9). The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (3x3).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid is a 3x3 matrix of pixels."
  - observation: "Each pixel has a color, represented by a number between 0 and 9."
  - observation: "Output grid is also a 3x3 matrix of pixels."
  - observation: "All pixels in the output grid have the same color: maroon (9)."
  - relationship: "The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical."
  - action: "All colored pixels in the input are set to the value 9."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to replace every pixel in the input grid with the color maroon (value 9). In other words, create a grid of the same dimension and size as the input, and the color for every element to be 9.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
