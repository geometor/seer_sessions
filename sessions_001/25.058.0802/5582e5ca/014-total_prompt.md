## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF74323930>

**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73CE6170>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a numerical value corresponding to a specific color. The output grid appears to be a uniform 3x3 grid with all pixels having the same color and numerical value (6, magenta). The key seems to lie in identifying what determines the color of the output grid based on the input. My initial hypothesis is that the most frequent, or the average color value maybe picked. I will search for relationships to find the right logic, such as looking for a specific color, a predominant color, a specific position, or some mathematical relationship between colors.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input:
  grid_size: 3x3
  data_type: integer (0-9) representing colors
  colors: [yellow, magenta, maroon, blue, azure]
output:
  grid_size: 3x3
  data_type: integer
  color: magenta (6)
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: pixels arranged in a 3x3 grid
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: input grid is transformed into a uniform output grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target color:** Scan the input grid and find the value that occurs in either 2 diagonal positions or 2 horizontally or vertically adjacent positions.
    In the provided example input, observe that cells with numerical value `6` are located in positions (0,1), (1,0) and (2,2).
2. **Create output**: All pixels become the target color.
    Create a 3x3 grid where all pixels have the identified target color value (6 in the example).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
