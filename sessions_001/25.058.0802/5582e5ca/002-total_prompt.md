## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF740D6CB0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF74101DB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid has varying colors, while the output grid appears to be filled with a single color. The dimensions of the input and output grids seem to be the same (3x3). The key seems to lie in identifying a specific color within the input and using it to fill the entire output grid. In this particular example, the color yellow (4) appears multiple times and is likely the determining factor.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: colored pixels (0-9)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: colored pixels (0-9)
  - type: object
    description: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: action
    description: transformation
    input: input grid
    output: output grid
    rule: "Identify a specific color in the input and fill the output grid with that color"
  - type: observation
    description: "the output color might correspond to yellow (4)"
  - type: relationship
      subject: output grid
      predicate: filled with
      object: "a color from the input grid, likely yellow (4)"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Color:** Examine the input grid and identify the color yellow (represented by the digit 4).
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Fill Output Grid:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the target color identified in step 1 (yellow/4).

In simpler term: The transformation involves finding all of instances of the color 'yellow' and then to reproduce input as an output grid with every value is equal to 'yellow'.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
