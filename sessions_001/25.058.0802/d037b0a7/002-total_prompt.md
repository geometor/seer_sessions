## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73CE6170>

**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BF73EB5DB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color. The transformation seems to involve some kind of propagation or filling of color values based on existing colors. The magenta (6) color appears to be significant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
            value: varies
  - type: color_group
    properties:
        - dominant_color: 6

actions:
  - type: fill
    description: Replacing 0 values based on non zero color values.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Cells are adjacent horizontally and vertically.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Key Colors:** Find all cells that are not white (0).
2.  **Propagation of the Dominant color, magenta (6):** Iterate to fill all cells that are white to magenta if the cell to its right is magenta.
3.   **Fill with the Center Color:** All the remaining white cells (0) will be the same color of the center cell, yellow (4).

In simple terms, the magenta (6) color in the top right corner expands to the left. Any remaining white cells are changed to the color of the center, yellow (4).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
