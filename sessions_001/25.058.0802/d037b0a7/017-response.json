            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too specific, focusing on copying the second row to multiple rows. While this worked for the first training example, it failed for the subsequent ones. The core issue is that the initial program overgeneralized from a single example. The provided examples show a different, much simpler, pattern. The transformation is replicating the entire input grid and changing the color of all non-white pixels to a single different color.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs in the training set to identify the *consistent* transformation rule, not just a rule that works for one case.\n2.  **Simplify the Logic:** The current code is overly complex. Based on the additional examples, the transformation is likely a simple color replacement within a duplicated grid, and does not involve row manipulation.\n3.  **Focus on color change, not row copying:** The current description emphasizes rows, which is misleading. We need to shift the focus to color.\n4. **Object Identification is critical:** We need to start to track the object of focus.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, including the predicted output (which is based on current source code, above), the correct output from the training data, a comparison of dimensions, a description of the transformation.\n\n| Example | Input Dims | Output Dims | Predicted Output Dims | Correct Dims | Transformation Description                                                                | Correct? |\n| :------ | :--------- | :---------- | :-------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |\n| 1       | 3x3        | 3x3         | 3x3                   | True         | Input: mixed colors. Output: all non-white pixels become blue.                       | False    |\n| 2       | 3x3        | 3x3         | 3x3                   | True        | Input: mixed colors. Output: all non-white pixels become green.                             | False      |\n| 3       | 6x6        | 6x6        | 6x6                     | True         | Input: mixed colors. Output: all non-white pixels become yellow.       | False     |\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      Each input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions.\n  - object_identification: |\n      The primary objects are the entire grids and the individual pixels within them.\n      Pixels are characterized by their color.\n  - transformation_rule: |\n     The output grid is a copy of the input grid.  All the non-white colors in the input grid are\n     replaced by a single color in the output grid.\n  - color_consistency: |\n      The replacement color is consistent within each output grid, but varies between different examples.\n      The replacement colors across examples are blue, green, and yellow.\n  - background_color:\n      White pixels (color 0) remain unchanged in all examples.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Copy:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n2.  **Identify:** Determine the unique *replacement* color for this specific input/output pair from the example. It will be used to replace *all* non-white colors.\n3. **Iterate:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.\n4.  **Replace Colors (Conditional):** If a pixel in the *input grid* is *not* white (0), replace the corresponding pixel's color in the *output grid* with the single *replacement* color identified in step 2.\n5.  **Preserve White:** If a pixel in the input grid *is* white (0), keep the color of corresponding pixel's color in the output grid the same (which starts as a copy, so will also be white).\n6. **Return:** The output grid, is now a copy of the original, with all non-white pixels set to the replacement color.\n\n"
