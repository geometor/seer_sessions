There are three such objects in this example.\n\n2.  **Object 1 Transformation:**\n    *   Locate the bottommost cell of the first azure object (horizontal line).\n    *   Place a blue (1) cell directly adjacent to the left of the bottom of this azure object.\n\n3.  **Object 2 Transformation:**\n    *    Locate the topmost cell of the second azure object (vertical line).\n    *   Place a blue (1) cell directly adjacent to the right of the top of this azure object.\n\n4.  **Object 3 Transformation:**\n     * Consider the third object.\n     * The object forms a 90-degree angle going up and then right. Place the blue cell adjacent to its top point\n\n5. **Retain:** Maintain the initial positions and the shape of the azure objects.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves identifying azure objects and placing blue cells adjacent to specific points on these objects, similar to the first example, but generalized for three azure objects and to the type of the shape: horizontal, vertical and corner.\n"
