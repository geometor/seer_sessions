There are two such objects.\n\n2.  **Object 1 Transformation:**\n    *   Locate the topmost cell of the first azure object.\n    *   Place a blue (1) cell directly adjacent to the right of the top of this azure object.\n\n3.  **Object 2 Transformation:**\n    *    Locate the bottommost cell of the second azure object.\n    *   Place a blue (1) cell directly adjacent to the left of the bottom of this azure object.\n\n4. Retain: Maintain the initial positions and the shape of the azure objects.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves identifying azure objects and placing blue cells adjacent to specific points on these objects. The first azure object gets a blue cell to the right of the top end, and second azure object receives a blue cell to the left of its bottom end.\n"
