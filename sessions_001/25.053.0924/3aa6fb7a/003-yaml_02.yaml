objects:
  - name: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - rows: int (number of rows)
      - cols: int (number of columns)
      - cells: list of lists (pixel values)

  - name: pixel
    description: An individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - value: int (0-9, representing color)
      - row: int (row index)
      - col: int (column index)
      - adjacent_pixels: list of pixels (neighbors in all four directions)

actions:
  - name: identify_azure_pixels
    description: Find all pixels with a value of 8.
    input: grid
    output: list of pixel coordinates

  - name: check_adjacency
    description: For a given azure pixel, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
    input: pixel, grid
    output: list of adjacent pixel coordinates

  - name: transform_white_to_blue
    description: Change the value of a white pixel (0) to blue (1).
    input: pixel
    output: modified pixel

transformation_rule: |
  For each azure pixel in the input grid, check its immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right).
  If a neighbor is white (0), change it to blue (1). Do not change vertically or diagonally adjacent cells.
