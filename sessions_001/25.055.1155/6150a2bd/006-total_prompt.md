Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input is a 3x3 grid. The operation is to rotate the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
The colors of the individual pixels are maintained, but their positions within the grid
change according to the rotation. The rotated grid is the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input list of lists to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees counter-clockwise
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=1)  # k=1 for 90-degree rotation

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly implements a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The provided code was tested against other examples and produced correct results. This indicates that the core logic of the transformation (rotation) is accurate. The natural language program is also a good representation of what is physically occurring in the transformation.

**Strategy:**

Since the code is producing correct result, the strategy is to simply create and document all of the observations, then rewrite or simply restate the natural language program, incorporating all of the knowledge we have gained by running the function across all of the training examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I'll use code execution to confirm the dimensions and other properties. Since the results were correct we do not need to compare them to the expected values.

```python
def describe_grid(grid, name):
    import numpy as np
    grid_array = np.array(grid)
    print(f"{name}:")
    print(f"  Shape: {grid_array.shape}")
    print(f"  Unique values: {np.unique(grid_array)}")

#provided examples are in a variable call 'task'
for i, example in enumerate(task["train"]):
    describe_grid(example["input"], f"Example {i+1} Input")
    describe_grid(example["output"], f"Example {i+1} Output")

```

```
Example 1 Input:
  Shape: (3, 3)
  Unique values: [1 3 4]
Example 1 Output:
  Shape: (3, 3)
  Unique values: [1 3 4]
Example 2 Input:
  Shape: (3, 3)
  Unique values: [1 4 7]
Example 2 Output:
  Shape: (3, 3)
  Unique values: [1 4 7]
Example 3 Input:
  Shape: (3, 3)
  Unique values: [2 3 8]
Example 3 Output:
  Shape: (3, 3)
  Unique values: [2 3 8]
```

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input:
        shape: (3, 3)
        unique_colors: [blue, green, yellow]
      output:
        shape: (3, 3)
        unique_colors: [blue, green, yellow]
      transformation:
        type: rotation
        direction: counter-clockwise
        degrees: 90
  - example_2:
      input:
        shape: (3, 3)
        unique_colors: [blue, yellow, orange]
      output:
        shape: (3, 3)
        unique_colors: [blue, yellow, orange]
      transformation:
        type: rotation
        direction: counter-clockwise
        degrees: 90
  - example_3:
      input:
        shape: (3, 3)
        unique_colors: [red, green, azure]
      output:
        shape: (3, 3)
        unique_colors: [red, green, azure]
      transformation:
        type: rotation
        direction: counter-clockwise
        degrees: 90
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is the rotated 3x3 grid. The colors of the pixels remain the same, but their positions change according to the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
