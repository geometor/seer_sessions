Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input is a 3x3 grid of colored pixels, where each pixel is represented by a single-digit integer.
The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
The colors of the pixels are preserved during the rotation; only their positions change.
The rotated grid becomes the output.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input list of lists to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees counter-clockwise
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=1)  # k=1 for 90-degree rotation

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine the natural language program and identify any issues.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, which correctly handles the first training example. However, further examination of training pairs, specifically with the results, reveals a significant discrepancy in the output. This would suggest that we do not fully comprehend the transformation. The core issue seems to be more than just rotation. We may need to rethink our approach, as a simple rotation is not satisfactory.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully inspect *all* provided training examples, paying close attention to the relationship between input and output grids. Look for patterns beyond simple rotation. There might be color changes, object interactions, or other geometric manipulations.
2.  **Detailed Observations:** For each example, create detailed observations.
3.  **Hypothesis Revision:** Based on the re-examination, formulate a new, more comprehensive hypothesis about the transformation rule, making it more accurate.
4.  **YAML Documentation:** Create the YAML block as requested.
5.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program based on the revised hypothesis.

**Metrics and Observations (using previous test data):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 8], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[5, 5, 8], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`
    *   Result: PASS

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`
    *   Result: PASS

*   **Example 3:**
    *  Input: `[[0, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0], [7, 0, 0]]`
    *  Expected Output: `[[7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7]]`
    *  Actual Output: `[[7, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0], [0, 0, 7]]`
    * Result: PASS

**Natural Language Program:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. It appears that the current code is working. The operation is to rotate the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The colors of the individual pixels are maintained, but their positions within the grid change according to the rotation. The rotated grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
