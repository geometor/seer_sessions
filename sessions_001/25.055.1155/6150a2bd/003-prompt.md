Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input is a 3x3 grid of colored pixels, where each pixel is represented by a single-digit integer.
The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
The colors of the pixels are preserved during the rotation; only their positions change.
The rotated grid becomes the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input list of lists to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees counter-clockwise
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=1)  # k=1 for 90-degree rotation

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
