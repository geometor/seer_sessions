## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71A857E6C520>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71A857E6DA50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors in the input grid are changing to different colors in the output grid. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), blue (1), and azure (8). The output introduces a new color, gray (5). The transformation seems to focus on specific colors and replacing them.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is 3x3, containing pixels of colors red (2), blue (1), and azure (8).
  - observation: |
      The output grid is 3x3, containing pixels of colors red (2) and gray (5).
  - action: |
      Pixels of color blue (1) and azure (8) are replaced by gray (5).
  - relationship: |
      The spatial arrangement of the red (2) pixels remains unchanged. Only the blue (1) and azure (8) pixels transform to the color gray(5).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are either blue (1) or azure (8).
2.  **Transform:** Change the color of all identified pixels (blue and azure) to gray (5).
3.  **Preserve:** Leave all other pixels (red (2)) unchanged.
4.  **Output:** Present the modified grid as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
