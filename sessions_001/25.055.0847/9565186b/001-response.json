The colors in the input grid are changing to different colors in the output grid. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), blue (1), and azure (8). The output introduces a new color, gray (5). The transformation seems to focus on specific colors and replacing them.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
