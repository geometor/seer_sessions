# expected_output_grid = [[1, 1, 6], [1, 1, 6], [1, 1, 6]]
# actual_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
# print(f"Matches Expected: {expected_output_grid == actual_output_grid}")
# Observations: Matches Expected: True (already known, this was the base case)

# Hypothetical Code Execution Analysis - Example Pair 2:

# Observations: Matches Expected: False.
#   Input:  A vertical line of gray between 2 vertical lines of white
#   Expected output: A horizontal line of gray between 2 horizontal lines of white
#	Actual output (from 90 degree rotation):
