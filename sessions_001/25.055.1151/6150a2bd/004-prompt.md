# Hypothetical Code Execution Analysis - Example Pair 1:
# input_grid = [[6, 1, 1], [6, 1, 1], [6, 1, 1]]
# expected_output_grid = [[1, 1, 6], [1, 1, 6], [1, 1, 6]]
# actual_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
# print(f"Matches Expected: {expected_output_grid == actual_output_grid}")
# Observations: Matches Expected: True (already known, this was the base case)

# Hypothetical Code Execution Analysis - Example Pair 2:
# input_grid =  [[5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5]]
# expected_output_grid = [[5, 5, 5], [0, 5, 0], [5, 5, 5]]
# actual_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
# print(f"Matches Expected: {expected_output_grid == actual_output_grid}")
# Observations: Matches Expected: False.
#   Input:  A vertical line of gray between 2 vertical lines of white
#   Expected output: A horizontal line of gray between 2 horizontal lines of white
#	Actual output (from 90 degree rotation):
#		[[5, 5, 5],
#       [0, 5, 0],
#       [5, 5, 5]]


# Hypothetical Code Execution Analysis - Example Pair 3:
# input_grid = [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]

# actual_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
# print(f"Matches Expected: {expected_output_grid == actual_output_grid}")
# Observations: Matches Expected: False
#   Input: horizontal 8x3 grid of maroon
#	Expected Output: vertical 3x8 grid of maroon
#	Actual Output: (from 90 degree rotation)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
