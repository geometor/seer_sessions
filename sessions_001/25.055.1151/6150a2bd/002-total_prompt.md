## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x72AB78A68460>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x72AB78A69990>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation from input to output seems to involve a rotation of the grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    representation: integers (0-9)
    color_map:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow
      5: gray
      6: magenta
      7: orange
      8: azure
      9: maroon
  - observation: input grid is transformed into output grid
  - transformation_type: rotation
  - rotation_direction: counter-clockwise
  - rotation_angle: 90 degrees
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. This means that each pixel in the input grid is moved to a new position in the output grid, corresponding to a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.

Specifically:

1.  The top-left pixel of the input becomes the bottom-left pixel of the output.
2.  The top-center pixel of the input becomes the left-center pixel of the output.
3. The top-right pixel of the input becomes the top-left pixel of the output.
4. The center-left pixel of the input becomes the bottom-center pixel of the output.
5. The center pixel stays in the center position.
6. The center-right pixel of the input becomes the top-center pixel of the output.
7. The bottom-left pixel of the input becomes the bottom-right pixel of the output.
8. The bottom-center pixel of the input becomes the right-center pixel of the output.
9. The bottom-right pixel of the input becomes the top-right pixel of the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
