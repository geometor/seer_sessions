facts:
  - observation: The input is a 2x2 grid.
  - observation: The output is a 4x4 grid.
  - observation: Each cell in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - observation: The colors in the input grid are replicated in the corresponding 2x2 blocks in the output grid.
  - observation: The output grid has a white (0) border around the replicated input cells.
