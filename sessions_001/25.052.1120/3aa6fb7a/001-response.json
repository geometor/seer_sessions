This is the cell that *would* complete a 2x2 square with the three cells forming the L.\n\n3.  **Insert Color:** A new cell with color 1 (blue) is placed at each located inner corner. The existing azure objects remain.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe following steps constitute the natural language program to do the transformation.\n\n1. Find all L-shaped objects of color 8.\n2. For each such object, locate the inner corner cell where the color 1 will go.\n3. Change the color of the cell to 1.\n\n"
