Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the L
        count: 2
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (1,1)
        count: 2
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: varies  # Inserted inside the L-shapes.
        count: 2
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the transformation, focusing on objects, predicates, and actions:

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two "L-shaped" objects made of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Locate Insertion Point:** For each L-shaped object, we locate the "inner corner" of the L. This is the cell that *would* complete a 2x2 square with the three cells forming the L.

3.  **Insert Color:** A new cell with color 1 (blue) is placed at each located inner corner. The existing azure objects remain.

**Natural Language Program**

The following steps constitute the natural language program to do the transformation.

1. Find all L-shaped objects of color 8.
2. For each such object, locate the inner corner cell where the color 1 will go.
3. Change the color of the cell to 1.
