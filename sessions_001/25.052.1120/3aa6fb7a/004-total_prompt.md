Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and refine the natural language program describing the transformation.

**Initial Natural Language Program (from the previous code):**

1.  Identify L-shaped objects (color 8) in the input grid.
2.  For each L-shaped object, find the "inner corner" cell.
3.  Insert a cell of color 1 (blue) at each inner corner.

**Analysis of the Results and Refinement:**

The initial program works correctly for Example 1, but fails on Example 2. The issue is not in identifying the L-shapes or their inner corners; the `find_l_shapes` and `get_inner_corner` functions seem to work correctly based on the provided test output. The failure in Example 2 arises in line 69 of the provided code.

I traced what must be happening:
1. output_grid is initilized as a copy of input_grid
2. The coordinates of inner_corner is determined from output_grid
3. At line 69, output_grid is changed in place using: output_grid[inner_corner] = 1

The error is due to line 69.

Looking back at example two, in the last azure L shape, the final blue
pixel is placed incorrectly in (5,3) when it should be in (5,4). The reason is
that the position of the correct corner depends on the location of the *tip*
of the L-shape.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify L-shaped objects:** Find all L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid. An L-shape is defined as three connected cells of color 8 where two cells are adjacent in a row or column, and the third cell is adjacent to one of those two, forming a 2x2 square with one cell missing.

2.  **Locate the Inner Corner:** For each identified L-shape, determine the "inner corner." The inner corner is the cell *adjacent* to the 'tip' of the L and that would complete a 2x2 square. This cell is always adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to two cells of the L-shape. It never touches the tip diagonally.

3. **Insert Blue Cell**: Change color of inner corner to 1(blue).

This revised natural language program more accurately captures the core logic of the transformation. It explicitly defines what an "L-shape" and its "inner corner" are in this context, focusing on the adjacency and the formation of a potential 2x2 square. This removes the ambiguity, leading to the correct transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
