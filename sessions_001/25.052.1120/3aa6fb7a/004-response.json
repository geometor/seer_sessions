An L-shape is defined as three connected cells of color 8 where two cells are adjacent in a row or column, and the third cell is adjacent to one of those two, forming a 2x2 square with one cell missing.\n\n2.  **Locate the Inner Corner:** For each identified L-shape, determine the \"inner corner.\" The inner corner is the cell *adjacent* to the 'tip' of the L and that would complete a 2x2 square. This cell is always adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to two cells of the L-shape. It never touches the tip diagonally.\n\n3. **Insert Blue Cell**: Change color of inner corner to 1(blue).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_l_shapes(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds L-shaped objects of a specific color in the grid.\n    Returns a list of coordinates (row, col) of the \"tip\" of each L.\n    The tip is defined as the cell which has neighbors to the right and down.\n    \"\"\"\n    l_shapes = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows - 1):\n        for c in range(cols - 1):\n            if grid[r, c] == color:\n                # Check for L-shape (tip at top-left)\n                if grid[r + 1, c] == color and grid[r, c + 1] == color:\n                    l_shapes.append((r, c))\n                # Check for L-shape (tip at top-right)\n                elif grid[r + 1, c] == color and grid[r, c-1] == color and c > 0:\n                    l_shapes.append((r,c))\n                # Check for L-shape (tip at bottom-left)\n                elif grid[r-1,c] == color and grid[r,c+1] == color and r > 0:\n                    l_shapes.append((r,c))\n                 # Check for L-shape (tip at bottom-right)\n                elif grid[r-1,c] == color and grid[r,c-1] == color and r > 0 and c > 0:\n                    l_shapes.append((r,c))    \n    return l_shapes\n\ndef get_inner_corner(grid, tip, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the inner corner coordinate for a given L-shape tip.\n    \"\"\"\n    r, c = tip\n    # Check which type of L-shape it is and calculate the inner corner\n    \n    if grid[r + 1, c] == color and grid[r, c + 1] == color:\n         return (r + 1, c + 1)\n\n    elif grid[r + 1, c] == color and grid[r, c - 1] == color:\n        return (r+1, c-1)\n        \n    elif grid[r - 1, c] == color and grid[r, c + 1] == color:\n        return (r-1, c+1)\n        \n    elif grid[r - 1, c] == color and grid[r, c - 1] == color:\n        return (r-1,c-1)\n\n    return None  # Should not happen if the tip is correctly identified\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the L-shape rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find all L-shapes of color 8\n    l_shapes = find_l_shapes(input_grid, 8) # use input_grid\n\n    # For each L-shape, find the inner corner and change its color to 1\n    for tip in l_shapes:\n        inner_corner = get_inner_corner(input_grid, tip, 8) # use input_grid\n        if inner_corner:\n            output_grid[inner_corner] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
