Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Identify all non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each non-zero pixel:
    *   Create a horizontal line of the same color, extending across the entire row of the pixel's original position.
    *    Create a vertical line of the same color, extending across the entire column of the pixel's original position.
3.  Combine the expanded lines to form the output grid. If a pixel location is altered by more than one expansion, maintain the original non-zero value.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified rule. The rule correctly identifies the expansion of non-zero pixels into horizontal and vertical lines. However, it fails to account for the behavior when these expansions intersect, specifically in cases with original pixels that are non-zero and different values. The initial implementation used a conditional check (`if output_grid[r,i] == 0:`) that prioritized original pixel values. This works as long as there's at most one non-zero value in the input. We need to adjust this to ensure *all* non-zero pixels in the input contribute their color to both their row and column in the output, regardless if lines intersect.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Eliminate Conditional Assignment:** The main flaw is the conditional logic that *only* overwrites a pixel in the `output_grid` *if* the `output_grid` pixel location is 0. We need to replace this behavior with a more universal application of the transformation, that allows any horizontal/vertical expansion from any non-zero input pixel to write it's value to the output grid.

2.  **Re-evaluate Examples:** Carefully examine all provided examples, noting where the initial logic fails. Pay close attention to interactions between expanding lines of different colors.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To get accurate metrics, let's define a function to compare the generated output with the expected output.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """Compares two grids and returns the number of differing pixels."""
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return -1  # Indicate shape mismatch
    diff_count = np.sum(grid1 != grid2)
    return diff_count

# Example Usage and Metrics Gathering (This would be done for EACH example)

# Example 1
input_grid1 = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
expected_output1 = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]])
generated_output1 = transform(input_grid1)
diff1 = compare_grids(expected_output1, generated_output1)
print(f"Example 1 Differences: {diff1}")  # Expected: 0

# Example 2
input_grid2 = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
expected_output2 = np.array([[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0]])
generated_output2 = transform(input_grid2)
diff2 = compare_grids(expected_output2, generated_output2)
print(f"Example 2 Differences: {diff2}")  # Expected: 0

# Example 3
input_grid3 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [9, 0, 0, 0]])
expected_output3 = np.array([[9, 0, 8, 0], [9, 8, 8, 8], [9, 0, 8, 0], [9, 9, 9, 9]])
generated_output3 = transform(input_grid3)
diff3 = compare_grids(expected_output3, generated_output3)
print(f"Example 3 Differences: {diff3}")  # Expected: 0

# Example 4
input_grid4 = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]])
expected_output4 = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 5], [1, 1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 0, 5]])
generated_output4 = transform(input_grid4)
diff4 = compare_grids(expected_output4, generated_output4)
print(f"Example 4 Differences: {diff4}")  # Expected: 0

# Example 5:
input_grid5 = np.array([[0, 0, 7, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
expected_output5 = np.array([[0, 0, 7, 0, 5], [0, 0, 7, 0, 5], [0, 0, 7, 0, 5], [0, 0, 7, 0, 5], [0, 0, 7, 0, 5]])
generated_output5 = transform(input_grid5)
diff5 = compare_grids(expected_output5, generated_output5)
print(f"Example 5 Differences: {diff5}") # Expected 0

```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: non-zero pixel
    properties:
      - color: corresponds to the pixel's value (1-9)
      - location: row and column index in the grid
    actions:
      - expand_horizontally: Creates a line of the same color across the entire row.
      - expand_vertically: Creates a line of the same color down the entire column.
  - object: zero pixel
    properties:
      color: 0 (white/background)
    actions:
      - overwritten:  By a non-zero pixel's expansion.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each non-zero pixel:
    *   Create a horizontal line by setting all pixels in the pixel's row to the pixel's color.
    *   Create a vertical line by setting all pixels in the pixel's column to the pixel's color.
3. The output grid is formed from applying all lines.

The crucial difference is the removal of the conditional.  Every non-zero pixel *always* contributes its color to its row and column.  The previous version's conditional logic was an incorrect optimization.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
