The input grids contain a few isolated, non-zero pixels (representing colors other than white/0) within a field of zeros. The output grids show these non-zero pixels expanding to fill rectangular regions, effectively \"flooding\" parts of the grid. The original non-zero pixels act as \"seeds\" for these flooded regions. The flooding seems to stop at the grid boundaries and maintains the original colors. It appears that there are always exactly two non zero colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
