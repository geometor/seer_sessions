All other cells are 0 (white).\n*   The output grid expands the 6 and 7 values, creating a frame/border effect. The expansion creates a cross shape with color 6 and a cross shape, and the original positions are maintained. The areas are bordered by original colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
