Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Salient Feature:** Locate the 2x2 square of green (3) pixels near the center of the input grid.
2.  **Extract the Feature:** Isolate the 2x2 green square.
3.  **Construct the Output:** Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions seem unrelated to the original grid in an obvious manner. Place the 2x2 green square near the center of the output grid.
4.  Fill remaining areas in the output grid with '0' (white). There is no obvious correlation with the remaining colors.
It is likely that the size of the output grid is consistent and the placement of the extracted object is also consistent across examples.
5. Return the result.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
