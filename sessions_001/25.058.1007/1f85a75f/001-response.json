The output grids are significantly smaller, and it appears they are highlighting specific colored regions or objects from the input. It also appears that background may be dropped. Colors and shapes appear important\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Create a new, smaller grid that perfectly contains *only* the selected object, removing any surrounding background (color 0) pixels.\n\n4.  **Output:** Present this cropped, single-object grid as the output.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe transformation rule appears to involve the extraction of a single colored shape from a large grid, with the background removed.\n\nI would describe the context of the problem as filtering, cropping and/or\nfocusing in on a particular element from an image.\n"
