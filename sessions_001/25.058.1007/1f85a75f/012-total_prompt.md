```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focuses solely on finding the largest contiguous block of yellow (color 4) pixels and replicating that block as the output. This approach works for the first training example but fails on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't universally about just extracting the largest yellow block. The other examples suggest a more complex rule is at play, possibly involving identifying specific shapes or patterns, potentially irrespective of the largest yellow area.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to not just the yellow blocks, but also other colors and their spatial relationships. We need to move beyond simple "largest block" extraction.
2.  **Identify Alternative Patterns:** Look for alternative patterns or rules that might explain the transformations. Consider shapes, relative positions, and color combinations.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the pattern analysis, update the natural language program to reflect a more accurate and generalizable transformation rule.
4. **Prepare Information for Future Code Updates**: Structure observations to guide the next iteration.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand the transformations, I will use a combination of visual inspection and targeted code execution to gather specific metrics.

Here's a breakdown of each example and the initial results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 15x15
    *   Output Shape: 4x2
    *   Result: `Correct`
    *Observations:* Largest yellow rectangle extracted

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 19x19
    *   Output Shape: 7x3
    *   Result: `Incorrect`
    *Observations:* Largest yellow block is 3x3, not 7x3. The output matches the size of the black cross.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 13x13
    *   Output Shape: 5x3
    *   Result: `Incorrect`
     *Observations:* Largest yellow block is 2x2, not 5x3. The output seems to pick a different yellow part of the input.

**Code Execution for Metrics**

I'll use `code_execution` to get the shapes of input and output, and the calculated largest yellow block size, for more precision:

```python
import numpy as np

def get_grid_shapes_and_yellow_block(task):
    results = []
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        block_coords = find_largest_yellow_block(input_grid)

        if block_coords is not None:
          row_start, col_start, row_end, col_end = block_coords
          block_size = (row_end - row_start + 1, col_end - col_start + 1)
        else:
          block_size = (0,0)

        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': output_grid.shape,
            'largest_yellow_block_size': block_size,

        })
    return results

**Natural Language Program**

Based on the analysis, the initial program is incorrect. Here's a revised natural language program:

1.  **Examine the input grid.**
2.  **Identify significant shapes**:
      For each color look for complete or partial shapes like rectangles
      or crosses
3.  **Determine the output shape and colors:**
      If there is a complete shape of one color, copy this shape into the
      output.
4. **Handle partial shapes:**
    If there is only a partial shape (e.g., two sides of a rectangle), extend it
    to create a complete shape in the output. The dimensions of the extended
    shape seem arbitrary at first but there will be a discernible rule.
5.  **Default:** If no significant shapes or partial shape, return an empty array
6. The extension will follow a discernible and simple rule.
7. The output will only contain the copied or extended shape, and will
   not contain the rest of the input.

This revised program acknowledges the possibility of different shapes and actions, moving beyond simple extraction of the largest yellow block. It introduces the concept of "significant shapes" and handles both complete and partial shapes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
