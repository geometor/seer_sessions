Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate:** Find the 2x2 green square within the input grid. Record its top-left corner coordinates (row, col).
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The output grid always has 3 columns.
    *   The output grid's number of rows is determined by the green square's row coordinate in the input grid.  Specifically, the number of output rows is equal to the input green square's row index + 1.
3.  **Construct:** Create an output grid with the determined dimensions, initially filled with black (or white, doesn't matter for this rule since it is overwritten).
4. **Populate the green pixels:**
    * Place the 2x2 green square from input to the output, with the top-left at (0,0)
    * Add a green pixel to each output row at column 2.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observing a single training example. While the generated code correctly transforms the first example, it fails on subsequent examples. This indicates that the initial hypothesis was too specific and didn't capture the general rule governing the transformation. The primary issue is that the rule for output grid dimensions (specifically the number of rows) and the placement of green pixels is overly dependent on the initial green square's position in the first input example.  We need to generalize the rule to consider properties of the input that are consistent across all examples.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all input-output pairs in the training set to identify common patterns and relationships that hold true across *all* examples, not just the first.
2.  **Identify Invariant Features:** Determine which aspects of the input grid reliably predict the output grid's structure and content.  The size and relative positions of green and other colored regions might matter and the current implementation only focuses on the upper-left position of the green square,
3.  **Generalize the Rule:**  Formulate a new natural language program that describes the transformation in a way that is consistent with *all* training examples. This will likely involve a more general rule for determining the output grid's dimensions and pixel placement.
4.  **Refactor Code:** Update the Python code to implement the revised, generalized rule.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code against all training examples. If errors persist, repeat steps 1-4, further analyzing the examples and refining the rule and code.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output = None):
    """
    Executes the transformation function on the input and compares it to the expected output.
    """
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)
    output_np = np.array(output_grid)

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input Grid Height**: Determine the height (number of rows) of the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with a width of 3 columns and the height from the input grid.
3.  **Locate Green Square:** Identify the 2x2 green square in the input grid.  (Its position *does not* determine the output grid's size.)
4.  **Place Green Square:** Copy the 2x2 green square to the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.
5.  **Add Green Column:** Fill the entire rightmost column (index 2) of the output grid with green pixels (value 3).

The key change is that the output grid's height is now determined by the *input grid's height*, not by the location of the 2x2 green square within it. Also the current implementation works, but a revised, simpler implementation should be made.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
