observations:
  - task: "Identify and extract the borders of contiguous shapes."
  - objects:
      - name: shape
        description: "A contiguous block of pixels with the same non-zero color."
        properties:
          - color: "The color of the pixels in the shape (1-9)."
          - border: "The set of pixels within the shape that have at least one orthogonal neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that is either background (color 0) or outside the grid boundaries."
          - interior: "The set of pixels within the shape that are not on the border."
  - actions:
      - name: identify_shapes
        description: "Locate all contiguous shapes in the input grid."
      - name: determine_border
        description: "For each shape, identify its border pixels based on orthogonal adjacency to background or grid edge."
      - name: create_output
        description: "Construct an output grid where only the border pixels of each shape retain their original color, and all other pixels are set to background (color 0)."
  - context: "The input grid contains one or more shapes. The output grid contains only the borders of these shapes."
