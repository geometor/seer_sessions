Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of pixels, each representing a colored image. The primary colors observed are:

*   **0 (White):** Background color.
*   **6 (Magenta):** Forms a shape in the upper part of the grid.
*   **2 (Red):** Forms a shape in the lower part of the grid.

The transformation appears to modify the position or contents of some of the magenta pixels, but keep the red shape unchanged. There is one major object for each color, with some pixels related to lines or curves.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: magenta_shape
    color: 6 (magenta)
    type: irregular
    initial_position: top_half
    properties:
      - connected: true
  - id: red_shape
    color: 2 (red)
    type: irregular
    initial_position: bottom_half
    properties:
      - connected: true

actions:
  - type: modify
    target: magenta_shape
    description: "Shift pixels on the leftmost and rightmost columns of the magenta shape one step to the right or left, respectively, as long as it keeps the object connected"

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [magenta_shape, red_shape]
    description: "vertically_separated"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate two distinct shapes: a magenta (color 6) shape in the upper portion and a red (color 2) shape in the lower part.

2.  **Preserve Red Shape:** Do not alter anything about the red colored shape.

3.  **Modify Magenta Shape:**
    *   Inspect the leftmost pixel of the magenta object, if the right adjacent position is white, and shifting will keep the object connected, move this pixel one unit to the right.
    *   Inspect the rightmost pixel of the magenta object, if the left adjacent position is white, and shifting will keep the object connected, move this pixel one unit to the left.

In essence, The transformation maintains the red shape while applying a very small adjustment to the magenta shape to move the outermost pixels inwards by one unit, only when the movement will keep the magenta shape connected.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
