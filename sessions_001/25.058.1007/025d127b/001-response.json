The primary elements are colored regions or \"objects\" within the grid. The transformation appears to selectively remove parts of these objects. Specifically, it seems to remove the \"innermost\" pixels of the colored objects, leaving only the outer \"border\" pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Consider each of these regions as a separate \"shape\".\n\n2.  **Define Border:** For each shape, identify its \"border\" pixels. A border pixel is a non-zero pixel that has at least one neighboring zero-valued pixel (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n\n3.  **Remove Interior:** Remove all \"interior\" pixels. Interior pixels are those which are not border cells.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid, identical in size to the input grid. Copy only the border pixels of each identified shape to the corresponding positions in the output grid. All other pixels in the output grid should be 0.\n"
