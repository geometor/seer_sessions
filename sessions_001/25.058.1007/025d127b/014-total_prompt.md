Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, most of which are white (0) and some of which are azure (8). The azure pixels form a connected shape, resembling a diagonal line or a rotated "L". The transformation seems to involve a slight shift or modification of the azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x8 (rows x columns)
      elements: pixels
      colors:
        - 0: white
        - 8: azure
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: azure
      connectivity: contiguous
      description:  A connected shape of azure pixels.

actions:
  - type: modify
    target: shape
    description: The shape's azure pixels are changed. It seems like only a part of an outside edge is preserved.

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description:  Azure pixels are adjacent to each other, forming the shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Shape:** Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Edge:** Keep the edge of the shape and remove the inside. Start at row 1, move to the right keeping one azure. Next row keep one. Follow this pattern.

3. **Clear other Pixels:** Set all other azure pixels that are inside the edge to white (0).

In short - find the azure shape and hollow it out, keeping a small part of the edge.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
