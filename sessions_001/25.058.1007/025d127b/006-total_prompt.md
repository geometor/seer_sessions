Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the results, and updated documentation:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of extracting borders of shapes. However, the `find_border` function has a flaw: it only considers a pixel to be a border pixel if *any* of its neighbors (including diagonals) are background (value 0).  This is too strict. A pixel is part of the border if *at least one* of its *orthogonal* neighbors (up, down, left, or right) is background or outside the grid. The diagonal neighbors should not solely determine border status. The provided code and natural language description needs refinement to correctly define "border". The results demonstrate that diagonal adjacency is not the correct condition to be using. The use of an added break was premature optimization, and incorrect - so will need to be removed.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Border Definition:** Modify the `find_border` function to check *only* orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) when determining if a pixel is on the border.
2.  **Re-evaluate Natural Language Program:**  Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the corrected border definition.
3. **Re-test**: test after modifications

**Metrics and Example Analysis (using Code Execution):**

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    predicted_grid = np.array(predicted_grid)

    input_shapes = find_shapes(input_grid)
    output_shapes = find_shapes(output_grid)
    predicted_shapes = find_shapes(predicted_grid)

    input_shape_count = len(input_shapes)
    output_shape_count = len(output_shapes)
    predicted_shape_count = len(predicted_shapes)
    
    correct_pixels = np.sum(output_grid == predicted_grid)
    total_pixels = output_grid.size
    accuracy = correct_pixels / total_pixels if total_pixels > 0 else 0.0

    print(f"  Input Shape Count: {input_shape_count}")
    print(f"  Output Shape Count: {output_shape_count}")
    print(f"  Predicted Shape Count: {predicted_shape_count}")
    print(f"  Pixel Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Find all contiguous shapes in the input grid. A shape is defined as a group of connected pixels of the same non-zero color.  Pixels are considered connected if they are orthogonally (up, down, left, right) or diagonally adjacent.
2.  **Identify Border Pixels:** For each identified shape, determine its border. A pixel is part of the border if it has at least one orthogonally adjacent neighbor (up, down, left, or right) that is either a background pixel (color 0) or is outside the bounds of the input grid.
3.  **Create Output:** Construct the output grid.  Initialize it as all zeros (background color).  For each shape, copy the color of its border pixels from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid. All other pixels in the output grid remain as 0.

The crucial change is in step 2, clarifying the "orthogonal" adjacency rule for border pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
