task: 39e1d7f9
observations:
  - description: "The input and output grids are identical."
    type: comparison
    details: "Across all training examples, comparing the input grid to the expected output grid reveals no differences."
  - object: red_shape
    color: 2
    properties:
      stability: "The red shape remains unchanged between the input and output."
      count: "There is always one connected red object."
  - object: magenta_shape
    color: 6
    properties:
      relationship: "The magenta shape always completely surrounds the red shape."
      connectivity: "The magenta shape maintains its connectivity (forms a single, connected object)."
      pixel_count: "The number of magenta pixels remains constant."
  - action: identify_no_op
    description: "The transformation doesn't alter either the magenta or red shapes."
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
