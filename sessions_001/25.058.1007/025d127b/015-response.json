            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies connected azure (8) shapes. However, the \"preserve edge\" logic is flawed and doesn't accurately capture the intended transformation. The \"keep one, remove one\" approach is too simplistic and based on an incorrect assumption about where to keep the azure pixel. The examples show a consistent pattern of preserving a specific *corner* of the azure shape, not just an arbitrary edge pixel. The strategy needs to shift from preserving an arbitrary edge to identifying and preserving the correct corner pixel.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Shape Identification:** The `get_azure_shape` function is working correctly, so we can keep it.\n2.  **Corner Identification:** Instead of a generic edge preservation, we need to determine the specific corner pixel to keep. By observing the provided examples, we can discern if a rule will let use determine which corner pixel will be preserved.\n3.  **Precise Clearing:** After identifying the corner, clear *all other* azure pixels.\n4.  Test and iterate using an improved Natural Language Program.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo understand the pattern, let's analyze each example using a simplified representation focusing on the azure shapes and their transformation. We'll denote the preserved pixel with `[x]`.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    ```\n    Input:       Output:\n    8 8 8        0 0 0\n    8 8 8  ->    0 0 0\n    8 8 8        8 0 0\n    ```\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    ```\n    Input:       Output:\n    8 8          0 8\n    8 8    ->    0 0\n    ```\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    ```\n    Input:       Output:\n    8 8 8 8      0 0 0 8\n    8 8 8 8  ->  0 0 0 0\n    ```\n*   **Example 4:**\n    ```\n    Input:       Output:\n        8 8           0 8\n        8 8     ->    0 0\n    8 8 8 8       0 0 0 0\n    ```\n*   **Example 5:**\n    ```\n    Input:       Output:\n    8 8 8          0 0 8\n      8 8    ->    0 0 0\n    ```\nFrom a visual review it appears as if the preserved pixel is the top-right\npixel of the azure colored object.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: azure_shape\n    color: azure (8)\n    type: connected_shape\n    properties:\n      - corners: [top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_shape\n    description: Locate the connected azure shape in the grid.\n  - name: identify_corner\n    description: Determine the top-right corner of the azure shape.\n  - name: preserve_corner\n    description: Keep the identified top-right corner pixel as azure.\n  - name: clear_other\n    description: Change all other azure pixels within the shape to white (0).\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify:** Find the connected shape of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Locate Top-Right Corner:** Within the identified shape, locate the top-right corner pixel. The top-right corner is defined as the pixel within the shape that has the maximum column index and, among pixels with the same maximum column index, has the minimum row index.\n3.  **Preserve:** Keep the color of the top-right corner pixel as azure (8).\n4.  **Clear:** Change the color of all other azure pixels in the shape to white (0).\n"
