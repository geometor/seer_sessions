The primary element appears to be vertical bars of a single color (represented by the digit '5' in the input, and digits '1','2','3', '4' in the output, which all are grey in the input). The transformation seems to recolor these bars, while all of the grey pixels not part of the columns become white (0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A vertical bar is defined as a contiguous sequence of grey (5) pixels extending downwards in a single column.\n2. **Background to White:** All pixels that have value 0 or that are grey pixels (value 5) that are not part of any identified vertical bars are turned to white (0).\n3.  **Recolor Vertical Bars:** Each vertical bar is assigned a new color. Iterate through the columns from left to right, start with the first one blue (1), the second to be red (2), the third is green (3) and the fouth is yellow (4). If there are more vertical bars after that, repeat this color assignment rule (start from blue (1))\n4.  **Output:** Generate the output grid with the recolored vertical bars and the white background.\n\n"
