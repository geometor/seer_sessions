A segment is one or more vertically adjacent gray pixels. Record the start and end position, and length of each segment.\n\n2.  **Sort Segments by Length:** Sort the identified segments by their length in descending order (longest segment first).\n\n3.  **Assign Colors Based on Rank:** Assign colors to the segments based on their sorted rank:\n    *   Longest segment (rank 1): blue (color 1)\n    *   Second longest segment (rank 2): red (color 2)\n    *   Third longest segment (rank 3): green (color 3)\n    *   Fourth longest segment (rank 4): yellow (color 4)\n    *   All other segments: retain their original color (no change).\n\n4.  **Transform Pixels:** Iterate through the pixels of each identified segment.  Replace the gray (color 5) with the assigned color based on the segment's rank. Pixels not part of a gray vertical segment remain unchanged.\n\n5.  **Output:** Create an output grid with the transformed pixel colors.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_vertical_segments(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds all contiguous vertical line segments of a specified color.\"\"\"\n    segments = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for j in range(cols):\n        in_segment = False\n        start_row = -1\n        for i in range(rows):\n            if grid[i, j] == color:\n                if not in_segment:\n                    in_segment = True\n                    start_row = i\n            elif in_segment:\n                in_segment = False\n                segments.append(((start_row, j), (i - 1, j)))  # (start, end)\n                start_row = -1\n        if in_segment:  # Handle segment at the end of the column\n            segments.append(((start_row, j), (rows - 1, j)))\n    return segments\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find vertical line segments of gray (5) pixels\n    gray_segments = find_vertical_segments(input_grid, 5)\n\n    # Sort segments by length in descending order\n    segment_lengths = [(seg, (seg[1][0] - seg[0][0] + 1)) for seg in gray_segments]\n    sorted_segments = sorted(segment_lengths, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Assign colors sequentially based on rank\n    color_map = {\n        0: 1,  # Rank 1: blue\n        1: 2,  # Rank 2: red\n        2: 3,  # Rank 3: green\n        3: 4,   # Rank 4: yellow\n    }\n\n    # change output pixels\n    for rank, (segment, length) in enumerate(sorted_segments):\n        start, end = segment\n        start_row, start_col = start\n        end_row, end_col = end\n        new_color = color_map.get(rank, 5) # Default to gray (5) - no change\n        if new_color != 5: # only replace gray pixels\n              for i in range(start_row, end_row + 1):\n                output_grid[i, start_col] = new_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
