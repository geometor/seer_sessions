The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Identify Crosses:** Locate the two "cross" shapes in the input grid. These are identified by a central magenta (6) pixel surrounded by four azure (8) pixels in a cross pattern.

2.  **Transform to Squares:** For each cross:
    *   Expand the azure (8) pixels outwards to form a 3x3 filled square of azure pixels.
    *   Replace the central magenta(6) pixel of original with an azure (8).

3.  **Border Replication:** Replicate the magenta pixels:
     * The central magenta now appears at each corner of the azure squares.
     * The original magenta pixel and its horizontal neighbors are duplicated to above and below the expanded azure square.
     * The original magenta pixel and its vertical neighbors are duplicate to the left and right of the expanded azure square.
     * Replicate the magenta at the corners (top, bottom, left, right)

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, and it appears they don't fully generalize to the other examples. The core idea of identifying "crosses" and expanding them into squares is partially correct, but the replication of the magenta pixels around the expanded square is not consistent across all examples. The initial approach was too specific, over-fitting to the details of the first training case.

My strategy to resolve these errors will involve the following steps:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will examine each input-output pair and the code's output, noting precisely where the discrepancies occur. This will involve looking for patterns in *how* the magenta pixels are replicated, and if it's related to their original positions relative to the azure "cross."

2.  **Object Identification and Properties:** I'll clearly define what constitutes an "object" in these grids. It seems like we're dealing with crosses (initially) and squares (after expansion), but also with individual magenta pixels that have their own behavior.

3.  **Relational Reasoning:** The most crucial part will be understanding the *relationship* between the initial magenta pixels and their final positions. Are they simply mirrored? Are they copied based on distance from the center of the cross? Is there a bounding box concept involved?

4.  **Iterative Refinement:** I'll start by modifying the natural language program to reflect a more general rule, then regenerate the code, and re-test. It's likely that multiple iterations will be needed.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

Since I am unable to run code, the following analysis relies on manual visual inspection of each pair.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x5 grid with one cross.
    *   Expected Output: 5x7 with an expanded azure square and correctly replicated magenta border.
    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.

*   **Example 2:**
    *    Input: 7x7 grid
    *   Expected Output: 9x9 grid
    *    Actual output: Does not match
         - Missing magenta pixel at [1,1]
         - Missing magenta pixel at [1,7]
         - Missing magenta pixel at [7,1]
         - Missing magenta pixel at [7,7]

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 11 x 11 grid
    *   Expected: 13 x 13 grid
    *   Actual output: Does not match
         - Missing magenta pixel at [1,5]
         - Missing magenta pixel at [1,7]
         - Missing magenta pixel at [11,5]
         - Missing magenta pixel at [11,7]

**YAML Fact Documentation**

  - type: cross
    description: A pattern consisting of a central magenta pixel surrounded by four azure pixels in orthogonal directions.
    properties:
      center_color: 6  # Magenta
      arm_color: 8   # Azure
      initial_size: 5 pixels (1 center + 4 arms)

  - type: square
    description: The expanded form of the cross.
    properties:

  - type: magenta_pixel
    description: Individual magenta pixels that are part of the border and get replicated.
    properties:
      color: 6
      replication_rule: "Determined by position relative to the initial cross"
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Crosses:** Locate all "cross" shapes in the input grid. A cross is defined as a central magenta (6) pixel surrounded by four azure (8) pixels, one in each orthogonal direction (up, down, left, right).

2.  **Expand to Squares:** For each identified cross:
    *   Replace the entire 3x3 area centered on the cross's original magenta pixel with azure (8) pixels. This creates a 3x3 azure square.

3. **Replicate Magenta Pixels (Simplified Rule):**
     - Find the bounding box that contains the initial "cross."
     - Identify all the magenta pixels that constitute the border.
     - Replicate the border around the expanded azure square. The expanded border size should be original border size + 2.
     - Ensure corner pixels are included.

This revised natural language program attempts to generalize the magenta replication rule by introducing the concept of the border of the cross which can be expanded, and shifts the focus from individual pixel manipulation to a more holistic border-based approach.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
