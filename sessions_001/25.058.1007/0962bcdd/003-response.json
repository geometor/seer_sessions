The first shape consists of 7s surrounding a single 2, the whole shaped like a plus. It's on the upper left. The other shape is the same pattern but located in the bottom right.\n*   The output grid seems to expand these original shapes, with some additional 0 and 2 pixels. The 7s expand into the shape of an open rectangle/square, and the 2's seem to form connections.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
