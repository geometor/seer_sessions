A plus-shaped object is defined as a contiguous set of orange (7) pixels forming a '+' shape, with a single red (2) pixel at its geometric center. The center must have exactly 4 orange pixels as neighbors.\n2.  **Expand Plus Shapes:** For each identified plus shape, expand it outwards by one pixel in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) creating a hollow rectangle. The outline of this expanded shape consists of orange (7) pixels. The original red (2) pixel at the center of the plus shape should remain unchanged. This creates the smallest rectangle that encompasses the plus shape.\n3.  **Fill Between Expanded Shapes:** Fill the area *between* the orange edges of the expanded shapes with red (2) pixels.  This fill should extend up to, but not overwrite, the orange (7) pixels forming the borders of the expanded shapes. The fill operation does *not* fill the entire image or any area not enclosed by orange borders. The original red center pixels are *not* filled over.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_plus_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds plus-shaped objects (7s surrounding a 2).\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, obj):\n        if not is_valid(r, c) or visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] not in (2, 7):\n            return\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        obj.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, obj)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, obj)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, c)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, c)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 7 and not visited[r, c]:\n                obj = []\n                dfs(r, c, obj)\n                # Check if it's a plus shape with a 2 in the center\n                if any(grid[row, col] == 2 for row, col in obj):\n                   is_plus = True\n                   center = None\n                   for row,col in obj:\n                       if grid[row,col] == 2:\n                           if center is not None:\n                               is_plus = False\n                               break # only 1 center of 2 allowed\n                           else:\n                               center = (row,col)\n                   if is_plus:\n                        orange_neighbors = 0\n                        if center:\n                            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                                nr, nc = center[0] + dr, center[1] + dc\n                                if is_valid(nr,nc) and grid[nr,nc] == 7:\n                                     orange_neighbors += 1\n                        if orange_neighbors == 4:\n                            objects.append(obj)\n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(plus_object):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the bounding box for a plus object.\"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c = plus_object[0]\n    max_r, max_c = plus_object[0]\n    for r, c in plus_object:\n        min_r = min(min_r, r)\n        min_c = min(min_c, c)\n        max_r = max(max_r, r)\n        max_c = max(max_c, c)\n    return min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c\n\ndef expand_plus(grid, plus_object):\n    \"\"\"Expands the plus object to its bounding box and colors it orange.\"\"\"\n    min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = get_bounding_box(plus_object)\n    expanded_object = []\n\n    for r in range(min_r - 1, max_r + 2):\n        for c in range(min_c - 1, max_c + 2):\n             expanded_object.append((r,c))\n    return expanded_object\n\n\ndef fill_between_objects(grid, expanded_objects):\n    \"\"\"Fills the area between expanded objects with red (2)\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Create a set of all expanded object coordinates\n    all_expanded_coords = set()\n    for obj in expanded_objects:\n        for r, c in obj:\n            all_expanded_coords.add((r,c))\n            \n    min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = rows, cols, 0, 0\n\n    #get combined bounding box of all expanded objects\n    for r,c in all_expanded_coords:\n        min_r = min(min_r, r)\n        min_c = min(min_c, c)\n        max_r = max(max_r, r)\n        max_c = max(max_c, c)\n            \n    # Flood fill algorithm starting from each edge, stopping at orange pixels\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    \n    def is_valid(r,c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n    \n    def fill(r,c):\n      if not is_valid(r,c) or visited[r,c] or grid[r,c] == 7 or (r,c) in all_expanded_coords:\n        return\n    \n      visited[r,c] = True\n      grid[r,c] = 2\n      \n      fill(r+1,c)\n      fill(r-1,c)\n      fill(r,c+1)\n      fill(r,c-1)\n      \n\n    #top edge\n    for c in range(cols):\n        if is_valid(0, c):\n           fill(0, c)\n           \n    #bottom edge\n    for c in range(cols):\n       if is_valid(rows-1, c):\n          fill(rows-1, c)\n    \n    #left edge\n    for r in range(rows):\n      if is_valid(r, 0):\n        fill(r, 0)\n        \n    #right edge\n    for r in range(rows):\n      if is_valid(r, cols-1):\n        fill(r, cols - 1)\n        \n    #fill internal areas\n    for r in range(rows):\n      for c in range(cols):\n          if is_valid(r,c) and not visited[r,c] and (r,c) not in all_expanded_coords:\n              if grid[r,c] != 7:\n                  grid[r,c] = 2\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n  \"\"\"Transforms the input grid based on the plus shape expansion and fill rule.\"\"\"\n  grid = np.array(input_grid)\n  output_grid = np.copy(grid)\n\n  # 1.
