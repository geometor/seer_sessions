Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 12x12 grids.
*   The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0-9, though only 0, 2, and 7 are present).
*   The input grid has two distinct "shapes" or "objects" formed by the 7s and 2. The first shape consists of 7s surrounding a single 2, the whole shaped like a plus. It's on the upper left. The other shape is the same pattern but located in the bottom right.
*   The output grid seems to expand these original shapes, with some additional 0 and 2 pixels. The 7s expand into the shape of an open rectangle/square, and the 2's seem to form connections.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify "plus-shaped" objects:** Find connected components of 'orange' (7) pixels in the input grid that form a plus shape, with a single 'red' (2) pixel in the center.

2.  **Expand the plus-shapes:** For each identified plus-shaped object, transform the orange (7) pixels into a hollow rectangle or square shape. The shape should expand outwards.

3.  **Connect the expanded shapes** Place 'red' (2) pixels between two shapes. These red pixels form two separate diagonals connecting all 4 corners of the original shapes.

4. Fill in the area between plus-shaped objects with lines of "red" (2). The "red" (2) lines fill the two newly formed diagnols.
