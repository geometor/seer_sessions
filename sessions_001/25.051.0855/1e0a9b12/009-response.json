The colors and positions are detailed in `input_observations`.\n\n2.  **Predicate:** The color and position of each cell are the key predicates.\n\n3.  **Action - Row shift**:\n      - All non-zero cells move to the bottom row of their corresponding column.\n      - The relative vertical order within each column must be preserved.\n\n4.  **Overall Transformation:** The transformation adheres to the previously established rule: \"Move all non-zero colored cells to the bottom-most available row within their respective columns, maintaining their relative order, and fill the remaining cells with zeros.\"\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransformation Rule: Move all non-zero colored cells to the bottom-most available row within their respective columns, maintaining their relative order, and fill the remaining cells with zeros.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving non-zero cells to the bottom of their columns.\n    \n    Args:\n        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.\n        \n    Returns:\n        list of lists: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each column\n    for j in range(cols):\n        # Extract non-zero elements and their original row indices\n        column_elements = []\n        for i in range(rows):\n            if input_grid[i, j] != 0:\n                column_elements.append((i, input_grid[i, j]))\n        \n        # Place elements at the bottom of the output column\n        for k, (original_row, value) in enumerate(column_elements):\n            output_grid[rows - len(column_elements) + k, j] = value\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```\n"
