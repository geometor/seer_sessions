Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
input_observations:
  - object_1: [9, at (0,5)]
  - object_2: [8, at (1,3)]
  - object_3: [4, at (3,0)]
  - object_4: [4, at (4,0)]
  - object_5: [7, at (4,2)]
  - object_6: [8, at (4,3)]
  - object_7: [4, at (5,0)]
  - object_8: [7, at (5,2)]
  - colors: {0: 28, 9: 1, 8: 2, 4: 3, 7: 2}
  - dimensions: [6x6]

output_observations:
  - object_1: [4, at (3,0)]
  - object_2: [4, at (4,0)]
  - object_3: [7, at (4,2)]
  - object_4: [8, at (4,3)]
  - object_5: [4, at (5,0)]
  - object_6: [7, at (5,2)]
  - object_7: [8, at (5,3)]
  - object_8: [9, at (5,5)]
  - colors: {0: 28, 4: 3, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9:1}
  - dimensions: [6x6]
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains eight distinct objects, each represented by a single colored cell. The colors and their positions are noted in `input_observations`.

2.  **Predicate:** For each object, its color and initial position are its key predicates.

3. **Action- Row shift:**
      - All of the non-zero elements are moved down within their columns
      - We preserve the order.

4. **Overall transformation**
   - The rule moves all non-zero elements to the bottom of the grid, to the last available rows.
   - Within each column, non-zero cells stack from bottom, mantaining the original relative order.

In summary, we apply the same rule we found before.
"Move all non-zero colored cells to the bottom-most available row within their respective columns, maintaining their relative order, and fill the remaining cells with zeros."
