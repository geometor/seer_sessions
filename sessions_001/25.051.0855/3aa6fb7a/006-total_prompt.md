Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   We see two distinct objects made of color 8 (azure):
        *   One object is a vertical line of length 2 in the second column.
        *   Another object is a horizontal line of length 2 in the fourth row, starting from the fifth column.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

*   **Output Grid:**
    *   The azure objects (color 8) remain in the same positions.
    *   Two new cells with color 1 (blue) are present:
        *   One is adjacent to the top of the vertical azure line.
        *   One is adjacent to the left of the horizontal azure line.

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Vertical Line Rule:** For each vertical line object of color 8, place a color 1 (blue) cell directly above the top cell of the object. Do not add color 1 if a colored cell other than color 0 is above.
3.  **Horizontal Line Rule:** For each horizontal line object of color 8, place a color 1 (blue) cell directly to the left of the leftmost cell of the object. Do not add color 1 if a colored cell other than color 0 is to the left.
4.  **Preserve:** Keep the original color 8 objects in their original positions.
5. **Background:** The background (color 0) is preserved in all other cells.

**YAML Summary:**

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the second example.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   Three distinct objects made of color 8 (azure):
        *   A horizontal line of length 2 in the first row, starting at the fifth column.
        *   A vertical line of length 2 in the third column, starting at the third row.
        * A horizontal line of length 2 in the seventh row, starting at the fourth column.
        * A vertical line of length 1 in the sixth column and second row.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with color 0 (white).

*   **Output Grid:**
    *   The azure objects (color 8) remain in the same positions.
    *   Three new cells with color 1 (blue) are present:
        *   One is adjacent to the left of the horizontal azure line on the first row.
        *   One is adjacent to the top of the vertical azure line on the third column.
        * One is adjacent to the left of the horizontal azure line on the seventh row.

**Natural Language Program:**

Here's a step-by-step description of the transformation, which is identical in logic to the first example:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Vertical Line Rule:** For each vertical line object of color 8, place a color 1 (blue) cell directly above the top cell of the object. Do not add color 1 if there isn't color 0 above the object.
3.  **Horizontal Line Rule:** For each horizontal line object of color 8, place a color 1 (blue) cell directly to the left of the leftmost cell of the object.  Do not add color 1 if there isn't color 0 to the left.
4.  **Preserve:** Keep the original color 8 objects in their original positions.
5. **Background:** The background (color 0) is preserved.

**YAML Summary:**

transformation_rules:
  - description: |

```

The provided Python code from the first example correctly implements this transformation rule and will therefore also work for this second example. No changes are needed to the code.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
