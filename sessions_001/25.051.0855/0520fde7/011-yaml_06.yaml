task: 010-py_07
summary: |
  The task involves extracting a 3x3 subgrid from the input.  The center of this subgrid
  corresponds to the vertically middle gray pixel in the input. The transformation
  modifies this 3x3 subgrid. The central pixel of the subgrid is always turned red.
  Additionally, pixels that were gray in the input, and are directly above or below
  the central gray pixel, are ALSO turned red, but ONLY if they would fall inside the 3x3 subgrid.
  All other cells within the 3x3 extracted subgrid are white. The output grid is always 3x3.
objects:
  - object_1:
      type: pixel
      color: gray (5)
      properties:
        - vertically middle
        - center of 3x3 subgrid
  - object_2:
      type: pixel
      color: any
      properties: all pixels within the 3x3 region
  - object_3:
      type: pixel
      color: red (2)
      properties: center of the output subgrid
  - object_4:
          type: pixel
          color: red (2)
          properties: vertical neighbours of the gray pixel in the input IF and ONLY if the neighbour is in the output
