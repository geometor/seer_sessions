Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 2
      position: [(2, 6), (7,1)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: [(3, 2), (6,6)]
      shape: single cell
  dimensions: (9, 9)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 8
      position: (0, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 2
      position: [(2, 6), (7,1)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: [(3, 2), (6,6)]
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4
      position: [(1, 5), (1, 7), (3,5), (3,7), (5,0), (5,2), (8,0), (8,2)]
      shape: L shape
    - color: 7
      position: [(2,2),(3,2),(3,1),(3,3),(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(6,7)]
      shape: cross
  dimensions: (9, 9)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** The input grid has:
    *   One azure object (color 8) at (0, 3).
    *   Two red objects (color 2) at (2, 6) and (7, 1).
    *   Two blue objects (color 1) at (3, 2) and (6, 6).

2.  **Introduce New Objects:**
    *   Yellow (color 4) "L" shapes appear near each of the red objects.
    *   Orange crosses (color 7) is placed around each of the blue objects.

3.  **Object Placement Rule:**
    * Each red object gets a yellow "L" placed relative to it. The L's position changes from the first example to this one, keeping the objectness.
    * Each blue object has an orange cross centered on its original location.

**Transformation Rule Summary**

Each single red object in the input gets a yellow "L" shape as its shadow. Each single blue object in the input gets an orange cross shape surrounding it. The azure object remains unchanged.

def find_object(grid, color):
    # Find the position of a single-cell object with the given color.
    positions = np.argwhere(grid == color)
    # Return all positions, not just the first one
    return positions if positions.size > 0 else []

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the positions of the red objects (color 2).
    red_positions = find_object(input_grid, 2)
    for red_pos in red_positions:
        # Create yellow "L" shape relative to each red object.
        output_grid[red_pos[0] - 1, red_pos[1] - 1] = 4
        output_grid[red_pos[0] - 1, red_pos[1] + 1] = 4
        output_grid[red_pos[0] + 1, red_pos[1] - 1] = 4
        output_grid[red_pos[0] + 1, red_pos[1] + 1] = 4

    # Find the positions of the blue objects (color 1).
    blue_positions = find_object(input_grid, 1)
    for blue_pos in blue_positions:
        # Create an orange cross around each blue object.
        output_grid[blue_pos[0] - 1, blue_pos[1]] = 7
        output_grid[blue_pos[0] + 1, blue_pos[1]] = 7
        output_grid[blue_pos[0], blue_pos[1] - 1] = 7
        output_grid[blue_pos[0], blue_pos[1] + 1] = 7

    return output_grid
