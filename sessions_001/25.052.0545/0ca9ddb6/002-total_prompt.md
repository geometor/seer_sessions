Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
  dimensions: (9, 9)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (3, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (6, 6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4
      position: [(2, 1), (2, 3), (4,1), (4,3)]
      shape: L shape x 2
    - color: 7
      position: [(5,6),(6,6),(6,5),(6,7),(7,6)]
      shape: cross
  dimensions: (9, 9)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** In the input grid, we have two single-cell objects: one red (color 2) at position (3, 2) and one blue (color 1) at position (6, 6).

2.  **Introduce New Objects:**
    *   Two yellow (color 4) "L" shapes are introduced. The "L" can be thought as a 2x2 square missing a cell.
    *   One is located at (2,1), (2,3), (4,1), (4,3).
    *   One cross shape (color 7) is placed around the blue object (6,6) in the output.
   

3.  **Object Placement Rule:**
    *    The red object created the top yellow "L"
    *    The blue object is the center of the new orange object.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
The single red object in the input gets a yellow object as its "shadow".
The single blue object in the input gets an orange "cross" surrounding it.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
