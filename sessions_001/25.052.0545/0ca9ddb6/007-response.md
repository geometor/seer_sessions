Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in this third example.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (2, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (7, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 6
      position: (5,6)
      shape: single cell
  dimensions: (9, 9)

output_grid:
  objects:
    - color: 2
      position: (2, 2)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 1
      position: (7, 3)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 6
      position: (5,6)
      shape: single cell
    - color: 4
      position: [(1, 1), (1, 3), (3,1), (3,3)]
      shape: L shape
    - color: 7
      position: [(6,3),(7,3),(7,2),(7,4),(8,3)]
      shape: cross
  dimensions: (9, 9)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Initial Objects:** The input grid has:
    *   One red object (color 2) at (2, 2).
    *   One blue object (color 1) at (7, 3).
    *   One magenta object (color 6) at (5,6).

2.  **Introduce New Objects (or modify based on color):**

    *   A yellow (color 4) "L" object is added relative to the red object (2,2).
    *  An orange cross object(color 7) is added, centered at the location of the original blue object (7,3).
    *  The magenta object is unchanged.

3.  **Object Placement Rule:**
    *   The red object gets an yellow "L" shape placed relative to it.
    *  The blue object gets an orange "cross" shape placed, centered on it.

**Transformation Rule Summary**
Each single red object in the input gets a yellow "L" shape as its shadow. Each single blue object in the input gets an orange cross shape surrounding it. Other single objects remain unchanged.

```python
"""

Other single objects remain unchanged.

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    for red_pos in red_positions:
        # Create yellow "L" shape relative to each red object.
        output_grid[red_pos[0] - 1, red_pos[1] - 1] = 4
        output_grid[red_pos[0] - 1, red_pos[1] + 1] = 4
        output_grid[red_pos[0] + 1, red_pos[1] - 1] = 4
        output_grid[red_pos[0] + 1, red_pos[1] + 1] = 4

    for blue_pos in blue_positions:

        output_grid[blue_pos[0], blue_pos[1] - 1] = 7
        output_grid[blue_pos[0], blue_pos[1] + 1] = 7

    return output_grid
