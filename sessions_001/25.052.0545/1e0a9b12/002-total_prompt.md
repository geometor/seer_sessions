Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block Observation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 4x4
    objects:
      - color: 0 (white)
        count: 12
        shape: background
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        count: 2
        shape: isolated cells
        positions: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        count: 1
        shape: isolated cell
        position: [(0, 3)]
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        count: 1
        shape: isolated cell
        position: [(2, 2)]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        count: 1
        shape: isolated cell
        position: [(3, 0)]
  output_grid:
    size: 4x4
    objects:
      - color: 0 (white)
        count: 12
        shape: background
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        count: 2
        positions: [(2,1), (3,1)]
      - color: 6 (magenta)
        count: 1
        position: [(3, 2)]
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        count: 1
        position: [(3, 3)]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        count: 1
        position: [(3, 0)]

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Non-Background Objects:** First, we identify all the non-white (non-zero) colored cells in the input grid. These are our objects of interest: yellow (4), maroon (9), magenta (6), and blue (1).

2.  **Object Preservation and Reordering:** We see those objects or those colors persist in the output grid.

3.  **Shift Down:** All identified objects move to the last row of the output grid.

4. **Preserve Order by Column:** The order of objects from left to right in the output grid is given by their initial column in the input grid. That means:
    - The blue cell (1) from input column 0 remains in column 0.
    - The yellow cells (4) from input column 1 go to column 1.
    - The magenta cells (6) from input column 2 go to column 2.
    - The maroon cells (9) from input column 3 go to column 3.

5. **Fill Remaining:** Any cells not occupied by the shifted objects are filled with white (0).

In summary, the transformation rule involves shifting all non-white objects to the last row, preserving their original column order, and filling the remaining cells with white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
