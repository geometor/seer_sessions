These are our objects of interest: yellow (4), maroon (9), magenta (6), and blue (1).\n\n2.  **Object Preservation and Reordering:** We see those objects or those colors persist in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Shift Down:** All identified objects move to the last row of the output grid.\n\n4. **Preserve Order by Column:** The order of objects from left to right in the output grid is given by their initial column in the input grid. That means:\n    - The blue cell (1) from input column 0 remains in column 0.\n    - The yellow cells (4) from input column 1 go to column 1.\n    - The magenta cells (6) from input column 2 go to column 2.\n    - The maroon cells (9) from input column 3 go to column 3.\n\n5. **Fill Remaining:** Any cells not occupied by the shifted objects are filled with white (0).\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves shifting all non-white objects to the last row, preserving their original column order, and filling the remaining cells with white.\n"
