The input grid contains two distinct non-zero colored pixels (azure and gray) against a background of white pixels. The output grid shows that the non-zero colors have expanded. The azure color expands horizontally, filling the entire row it occupies, while also appearing at the far end of the row below and the far end of two rows below the original. The gray expands to fills its row.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
