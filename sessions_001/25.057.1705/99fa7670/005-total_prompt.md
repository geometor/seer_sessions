    return np.sum(grid1 != grid2)

# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)
examples = [

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was likely based on a very simple observation from the first example (extending a colored pixel to the right).  The subsequent examples demonstrate that this rule is not universally applicable.  Specifically, example 2 shows a similar "extension" but also involves filling *two* pixels to the right of the original non-zero pixel, which contradicts a strict "one pixel to the right" rule. Example 3 shows the extension does not always happen. Therefore, a more nuanced rule is needed, one that accounts for cases where the extension doesn't occur.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Identify Consistent Features:** We need to find features that are consistent across *all* examples, including when changes do *not* occur. A key observation seems to be that the extension only occurs horizontally and only when triggered by certain colors. The height of the colored pixel seems to be a factor too.
2.  **Conditional Logic:** The refined rule will likely involve conditional logic (if-then statements).  "IF a pixel is color X AND condition Y is met, THEN extend it to the right; OTHERWISE, leave it unchanged."
3.  **Hypothesis Testing:** We'll formulate a hypothesis, translate it into a natural language program, and then implicitly test it via a new python program against *all* training examples.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, noting the key features and discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Expected: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`
    *   Actual: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1]]`
    *   Mismatches: 1
    *   Observation: The blue (1) pixel in the second row is extended one pixel to the right. The generated code incorrectly filled the pixel below it.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0,0,0,3]]`
    *   Expected: `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0,0,0,3]]`
    *   Actual: `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 0], [0,0,0,3]]`
    *   Mismatches: 1
    *   Observation: The red (2) pixel in the second row is extended one pixel to the right. The generated code incorrectly extends down. The green pixel remains unchanged.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`
    *   Expected: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`
    *   Actual: `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0],[0,0,0,0,0]]`
    *   Mismatches: 1
    *   Observation: The magenta (6) pixel is not extended. The orange (7) is not extended. The generated code incorrectly extended magenta.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All possible colors
      row: int  # Row index
      col: int  # Column index
    actions:
      - name: extend_right
        conditions:
          - "color == 1 or color == 2"
          - row == 1 #note: zero indexed
        parameters:
          length: 1  # Number of pixels to extend to the right
      - name: no_change
        conditions:
          - "color != 1 and color !=2"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  For each pixel, check its color.
3. If a pixel is blue (1) or red (2) AND it is in the second row (index 1): extend the pixel to the right by one position, changing the color of the cell to the right.
4.  Otherwise, the pixel remains unchanged.
5. Output the modified grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
