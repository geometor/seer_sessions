The input grid appears to be a 3x3 matrix containing single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix, also containing single-digit integers. The core transformation seems to involve expanding and repositioning the contents of the input grid within the output grid. There's a clear spatial relationship; the input grid seems to be replicated in the top-right and bottom-left corners of the output grid, rotated. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros (white).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
