    details: |
      The input grid is replicated twice within the output grid.
      One replication is placed in the top-right corner.
      Another replication is placed at bottom-left coner.
      The source is rotated 90 degrees clock-wise at top-right.
      The source is rotated 270 degrees clock-wise or 90 counter clock-wise at bottom-left
