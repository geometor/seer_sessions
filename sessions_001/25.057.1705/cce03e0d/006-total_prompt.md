Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is embedded into a larger output grid. The output grid's dimensions are determined by multiplying the input grid's dimensions: the output width is twice the input width plus one, and the output height is three times the input height. The input grid is placed at the top-left corner of the second 'band' of rows, and the rest of the grid is filled with white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get input dimensions
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Calculate output dimensions
    output_height = input_height * 3
    output_width = input_width * 2 + 1

    # Create an output grid filled with white (0).
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Calculate the starting row index for embedding.
    start_row = input_height
    start_col = 0

    # Embed the input grid into the output grid.
    output_grid[start_row:start_row + input_height, start_col:start_col + input_width] = input_grid

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved embedding the input grid within a larger output grid. The dimensions of the output grid were calculated based on the input, and the input was placed at a specific location. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this transformation rule doesn't hold universally. Some examples show different embedding strategies or no embedding. The strategy now is to carefully observe each input-output pair, identify objects and patterns, and develop a rule which accounts for the variation. We need to account for:

1.  **Output Grid Dimensions:** Determine the correct calculation, if any or identify unique shape based rules.
2.  **Input Grid Placement:** Determine if a consistent embedding rule, like center, corner, offset, or mirror is used.
3.  **Additional Elements:** Check if any other shapes or patterns are introduced in the output that are not in the input, like a border, fill or repeating shape.

**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis)**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations from using `code_execution` to get grid shapes and visualize the results:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Shape:** (3, 5)
*   **Output Shape:** (9, 11)
*   **Result of running current program on input:** Pass
*   **Observations:** The initial rule works perfectly here. Input is embedded at row 3, column 0 within a larger grid, and the output dimensions match the described rule (height \* 3, width \* 2 + 1).

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Shape:** (3, 3)
*   **Output Shape:** (9, 7)
*    **Result of running current program on input:** Pass
*   **Observations:** Similar to example 1, the rule holds. Embedding is at (3, 0).

**Example 3:**

*   **Input Shape:** (5, 5)
*   **Output Shape:** (15, 11)
*    **Result of running current program on input:** Pass
*   **Observations:** The size rule has some issues, the width does not follow the width * 2 + 1 pattern, the input is embeded at (5, 0)

**Example 4:**

*   **Input Shape:** (7, 9)
*   **Output Shape:** (21, 19)
*    **Result of running current program on input:** Pass
*   **Observations:** Similar to example 1, 2, and 3, the height * 3 pattern holds but width rule is failing again, the input grid is embedded at (7,0)

**Example 5:**

*   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)
*   **Output Shape:** (21, 15)
*    **Result of running current program on input:** Pass
*   **Observations:** Similar to example 1, 2, 3 and 4, height * 3 pattern is constant, width rule is failing, the input grid is embedded at (7,0)

**Natural Language Program**

The output grid's height is three times the input grid's height. The output grid's width is equal to the input grid's width, plus the number of example pairs. The input grid is embedded into the output grid starting at a row index equal to the input grid's height and a column index of 0. The rest of the output grid is filled with white (color 0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
