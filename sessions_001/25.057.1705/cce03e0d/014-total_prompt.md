## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 1 2
0 2 1
2 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x777851443ED0>

**output:**
```
2 1 2 0 0 0 2 1 2
0 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 1
2 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0
0 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0
2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x777851443250>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (9x9). The smaller grid appears to be replicated and tiled within the larger grid, with the addition of '0' (white) pixels filling the spaces between the replications. The colors within the original grid are preserved. The transformation seems to involve a form of patterned replication or expansion.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Input grid dimensions
      colors: [0, 1, 2] # White, Blue, Red
    role: input

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9, 9]  # Output grid dimensions
      colors: [0, 1, 2] # White, Blue, Red
    role: output

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 0  # White
    role: filler
actions:
    - name: replicate
      description: copy the original grid
    - name: tile
      description: arrange the copies in output grid
    - name: insert
      description: place filler pixels in gaps

relationships:
  - subject: input grid
    predicate: is replicated and tiled to form
    object: output grid
  - subject: filler pixel
    predicate: fills spaces between
    object: replicated grids
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Replicate:** Make multiple copies of the input 3x3 grid.
2. **Tile:** Arrange these copies in a 3x3 pattern to form the outline of the 9x9 output grid. This means placing copies of the input grid at positions (0,0), (0,6), (3,3), and (6,0), (6,3), and (6,6) in the output grid. These coordinates represent the top left corners.
3. **Fill:** Fill all remaining (empty) cells in the 9x9 output grid with '0' (white pixels).

Essentially, the input grid acts as a tile that is repeated to partially construct a larger grid. The process appears to use coordinate multiplication by the factor of 3, creating a 3 fold expansion.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
