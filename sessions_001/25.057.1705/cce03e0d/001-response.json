The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 9x9. The colors present in the input are blue (1), red (2), and white (0). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with the original input grid appearing in the center-left portion of the larger grid. All other cells in the output grid are white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

In this case, 9 / 3 = 3.\n\n2. **Create Output Grid:** Create an empty grid (all white/0) with the dimensions of the output grid (9x9).\n\n3.  **Embed Input:** Copy the input grid into the output grid. The top-left corner of the input grid should be placed at row index `output_height / 3` and column index `0` within the output grid. Specifically, the start row is `9 / 3 = 3` which represents index 3 of the grid(starting at 0).\n    and the input data will fill the range of rows from 3 inclusive to 6 exclusive, and columns 0 inclusive to 3 exclusive.\n\n"
