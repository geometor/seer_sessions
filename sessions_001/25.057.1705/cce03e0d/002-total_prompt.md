## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 0 0
2 1 0
0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7778514422B0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x777851398870>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 9x9. The colors present in the input are blue (1), red (2), and white (0). The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with the original input grid appearing in the center-left portion of the larger grid. All other cells in the output grid are white (0).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 9x9.
  - observation: Output grid is 3 times larger than the input grid in both dimensions.
  - observation: Input grid colors are blue (1), red (2), and white (0).
  - observation: Output grid primarily consists of white (0) pixels.
  - relationship: The input grid appears to be embedded within the output grid.
  - location:  The input grid is located at the top-left of a 3x3 subgrid, itself starting on row 4, column 1 of the output grid
  - operation: Expansion or padding of the input grid to a larger size.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Expansion Factor:** Calculate the expansion factor by dividing the output grid size by the input grid size. In this case, 9 / 3 = 3.

2. **Create Output Grid:** Create an empty grid (all white/0) with the dimensions of the output grid (9x9).

3.  **Embed Input:** Copy the input grid into the output grid. The top-left corner of the input grid should be placed at row index `output_height / 3` and column index `0` within the output grid. Specifically, the start row is `9 / 3 = 3` which represents index 3 of the grid(starting at 0).
    and the input data will fill the range of rows from 3 inclusive to 6 exclusive, and columns 0 inclusive to 3 exclusive.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
