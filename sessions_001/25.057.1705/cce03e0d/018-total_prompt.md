Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of tiling the input grid to create the output grid. The scaling factor was calculated based on the ratio of output to input dimensions. However, the code doesn't always correctly predict the output size, and therefore the tiling. The loop with `example` variable setting arbitrary output dimensions is incorrect and needs to be removed. We should determine the correct output size based on observations across *all* examples. It appears the core concept of replication/tiling is valid, but the logic to determine the scaling factor (and thus the output dimensions) needs refinement. The strategy will be to:

1.  Analyze each input/output pair to precisely determine the relationship between their dimensions.
2.  Look for a consistent pattern in how the input is scaled to create the output.
3.  Refine the natural language program and subsequently the code to reflect the correct scaling logic.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**

I'll use manual analysis supplemented by conceptual code execution (without the environment to actually run code, I'll describe what code *would* be used and the results it would produce).

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3, Output: 6x6. Scaling: 2x, 2x.
    *   Result: Correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 1x1, Output: 30x30. Scaling: 30x, 30x
    * the code sets an arbitrary output of (30,30)
    *   Result: Correct.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 1x2, Output: 30x30
    * the code sets an arbitrary output of (30,30)
    * the code produced 30 x 60 by deriving scale from calculated output
    *   Result: Incorrect. Output should be tiled to fill 30 x 30.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 3 x 5, Output: 6 x 10
    * the code sets an arbitrary output of (6, 10)
    *   Result: Correct
*   **Example 5:**
    * Input: 7 x 10, output 14 x 20
    * the code sets an arbitrary output of (14, 20)
    * Result: Correct

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_shape: [3, 3]
  output_shape: [6, 6]
  x_scale: 2
  y_scale: 2
  transformation: "Replicate input 2x in both dimensions"
example_2:
  input_shape: [1, 1]
  output_shape: [30, 30]
  x_scale: 30
  y_scale: 30
  transformation: "Replicate input 30x in both dimensions"
example_3:
  input_shape: [1, 2]
  output_shape: [30, 30]
  x_scale: 30
  y_scale: 15
  transformation: "Replicate input such that the output dimensions are 30x30."
example_4:
  input_shape: [3, 5]
  output_shape: [6, 10]
  x_scale: 2
  y_scale: 2
  transformation: "Replicate 2x in both dimensions"
example_5:
  input_shape: [7, 10]
  output_shape: [14, 20]
  x_scale: 2
  y_scale: 2
  transformation: "Replicate 2x in both dimensions"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid dimensions are either a multiple of the input dimensions or are always 30x30, prioritizing 30 x 30 if applicable. Specifically:
    * if any dimension of the input grid is 1 and the corresponding output dimension is 30, scale factor is 30
    * Otherwise, multiply each dimension by two.
2. **Replication:** Replicate the input grid by the determined x and y scaling factors by repeating the entire input grid content. Tile these replications to fill the output grid.

Revised and combined:

The output size is determined as follows: If the input grid has a dimension of 1 and any corresponding output grid dimension is 30, the output dimensions will be 30x30. The input is replicated to fill the output dimensions. Otherwise, the output dimensions are double the input dimensions, and the input grid is replicated twice in each dimension.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
