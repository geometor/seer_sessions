        [[1,0,0],
        [0,1,0],
        [0,0,1]]
        ```
    * Output:
        ```
        [[4,0,0],
        [0,2,0],
        [0,0,1]]
        ```
    *  Previous code would now predict:
        ```
        [[2,1,4],
         [1,4,2],
         [4,2,1]]
        ```

If these were my examples, I would produce reports/metrics like this (using a hypothetical `analyze_example` function â€“ I can't actually execute code here):
