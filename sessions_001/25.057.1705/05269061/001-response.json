The input grid contains a pattern of red, azure, and green pixels (represented by the numbers 2, 8, and 3, respectively) in the top-left corner, with the rest of the grid being white (0). The output grid appears to be a checkerboard-like expansion of this initial pattern. The white pixels seem to act as a background and are replaced by the alternating pattern.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, it's a 3x3 region (although only 3x1 contains values) with red (2), azure (8), and green (3).\n\n2.  **Checkerboard Expansion:**  This core pattern is expanded into a checkerboard pattern across the entire grid. Extend the 3x1 pattern by tiling. All zeros are replaced by the appropriate value to complete the repeating tile pattern.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replaces the white (0) pixels with the repeating 3x1 pattern of red, azure, and green to create the checkerboard effect.\n"
