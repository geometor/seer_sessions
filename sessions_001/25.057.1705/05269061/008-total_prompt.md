## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 1 2
0 0 0 0 1 2 4
0 0 0 1 2 4 0
0 0 1 2 4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x777851443E30>

**output:**
```
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
4 1 2 4 1 2 4
1 2 4 1 2 4 1
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
4 1 2 4 1 2 4
1 2 4 1 2 4 1
2 4 1 2 4 1 2
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of digits (representing colors) into another grid of digits. The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of non-zero digits expanding from the top-right corner, while the output grid has a repeating checkerboard-like pattern of the digits 1, 2, and 4. The input uses 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow) and the output only uses 1 (blue), 2(red), and 4 (yellow). The dimensions of the grids are the same (7x7).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
      - value: 2
        color: red
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
    pattern: diagonal expansion from top-right

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
      - value: 2
        color: red
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
    pattern: repeating checkerboard of 1, 2, and 4

  - relation:
      type: transformation
      from: input grid
      to: output grid
      rule: replace input pattern with checkerboard pattern
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Ignore the input grid's specific digit pattern.** The input's diagonal structure and values are irrelevant to the transformation.
2.  **Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (7x7).**
3.  **Fill the output grid with a repeating 3-color (1, 2, 4) checkerboard pattern.** Specifically:

    *   Start with 2 in cell (0,0) and 4 in cell (1,0), 1 in cell (2,0) and then repeat this 3 number sequence across each row.
    *   For subsequent rows, shift this sequence by one. Start the next row at the next number in sequence and wrap back around to 1 if necessary.
    *   I.e., Output\[row, col] = value, where the 'value' is determined as described by an infinite sequence that is a circular shift, based on (row) and the pattern 2, 4, 1.

In simpler terms, the transformation discards the input pattern and generates a predefined, repeating 3-color checkerboard pattern in the output grid, ensuring the output grid matches the dimensions of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
