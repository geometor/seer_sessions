Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation discards the input pattern and generates a predefined, repeating 3-color (1, 2, 4) checkerboard pattern in the output grid, ensuring the output grid matches the dimensions of the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as the input grid
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)

    # define the repeating pattern
    pattern = [2, 4, 1]

    # fill the output grid with the checkerboard pattern
    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            # calculate the index in the pattern based on row and column
            pattern_index = (row + col) % 3
            output_grid[row, col] = pattern[pattern_index]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
