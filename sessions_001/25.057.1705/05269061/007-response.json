The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of non-zero digits expanding from the top-right corner, while the output grid has a repeating checkerboard-like pattern of the digits 1, 2, and 4. The input uses 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow) and the output only uses 1 (blue), 2(red), and 4 (yellow). The dimensions of the grids are the same (7x7).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Start the next row at the next number in sequence and wrap back around to 1 if necessary.\n    *   I.e., Output\\[row, col] = value, where the 'value' is determined as described by an infinite sequence that is a circular shift, based on (row) and the pattern 2, 4, 1.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation discards the input pattern and generates a predefined, repeating 3-color checkerboard pattern in the output grid, ensuring the output grid matches the dimensions of the input grid.\n"
