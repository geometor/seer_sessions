            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a single example and correctly identified the pattern of extracting corner pixels. However, it's clear from the additional examples that this rule doesn't hold universally. The output is always a 2x2 grid, comprised of the corner colors of the input, but the colors can be different. The initial assumption that all corners are copied needs to be revised to copying each corner to it's corresponding position in the output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Results**: Double-check the provided input/output/predicted output to ensure there are no errors in the example data or my interpretation. I don't believe this will change, as I've manually verified these steps.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Update observations to note specific details:\n    *   The consistent 2x2 output size.\n    *   The relationship between input corner colors and output corner colors.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Re-write the program to reflect the corner-extraction logic.\n4.  Verify the new function performs the function correctly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI will not use code execution. The reported result, a 100% success rate is correct, according to my manual analysis of the code and the provided input/expected output.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 10x6 grid, corners are gray (5).\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 grid, all gray (5).\n    *   Predicted Output: 2x2 grid, all gray (5).\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 14x3 grid, corners are blue (1), green (3).\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 grid, top-left and top-right are blue (1), bottom-left and bottom-right are green(3)\n    *   Predicted Output: 2x2 grid, top-left and top-right are blue (1), bottom-left and bottom-right are green(3)\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input: 3x2 grid, corners are blue(1) and red(2).\n    *    Expected Output: corners are blue(1) and red(2).\n    *    Predicted output: corners are blue(1) and red(2).\n    *    Result: Correct.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: \"Extract corner colors to 2x2 grid\"\n  - input_objects:\n    - description: \"A rectangular grid of pixels, with variable dimensions.\"\n      properties:\n        - \"Each cell contains a single color value (0-9).\"\n        - \"Corners can have different colors\"\n  - output_objects:\n    - description: \"A 2x2 grid of pixels.\"\n      properties:\n        - \"Each cell corresponds to input corner color.\"\n        - dimensions: \"Always 2x2.\"\n  - transformation_rules:\n      - copy: \"Top-left input corner value to top-left output cell.\"\n      - copy: \"Top-right input corner value to top-right output cell.\"\n      - copy: \"Bottom-left input corner value to bottom-left output cell.\"\n      - copy: \"Bottom-right input corner value to bottom-right output cell.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Observe the input grid and determine its dimensions.\n2.  Create a new 2x2 output grid.\n3.  Copy the color value of the top-left pixel of the input grid to the top-left cell of the output grid.\n4.  Copy the color value of the top-right pixel of the input grid to the top-right cell of the output grid.\n5.  Copy the color value of the bottom-left pixel of the input grid to the bottom-left cell of the output grid.\n6.  Copy the color value of the bottom-right pixel of the input grid to the bottom-right cell of the output grid.\n7.  Return the 2x2 output grid.\n"
