Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the results of the preliminary `analyze_example` function. The function currently identifies and extracts non-blue and non-white pixels from both input and output grids, printing their locations and values. This is a good starting point for observing differences, but it doesn't yet capture the underlying transformation *rule*.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy of focusing on non-blue/non-white pixels is partially useful, as these pixels seem to be the core of the transformation. However, simply listing them doesn't reveal the spatial relationships and the overall logic. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids, suggesting a process of extraction or summarization. The provided code's output shows that the non-blue/non-white colors in the output correspond to non-blue/non-white colors in the input, but in a condensed format.

The strategy should shift towards:

1.  **Identifying the Region of Interest (ROI):** Determine how the region containing the relevant pixels is selected from the input grid. This might involve finding the bounding box of non-blue/non-white pixels, or a specific pattern defined by blue pixels.
2.  **Mapping Input to Output:** Once the ROI is defined, establish the precise mapping between the input ROI and the output grid. This might involve direct copying, color changes, or other manipulations.
3.  **Handling variations**: the ROI identification and mapping must work for different input shapes, locations, and color combinations

**Metrics and Observations (from code execution)**

Here's a summary of the code execution, focusing on the relevant details:

**Example 1:**

*   Input grid size: (10, 10)
*   Output grid size: (2, 2)
*   Input Non-blue/white pixels: `[(4, 4, 3), (4, 5, 2), (5, 4, 2), (5, 5, 3)]`
*   Output Non-blue/white pixels: `[(0, 0, 3), (0, 1, 2), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 3)]`
*   **Observation**: The output grid perfectly contains the colors of the non-blue and non-white input pixels within the blue "frame", and they are transposed.

**Example 2:**

*   Input grid size: (9, 10)
*   Output grid size: (3, 4)
*   Input Non-blue/white pixels: `[(3, 3, 7), (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 7), (3, 6, 7), (4, 3, 7), (4, 4, 2), (4, 5, 7), (4, 6, 8), (5, 3, 7), (5, 4, 7), (5, 5, 7), (5, 6, 7)]`
*   Output Non-blue/white pixels: `[(0, 0, 7), (0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 7), (0, 3, 7), (1, 0, 7), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 7), (1, 3, 8), (2, 0, 7), (2, 1, 7), (2, 2, 7), (2, 3, 7)]`
*   **Observation**: The output is a direct copy of the rectangular region of non-blue and non-white pixels.

**Example 3:**

*   Input grid size: (9, 9)
*   Output grid size: (3, 3)
*   Input Non-blue/white pixels: `[(3, 3, 5), (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 5), (4, 3, 5), (4, 4, 4), (4, 5, 5), (5, 3, 5), (5, 4, 5), (5, 5, 5)]`
*   Output Non-blue/white pixels: `[(0, 0, 5), (0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 5), (1, 0, 5), (1, 1, 4), (1, 2, 5), (2, 0, 5), (2, 1, 5), (2, 2, 5)]`
*   **Observation**: The output is a direct copy of the rectangular region of non-blue and non-white pixels.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: "The input grid contains a region of interest (ROI) defined by the contiguous block of non-blue and non-white pixels."
  - description: "The output grid represents a condensed or extracted version of the input grid's ROI."
  - description: "The output grid's dimensions match the dimensions of the input ROI."
  - description: "The pixel colors within the input ROI are directly copied to the output grid."
  - description: "Blue pixels (value 1) and white pixels (value 0) in the input grid seem to act as a frame or background, and are not included in the output."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest (ROI):** Find the smallest rectangular region within the input grid that encompasses all non-blue (non-1) and non-white(non-0) pixels. This is the bounding box of all the non-blue/non-white pixels.

2.  **Extract the ROI:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the same dimensions as the ROI.

3.  **Copy Pixels:** Copy the pixel values from the input grid's ROI to the corresponding positions in the output grid.

4.  **Ignore other Pixels:** Pixels outside the identified ROI in the input grid are ignored.
