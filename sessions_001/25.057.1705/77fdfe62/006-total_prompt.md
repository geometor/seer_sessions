Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved removing a blue border and condensing the remaining non-white pixels. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The code fails in some cases because it doesn't correctly identify and preserve the spatial relationships between the non-white and non-blue pixels. It also makes assumptions about the output grid size (4x4) that are not universally true. The core issue is that the code is extracting salient pixels but not maintaining all information needed to map them to their final output grid.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Revisit the White Region Logic:** The current `_is_part_of_white_region` function is too simplistic. We need a more robust way to distinguish between "background" white pixels and white pixels that are part of the core object(s).
2.  **Preserve Relative Positions:** Instead of just collecting salient pixels, we need to consider their original positions *relative to each other*. This suggests we might need to calculate offsets or relative coordinates.
3. **Determine output grid:** Instead of hardcoding the output size, infer the size and arrangement of the output grid dynamically, if possible.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We will use the training examples to incrementally refine the transformation logic, testing the code after each modification.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations and calculated properties using code execution.

    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    for r in range(input_rows):
        for c in range(input_cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] != 1 and input_grid[r,c] != 0:
                input_non_blue_non_white.append((r, c, input_grid[r,c]))

    output_non_blue_non_white = []

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Remove Border:** Remove any blue (1) pixels that form a border around the entire input grid.
2.  **Identify and Remove Background:** Remove white (0) pixels that are not part of the internal figure.
3.  **Extract Inner Figure:** Identify the remaining pixels, which constitute the "inner figure."
4. **Determine the arrangement and size:** Identify non-blue/white pixels in the output and note their size and positions
5.  **Condense and Preserve:** Create a new, smaller output grid based on the identified size and arrangement. Place the pixels of the inner figure into the output grid, preserving their relative positions and colors, as if the surrounding blue and white pixels had simply been removed and the figure "collapsed" inwards.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
