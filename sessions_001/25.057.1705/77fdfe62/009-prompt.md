Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extracts the values from the four corners of the input grid and creates a new 2x2 grid using those values, maintaining their relative positions.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by extracting the corner pixel values and
    creating a 2x2 output grid with those values.
    """
    # Get the dimensions of the input grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Initialize the output grid as a 2x2 numpy array
    output_grid = np.zeros((2, 2), dtype=int)

    # Extract the corner values from the input grid and populate the output grid
    output_grid[0, 0] = input_grid[0, 0]  # Top-left
    output_grid[0, 1] = input_grid[0, cols - 1]  # Top-right
    output_grid[1, 0] = input_grid[rows - 1, 0]  # Bottom-left
    output_grid[1, 1] = input_grid[rows - 1, cols - 1]  # Bottom-right

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
