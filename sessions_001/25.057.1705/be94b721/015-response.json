            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was designed to extract the largest contiguous block of azure (8) pixels. This worked perfectly for the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this is not the complete rule. The core issue is that the initial assumption (extracting the largest azure block) is too specific and doesn't generalize to all cases. We need to identify a more general rule that accounts for all the training examples. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each training example, focusing on the differences.\n2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for relationships between the input and output that hold true across *all* examples.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the more general rule. The current rule is a special case.\n4. Use code execution results to help determine the size and location of the\n   object.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including observations and potential metrics we could use:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 9x11 grid, contains a single azure (8) object of size 6x5.\n    *   Expected Output: 6x5 grid representing the azure object.\n    *   Actual Output: 6x5 grid representing the azure object.\n    *   Result: **Success**. The code correctly extracted the azure object.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 10x10 grid, with an azure (8) object and black(0) border pixels\n    *   Expected Output: 4x4 grid representing the azure object.\n    *   Actual Output: 6x6 grid - contains parts of the border\n    *   Result: **Failure**.\n        *   Observation: The azure object is smaller in each dimension by 2.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 12x11 grid, contains multiple azure (8) objects.\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 grid representing the top left\n    *   Actual Output: 10x10 - contains most of the original azure shapes\n    *   Result: **Failure**.\n        *   Observation: Only part of one the top left azure object is returned.\n\n* **Example 4**\n    * Input: 16x16, contains an azure border with a black object\n    * Expected Output: 12x14 representing the inside of the azure border\n    * Actual: 16 x 16 (the complete input)\n    * Result: **Failure**\n     * Observation: the code must remove the azure border - and that the shape\n       returned is not defined by the azure colored pixels, but instead bounded\n       by them\n\nBased on the analysis, the key focus should be on the relationship with the\nazure colored pixels and how they bound, contain or otherwise relate to the\noutput.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: rectangle\n        relationship: defines_output_region\n    output_objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: rectangle\n        notes: Matches the input azure object.\n    result: success\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: rectangle\n        relationship: border_around_output\n    output_objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: rectangle\n        notes:  azure object with outside removed\n    result: failure\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: multiple rectangles\n        relationship: contains_output_region\n    output_objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: rectangle\n    result: failure\n\n  - example_id: 4\n    input_objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: rectangle (border)\n        relationship: surrounds output\n    output_objects:\n      - color: \"black (0)\"\n        shape: rectangle\n        notes: The interior region within the azure border.\n    result: failure\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Determine Role of Azure:**\n    *   If there is only one azure region.\n        * if there are pixels surrounding the object, return the object\n          with the border removed\n        * otherwise return the complete shape\n    *   If there is an azure shape in the shape of a border:\n        * return the region *inside* the azure border.\n    * If there are multiple azure regions:\n        * Return the top-left azure shape, with the border removed\n\nThis program tries to generalize the observed behavior: the azure color defines\na boundary.\n"
