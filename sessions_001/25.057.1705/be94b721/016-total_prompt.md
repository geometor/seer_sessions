Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to extract the largest contiguous block of azure (8) pixels. This worked perfectly for the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this is not the complete rule. The core issue is that the initial assumption (extracting the largest azure block) is too specific and doesn't generalize to all cases. We need to identify a more general rule that accounts for all the training examples. The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each training example, focusing on the differences.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for relationships between the input and output that hold true across *all* examples.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the more general rule. The current rule is a special case.
4. Use code execution results to help determine the size and location of the
   object.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations and potential metrics we could use:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 9x11 grid, contains a single azure (8) object of size 6x5.
    *   Expected Output: 6x5 grid representing the azure object.
    *   Actual Output: 6x5 grid representing the azure object.
    *   Result: **Success**. The code correctly extracted the azure object.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 10x10 grid, with an azure (8) object and black(0) border pixels
    *   Expected Output: 4x4 grid representing the azure object.
    *   Actual Output: 6x6 grid - contains parts of the border
    *   Result: **Failure**.
        *   Observation: The azure object is smaller in each dimension by 2.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 12x11 grid, contains multiple azure (8) objects.
    *   Expected Output: 2x2 grid representing the top left
    *   Actual Output: 10x10 - contains most of the original azure shapes
    *   Result: **Failure**.
        *   Observation: Only part of one the top left azure object is returned.

* **Example 4**
    * Input: 16x16, contains an azure border with a black object
    * Expected Output: 12x14 representing the inside of the azure border
    * Actual: 16 x 16 (the complete input)
    * Result: **Failure**
     * Observation: the code must remove the azure border - and that the shape
       returned is not defined by the azure colored pixels, but instead bounded
       by them

Based on the analysis, the key focus should be on the relationship with the
azure colored pixels and how they bound, contain or otherwise relate to the
output.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: rectangle
        relationship: defines_output_region
    output_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: rectangle
        notes: Matches the input azure object.
    result: success

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: rectangle
        relationship: border_around_output
    output_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: rectangle
        notes:  azure object with outside removed
    result: failure

  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: multiple rectangles
        relationship: contains_output_region
    output_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: rectangle
    result: failure

  - example_id: 4
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: rectangle (border)
        relationship: surrounds output
    output_objects:
      - color: "black (0)"
        shape: rectangle
        notes: The interior region within the azure border.
    result: failure
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Role of Azure:**
    *   If there is only one azure region.
        * if there are pixels surrounding the object, return the object
          with the border removed
        * otherwise return the complete shape
    *   If there is an azure shape in the shape of a border:
        * return the region *inside* the azure border.
    * If there are multiple azure regions:
        * Return the top-left azure shape, with the border removed

This program tries to generalize the observed behavior: the azure color defines
a boundary.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
