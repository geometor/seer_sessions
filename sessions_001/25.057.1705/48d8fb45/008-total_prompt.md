## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0
0 4 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 0
0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7778516D1950>

**output:**
```
4 4 0
0 0 4
0 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x777851443CF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a larger grid (10x10) into a smaller grid (3x3). The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and yellow (4), with a single instance of gray (5) in the input, which disappears in the output. The yellow pixels appear to form a discontinuous shape in the input, and the output seems to extract a subset of these yellow pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
      - color: gray
        value: 5
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
  - observation: gray_pixel_disappears
    description: The gray pixel (5) in the input grid is not present in the output grid.
  - observation: yellow_pixel_subset
    description: The output grid contains a subset of the yellow pixels (4) from the input grid.
  - observation: relative_position
    description: the relative positions within the yellow cluster is preserved
  - action: extract_yellow_subgrid
    description: A 3x3 subgrid containing the yellow pixels at specific relative locations from input is extracted to form the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Subgrid Bounds:** Consider the relative locations of the yellow cluster, and extract a 3x3 sub-grid.
3. **Gray removal**: remove any instances of gray
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Place the extracted subgrid of yellow pixels within the sub-grid, preserving relative position. Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).

Essentially, the transformation identifies a cluster of yellow colored pixels, and creates a subgrid based on their relative position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
