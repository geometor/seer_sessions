            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code focused on extracting a 3x3 subgrid centered around a cluster of yellow pixels and removing gray pixels. This approach worked for the first example but failed on others. The core issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Assumption of a single cluster:** The code assumes a single, contiguous cluster of yellow pixels.  Other examples might have multiple, separate yellow pixels or regions.\n2.  **Rigid 3x3 grid:**  The code always returns a 3x3 grid. The output grid size should probably be more dynamic and related to the input, and certainly should not always remove gray pixels.\n3. **Focus on Yellow:** the problem statement did not explicitly state what the\n   focus should be. It may be an object, a color, a relationship, or any\n   combination. We'll need to evaluate this.\n\nThe strategy to address these issues will involve:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluating Object Identification:** Instead of focusing solely on yellow, we need to identify *all* potential objects and their properties (color, shape, position). The prompt does not give us a clear focus, so we need to look at all examples.\n2.  **Dynamic Output Size:** The output grid size should be determined by the input and the transformation rule, not fixed at 3x3.\n3.  **Generalized Transformation:** Instead of hardcoding the extraction of a yellow cluster, we need to discern a more general rule that applies to all examples. This might involve identifying a specific object or region based on certain criteria and replicating it in the output.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis**\n\nTo get accurate metrics and solidify my understanding, I need the input and output grids. I will now request the code_execution tool to show me the input and output grids for each example.\n\n```tool_code\ntask.show_examples(mode='grid', tasks=['6d0aefbc'])\n```\n"
