## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7778516D1770>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of the same dimensions (6x9). The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). The input grid contains two distinct shapes, one azure and one yellow. The output grid appears to modify the azure shape while leaving the yellow shape untouched. Specifically, the azure shape seems to be "extended" or "filled" in certain directions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: azure_shape
    color: azure (8)
    type: contiguous_block
    initial_position:
      row_start: 0
      row_end: 2
      col_start: 3
      col_end: 5
    modified: true

  - id: yellow_shape
    color: yellow (4)
    type: contiguous_block
    initial_position:
      row_start: 3
      row_end: 5
      col_start: 3
      col_end: 5
    modified: false

actions:
  - type: fill
    object: azure_shape
    details: >
       The azure shape expands to the right. Where the border of the shape
       originally contained two horizontally adjacent azure pixels and
       there is a white pixel to the immediate right of this pair,
       the white pixel is changed to azure
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. These are our objects. In this specific example, we have an azure (8) object and a yellow (4) object.

2.  **Target Object:** The transformation rule focuses on the azure object.

3.  **Fill Rule**:
    The azure shape is expanded by finding adjacent azure pixels in the original shape.

    *   Two azure pixels are horizontally adjacent.
    *    Check the pixel to the right
    *   If the pixel is white, change it to azure.

4.  **Yellow shape rule:** The yellow object remains unchanged.

In essence, the program identifies colored shapes and applies a specific "filling" rule to the azure shape based on adjacent pixels, changing their colour from white to azure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
