The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). The input grid contains two distinct shapes, one azure and one yellow. The output grid appears to modify the azure shape while leaving the yellow shape untouched. Specifically, the azure shape seems to be \"extended\" or \"filled\" in certain directions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
