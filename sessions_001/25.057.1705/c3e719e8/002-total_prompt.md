## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 8 7
9 3 8
7 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7778516D1450>

**output:**
```
3 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0
9 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
7 9 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 8 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 9 3 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 9 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 7 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7778514432F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into a 9x9 grid. The original 3x3 grid appears to be replicated and tiled within the larger grid, with '0' (white) filling the remaining spaces. The replication pattern seems to be a 3x3 tiling of the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    role: source
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    role: target
  - type: operation
    description: replication
    details: The input grid is replicated 9 times in a 3x3 tiling pattern.
  - type: operation
    description: filling
    details: Spaces not occupied by the replicated input grid are filled with '0'.
  - type: relationship
    description: tiling
    details: output grid is a 3x3 tiling of the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an empty 9x9 output grid filled with 0s.
2.  **Replication:** Copy the 3x3 input grid.
3.  **Tiling:** Place the copied input grid into the output grid at the following positions, creating a 3x3 tiled pattern:
    *   Top-left (0,0)
    *   Top-center (0,3)
    *   Top-right (0,6)
    *   Middle-left (3,0)
    *   Middle-center (3,3)
    *   Middle-right (3,6)
    *  Bottom-left(6,0)
    *  Bottom-center(6,3)
    *  Bottom-right(6,6)

Essentially the program takes input grid and repeats is 9 times to create a 3x3 "meta-grid", with each element of this meta grid being one copy of the original input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
