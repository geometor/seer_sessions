            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code's logic is heavily reliant on the specific layout of the first training example. It assumes the existence of a vertical yellow line, and the placement of maroon and blue pixels is conditional on their position relative to this line. This approach works for some examples but fails for others where this specific structural pattern isn't present. The main issue is an over-reliance on absolute positioning and a lack of generalized object interaction rules. The code needs to shift from absolute positional rules to relative, object-based rules. We must identify a consistent relationship between object properties across all examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Clearly define the objects involved (e.g., colored pixels) and their relevant properties (color, relative position).\n2.  **Relationship Analysis:** Instead of relying on a \"yellow line,\" look for consistent relationships between the objects across all input-output pairs. It may be helpful to number the examples from 0.\n3.  **Generalized Rule:** Formulate a rule that describes how the input objects are transformed into the output, focusing on relative positions and object interactions, not absolute coordinates.\n4.   **Output Grid Size:** Verify the output grid size and initialization assumptions and make the necessary corrections.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo better understand the transformations, let's analyze each example and the code's output. I'll denote correct outputs as \"\u2705\" and incorrect ones as \"\u274c\".\n\n*   **Example 0**: \u2705 (The initial code was designed for this case)\n*   **Example 1**: \u274c\n    Input:\n    ```\n    [[4 4 4]\n    [4 4 4]\n    [9 4 1]]\n    ```\n\n    Expected Output:\n    ```\n    [[0 4 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]\n    [1 9 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]]\n    ```\n\n    Actual Output:\n    ```\n    [[0 4 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]\n    [1 9 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]]\n    ```\n\n*   **Example 2**: \u274c\n\n    Input:\n    ```\n    [[4 9]\n    [4 4]\n    [4 1]]\n    ```\n\n    Expected Output:\n\n    ```\n    [[0 4 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]\n    [1 9 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]]\n    ```\n\n    Actual Output:\n\n    ```\n    [[0 4 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]]\n\n    ```\n\n*  **Example 3**: \u274c\n\n   Input:\n    ```\n     [[1 9 4 4]]\n    ```\n\n    Expected Output:\n\n    ```\n    [[0 4 4 4]\n    [1 9 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]\n    [4 4 4 4]]\n    ```\n\n   Actual Output:\n\n    ```\n      [[0 4 4 4]\n      [4 4 4 4]\n      [4 4 4 4]\n      [4 4 4 4]]\n     ```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - example_0:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: vertical_line\n        - color: maroon\n          shape: single_pixel\n          relative_position: right_of_yellow_line, row_1\n        - color: blue\n          shape: single_pixel\n          relative_position: right_of_yellow_line, row_0\n      output_objects:\n        - color: black\n          shape: single_pixel\n          position: (0, 0)\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: filled_grid\n        - color: maroon\n          shape: single_pixel\n          position: (1, 1)\n        - color: blue\n          shape: single_pixel\n          position: (0, 0)\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: filled_grid\n        - color: maroon\n          shape: single_pixel\n          relative_position:  row_2, col_0\n        - color: blue\n          shape: single_pixel\n          relative_position: row_2, col_2\n      output_objects:\n        - color: black\n          shape: single_pixel\n          position: (0, 0)\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: filled_grid\n        - color: maroon\n          shape: single_pixel\n          position: (2, 1)\n        - color: blue\n          shape: single_pixel\n          position: (2, 0)\n  - example_2:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: vertical_line, col_0\n        - color: maroon\n          shape: single_pixel\n          relative_position: row_0, col_1\n        - color: blue\n          shape: single_pixel\n          relative_position: row_2, col_1\n      output_objects:\n          - color: black\n            shape: single_pixel\n            position: (0, 0)\n          - color: yellow\n            shape: filled_grid\n          - color: blue\n            shape: single_pixel\n            position: (2, 0)\n          - color: maroon\n            shape: single_pixel\n            position: (2,1)\n  - example_3:\n    input_objects:\n      - color: blue\n        shape: single_pixel\n        relative_position: row_0, col_0\n      - color: maroon\n        shape: single_pixel\n        relative_position: row_0, col_1\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: vertical_line, col 2 & 3\n    output_objects:\n      - color: black\n          shape: single_pixel\n          position: (0, 0)\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: filled_grid\n      - color: blue\n          shape: single_pixel\n          position: (1, 0)\n      - color: maroon\n        shape: single_pixel\n        position: (1,1)\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialize:** Create a 4x4 output grid and fill it entirely with yellow (color 4).\n2.  **Place Origin:** Place a black (color 0) pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.\n3.  **Input Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.\n4. **Object Identification within Row:** In the current row, identify the positions of the blue (1) and maroon (9) pixels, if present.\n5. **Conditional Placement in Output**\n    *   If a blue pixel is found, place a blue pixel in the output grid at column 0 of the row number *below* the input pixel's row index.\n    *    If a maroon pixel is found, place a maroon pixel in the output grid at column 1 of the row number *below* the input pixel's row index.\n6. **Skip Yellow:** Ignore yellow pixels.\n\n"
