    Transforms the input grid by selecting specific columns.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to select specific columns (1, 3, 9, and 12, zero-indexed, which became 0, 2, 8, 11 in the code) from the input grid. This approach works for the first training example, but it will likely fail for other examples with a different set of columns to be selected, a variable number of columns, or operations beyond column selection. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis is too specific and doesn't generalize. We need to shift our focus from *hardcoded column indices* to a more general rule for selecting *which* columns to extract, and potentially performing additional transformations.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine *all* provided training input/output pairs. We must not make assumptions based on a single example.
2.  **Identify the Column Selection Rule:** Determine the underlying logic that dictates which columns are chosen. Is it based on color? Position? A repeating pattern? The presence of other objects?
3.  **Look for additional transformations:** Examine if there any transformations other than simple column selection.
4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately and completely describe the general rule, encompassing *all* training examples.
5. **Prepare YAML and Natural Language Program**: Document actions on objects and produce a concise and testable program in natural language.

**Metrics and Observations (using conceptual code execution):**

Since I don't have direct code execution capabilities in this environment, I will simulate the process and provide the observations. For a real implementation, these would be obtained using `code_execution` calls.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (6, 14)
    *   Output Shape: (6, 4)
    *   Selected Columns (observed in code): 0, 2, 8, 11
    *   Result: `success` (according to the problem, the initial test passed). This needs to be confirmed with all examples.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)
    *   Output Shape: (5,2)
    *   Selected Columns (Hypothesized, need verification against code's output). It is improbable that columns 8 and 11 would be selected based on the output.
    * Let's imagine the hypothesis is changed to [0,2]. If that works, columns 0 and 2 were selected.
    *   Result: `hypothetical success` or `hypothetical failure` (Needs to be updated based on the output if the column selection is applied).
*   **Example 3:**
    * Input shape: (3, 5)
    * Output Shape: (3, 2)
    * Selected Columns: Same problem as example 2 - hypothesize [0,2] for now.
    * Result: `hypothetical success` or `hypothetical failure`.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: [6, 14]
      output_shape: [6, 4]
      selected_columns: [0, 2, 8, 11]  #from existing code
      result: success
  - example_2:
      input_shape: [5, 7]
      output_shape: [5, 2]
      selected_columns: [0, 2] #hypothetical
      result: unknown  # Placeholder, needs to be confirmed
  - example_3:
      input_shape: [3, 5]
      output_shape: [3, 2]
      selected_columns: [0,2] #hypothetical
      result: unknown  # Placeholder, needs to be confirmed
  - general:
    - action: select_columns
    - selection_rule: "Select columns 0 and 2 (zero-indexed) of input" #hypothetical
    - additional_transformation: none
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the input grid.
2.  **Select** columns 0 and 2 (zero-indexed) from the input grid.
3.  **Construct** a new grid consisting of the selected columns in the original row order.
4.  **Output** the new grid.

**Revised Assessment:**

Based on the provided code and the shapes of all the inputs, I suspect a simplified program of choosing columns 0 and 2 has been implemented. I have updated the yaml and Natural Language Program with this hypothetical transformation. The key next step is to see the actual output grids, or test results.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
