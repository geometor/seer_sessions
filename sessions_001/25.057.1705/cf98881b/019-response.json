            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves a transformation of a rectangular grid of colored pixels into a smaller rectangular grid. The colors are represented by digits 0-9. The output grid seems to be a condensed version of the input grid, retaining some, but not all, of the original colors and shapes. The most prominent colors in the input are yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output retains yellow (4), maroon (9), and blue (1), seemingly extracting a vertical \"slice\" of the input. It's not a simple sub-sampling or cropping, as the spatial relationships between colors are altered.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
