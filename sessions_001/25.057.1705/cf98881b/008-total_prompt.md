## Example 2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 2 9 0 9 0 2 0 0 0 1
4 4 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 2 1 0 0 0
4 0 4 4 2 0 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 2 0 0 9 0 2 1 0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x777851601770>

**output:**
```
4 4 4 4
4 4 0 0
4 1 4 4
1 0 9 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7778514423F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The colors and their arrangement in the output grid seem to be derived from the input grid, but the specific rule isn't immediately obvious. There's a reduction in the dimensions of the grid. There appear to be some sort of selection and filtering based on color and relative position of the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid
    dimensions: 4x14
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by digits 0-9

  - type: grid
    description: Output grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by digits 0-9

  - observation: dimension_reduction
    details: The output grid is smaller than the input grid.

  - observation: color_selection
    details:  The output grid only includes a subset of colors from input grid (4, 0, 9, 1). Colors 2 is present in the input grid and not present in the output.
  
  - action: extract_subgrid
    parameters: input, start_row, start_col, height, width
    description: "Selects a portion or a transformation of a portion of the input"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The colors present in the output grid are a subset of those in the input grid: 4 (yellow), 0 (white), 9 (maroon), and 1 (blue).

2.  **Locate Subgrid**: The output grid appears to be constructed by the values that are unique per column.

3.  **Construct output grid by unique values**: For example, in the first column of the input we see `[4, 4, 4, 0]`, `4` is the most frequent value, and it appears in the output column. If there are equal number of distinct values, use the other rule. In the last column of the input we see `[1, 0, 1, 0]` there are two `1` and two `0`. In this case we can find a corresponding column in the output, `[1, 0, 9, 0]` by alternating and starting with `1`.

4. **Final output**: The values from the identified columns form the output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
