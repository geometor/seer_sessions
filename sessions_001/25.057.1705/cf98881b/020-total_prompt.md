## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 9 2 0 0 0 0
4 4 0 4 2 9 0 9 0 2 0 0 0 0
4 0 4 4 2 0 9 9 0 2 1 1 0 1
0 4 4 4 2 0 9 0 0 2 1 1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x777851601770>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 4
4 4 9 4
4 9 4 4
1 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7778514432F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a rectangular grid of colored pixels into a smaller rectangular grid. The colors are represented by digits 0-9. The output grid seems to be a condensed version of the input grid, retaining some, but not all, of the original colors and shapes. The most prominent colors in the input are yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output retains yellow (4), maroon (9), and blue (1), seemingly extracting a vertical "slice" of the input. It's not a simple sub-sampling or cropping, as the spatial relationships between colors are altered.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [4, 14]  # height, width
      colors: [0, 4, 2, 9, 1] # white, yellow, red, maroon, blue
      objects:
        - color: 4 # yellow
          shape: irregular, but clustered on the left side
        - color: 2 # red
          shape: vertical line
        - color: 9 # maroon
          shape: vertical line, to the right of the red line
        - color: 1 # blue
          shape: clustered in the lower right corner
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [4, 4]
      colors: [0, 4, 9, 1]
      objects:
        - color: 4 #yellow
          shape: fills most of the grid except the first column of top row and the bottom-left
        - color: 9
          shape: two single pixels in second column
        - color: 1 # blue
          shape: one single pixel at bottom left
  - transformation:
      type: extraction and re-arrangement
      preserved_colors: [4, 9, 1]
      discarded_colors: [0, 2]
      spatial_relationship: output appears to be related to the 4th and some of the 9th and 13th columns of the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Focus on the 4th column from the left (all yellow (4)), the 9th column (maroon (9)), and the 13th column (blue (1)).

2. **Extract Relevant Pixels:** Select certain pixels from the specified columns:
  *   Extract from the 4th column all cells (all are yellow(4)).
  *   Extract from the 9th input column the 2nd and 3rd row elements (maroon(9)).
  *   Extract from the 13th input column the 3rd row element (blue(1)).

3. **Construct the output**: Create a new 4x4 grid.

4.  **Fill Output Grid:**
    *   Fill the all cells of output with yellow (4).
    *   Set the output at 2nd column 2nd row to be maroon (9).
    *   Set the output at 2nd column 3rd row to be maroon (9).
    *   Set the output at 1st column 4th row to be blue (1).
    *   Set the output at 1st column 1st row to be white (0).

In essence, the transformation extracts specific columns, picks selected elements and rearranges them into a smaller grid, primarily focusing on the yellow, maroon, and blue pixels and their relative positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
