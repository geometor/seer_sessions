Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts a 4x4 subgrid from the input grid. The subgrid
consists of the columns: 0, 1, 2, and 4. And in the case of duplicate values in
a column, such as columns 13 and 14, uses alternating values from that column,
starting with the top pixel.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts a 4x4 subgrid from the input grid based on column selection and value prioritization.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)

    # Define the columns we want to extract (0-indexed)
    selected_columns = [0, 1, 2, 4]

    # Iterate through the selected columns and populate the output grid
    for i, col_index in enumerate(selected_columns):

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
