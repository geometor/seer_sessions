"""
The transformation extracts the first column of the input grid. It identifies the non-yellow pixels
in this column. The output grid's first column is constructed by placing these non-yellow
pixels at the top, followed by an equal number of maroon (9) pixels, and finally filling the
remaining spaces with yellow (4) pixels. The rest of the output grid is filled with yellow (4).
The output grid is always 4x4.
