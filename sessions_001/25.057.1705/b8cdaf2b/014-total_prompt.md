## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 6 6 6 0
6 1 1 1 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7778516D1450>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 1
0 6 6 6 0
6 1 1 1 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x777869E5D450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and magenta (6). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x5). There's a noticeable change in a specific region of the grid, while other areas remain identical. The transformation seems localized.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 6]  # white, blue, magenta

  - type: region
    description: horizontal line of white pixels
    location: row 3 (index 2) in output grid
    properties:
        color_input: 0 #white
        color_output: [0,0,0,0,0]

  - type: region
    description: horizontal line
    location: row 4 (index 3)
     properties:
        color: 6 (magenta)

  - type: region
    description: corners
    properties:
        color: 6

  - type: region
    description: horizontal line segment
    location: row 5 (index 4)
    properties:
      inner_color: 1 (blue)
      outer_color: 6 (magenta)

actions:
  - type: change_color
    target: region at row 3 (index 2)
    details: >
       The two corner pixels are set to 1.
       All other values are set to 0.

relationships:
  - input_output_grids: same dimensions
  - changed_region: located within the grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify regions:** Locate a horizontal line of white pixels at row 3 of the input.
2.  **Modify Row 3:** Within this row, set the left and right most pixels to blue(1). Set the rest of the values in this row to 0.
3. **All Other Rows:** Maintain the state of all other rows, with no changes.

In essence, the transformation focuses on a single horizontal line, changing only two of the the white pixels to blue, while setting the rest to 0, leaving the rest of the grid unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
