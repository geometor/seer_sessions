Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Background:** Locate the bottom two rows of the input grid. These will remain unchanged.
2.  **Maintain Background:** Copy the identified two bottom rows directly to the output grid.
3.  **Construct rows to insert:**
    *   The first inserted row will be all 0.
    *   The second inserted row will be green (3) at opposite ends of the row, filling the remaining spaces with white (0).
    *   The third inserted row is the same at the second inserted row except the green elements (3) are adjacent to the end, filling the remaining spaces with white (0)
4.  **Combine:** insert the constructed rows at the top of the output.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the need to preserve the bottom two rows and construct new rows to insert at the top. However, it failed to generalize the pattern of the inserted rows across all training examples. The provided code assumed a fixed pattern (all zeros, green at ends, green adjacent to ends) which only holds for the first example. The other examples show variations in the inserted rows, particularly in the number of inserted rows, the colors used, and the positions of non-zero elements.

The core issue is that the code is too rigid and doesn't adapt to the variations present in the different training examples. We need a more flexible approach that can discern the specific pattern of inserted rows in each case.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair to determine the exact number and pattern of inserted rows. Pay close attention to the colors and positions of pixels in these rows.
2.  **Identify Common Principles:** Look for underlying rules that apply across all examples, even if the specific details vary. For instance, is there a consistent relationship between the inserted rows and the original top rows of the input?
3.  **Dynamic Row Construction:** Instead of hardcoding the inserted rows, the code should dynamically construct them based on the identified pattern for each example.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the more general and flexible transformation rule.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To help guide the code refinement, let's define some metrics and record observations. I'll use `code_execution` where it is easy to do.

*   **Number of Inserted Rows:** Count the difference in height between the input and output grids.
*   **Inserted Row Patterns:** Describe the color and position of non-zero pixels in each inserted row.
*  **Relationship to Input Top Rows** Check if the top rows of input are related to newly inserted rows.

**Example Analysis and YAML Documentation:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including YAML documentation:

**Example 1:**

    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
])
result_grid = transform(input_grid)
print(np.array_equal(result_grid, output_grid))
```

*   **Inserted Rows:** 3
*   **Inserted Row Patterns:**
    *   Row 1: All zeros.
    *   Row 2: Green (3) at both ends, zeros in between.
    *   Row 3: Green (3) one position from each end, zeros elsewhere.

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Preserve Background:** Copy the bottom two rows of the input grid directly to the output grid.
2.  **Determine Number of Rows to Insert:** The number of rows to insert is equal to the height of the input grid minus 2.
3. **Construct Inserted Rows:**
   *   Iteratively create new rows, starting with green (3) at opposite ends of the row and filling the rest with white (0).
   *    For each subsequent row, move the green pixels one position closer to the center.
   *   Stop when either the green pixels would overlap, or the number of rows to create is met.
4.  **Combine:** Insert the constructed rows at the top of the output grid.

This revised program accounts for the variable number of inserted rows and the consistent pattern of moving the green pixels towards the center. It is more general and should correctly transform all three training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
