            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the need to preserve the bottom two rows and construct new rows to insert at the top. However, it failed to generalize the pattern of the inserted rows across all training examples. The provided code assumed a fixed pattern (all zeros, green at ends, green adjacent to ends) which only holds for the first example. The other examples show variations in the inserted rows, particularly in the number of inserted rows, the colors used, and the positions of non-zero elements.\n\nThe core issue is that the code is too rigid and doesn't adapt to the variations present in the different training examples. We need a more flexible approach that can discern the specific pattern of inserted rows in each case.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair to determine the exact number and pattern of inserted rows. Pay close attention to the colors and positions of pixels in these rows.\n2.  **Identify Common Principles:** Look for underlying rules that apply across all examples, even if the specific details vary. For instance, is there a consistent relationship between the inserted rows and the original top rows of the input?\n3.  **Dynamic Row Construction:** Instead of hardcoding the inserted rows, the code should dynamically construct them based on the identified pattern for each example.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the more general and flexible transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo help guide the code refinement, let's define some metrics and record observations. I'll use `code_execution` where it is easy to do.\n\n*   **Number of Inserted Rows:** Count the difference in height between the input and output grids.\n*   **Inserted Row Patterns:** Describe the color and position of non-zero pixels in each inserted row.\n*  **Relationship to Input Top Rows** Check if the top rows of input are related to newly inserted rows.\n\n**Example Analysis and YAML Documentation:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including YAML documentation:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ninput_grid = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n])\noutput_grid = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n])\nresult_grid = transform(input_grid)\nprint(np.array_equal(result_grid, output_grid))\n```\n\n*   **Inserted Rows:** 3\n*   **Inserted Row Patterns:**\n    *   Row 1: All zeros.\n    *   Row 2: Green (3) at both ends, zeros in between.\n    *   Row 3: Green (3) one position from each end, zeros elsewhere.\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    -

type: grid\n       name: input_grid\n       properties:\n        dimensions: [5, 6]\n        bottom_rows:  [[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]\n     - type: grid\n       name: output_grid\n       properties:\n         dimensions: [4, 6]\n         top_rows_inserted:\n           -

It is more general and should correctly transform all three training examples.\n"
