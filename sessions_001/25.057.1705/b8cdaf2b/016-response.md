Okay, let's analyze the provided data and the results of the previously generated code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example and focused on identifying rows with a specific number of white (0) and blue (1) pixels. It correctly identified the transformation in the first example, where a row of all white pixels in the input becomes a row with two blue pixels at the ends and white pixels in the middle in the output. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this transformation only applies to the row with five white pixels, *and* that the specific row being acted on can be any row in the grid.. The code needs to be generalized to locate the row of white pixels in the input, and modify *only* that row in the output. The current implementation is too specific (looking at first row only), then is overly broad (looking at any row) and doesn't apply the full transformation (only identifies white and blue).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Row Identification:** Instead of assuming a specific row index, we need to dynamically identify the row(s) containing all white pixels (all zeros) in the input grid.

2.  **Apply Consistent Transformation:** The transformation rule should be consistently applied: any row with all white pixels is converted to have blue pixels at the first and last positions, with the remaining pixels being white.

3.  **Handle Multiple/No White Rows:** Consider cases where there might be multiple rows of all white pixels, or no such rows at all. The current code handles multiple rows.

**YAML Fact Gathering:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - shape: rectangular 2D array
      - values: integers representing colors (0-9)
    invariants:
      - all_examples_same_size: false
      - rows_with_all_white_are_transformed: True

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - shape: rectangular 2D array
      - values: integers representing colors (0-9)
    invariants:
       - size_invariant_with_input: True

  - action: row_transformation
    description: replace a row of all white pixels
    precondition:
      - input_grid: row contains only white pixels (0)
    postcondition:
      - output_grid: corresponding row has blue pixels (1) at the start and end, and white (0) pixels elsewhere

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find White Rows:** Iterate through each row of the input grid. For each row, check if all its pixels are white (value 0).

2.  **Transform White Rows:** If a row contains only white pixels, create a new row for the output grid. In this new row:
    *   Set the first and last pixels to blue (value 1).
    *   Set all other pixels in between to white (value 0).

3.  **Copy Unchanged Rows:** If a row in the input grid is not all white pixels, copy the row directly to the output grid without modification.

4.  **Output:** The output grid is composed of the transformed white rows and the copied unchanged rows.
