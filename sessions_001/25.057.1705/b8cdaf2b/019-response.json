The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve a combination of identifying existing shapes and creating new ones based on their positions. The output grid retains the bottom two rows of the input grid and adds two new yellow (4) pixels above each original yellow (4) pixel on the border of red region.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
