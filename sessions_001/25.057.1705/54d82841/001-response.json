The primary colors observed are white (0) and magenta (6). The output introduces a new color, yellow (4), in the last row. The magenta pixels appear to form two separate rectangular shapes in the top half of the grid. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Note the range of columns containing each of these objects.\n2. **Bottom Row Modification**: For the bottom row only, examine the locations where the column above contains a pixel belonging to one of the shapes identified in step one. In these columns, change the pixel color to yellow (4).\n3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the program identifies magenta colored objects in the grid, then adds new yellow pixels to the very bottom row, only in columns where magenta objects appear above.\n"
