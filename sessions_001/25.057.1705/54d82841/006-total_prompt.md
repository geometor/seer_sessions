"""
1.  **Identify Magenta Shapes:** Locate all contiguous blocks (shapes) of magenta (6) pixels within the input grid. Note the range of columns containing each of these objects.
2. **Bottom Row Modification**: For the bottom row only, examine the locations where the column above contains a pixel belonging to one of the shapes identified in step one. In these columns, change the pixel color to yellow (4).
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying magenta shapes and changing the color of pixels in the bottom row directly below them to yellow. The code successfully performs this transformation. However, the other examples reveal that this rule is not universally applicable. We need to revise our understanding to incorporate these cases. The strategy will involve the following:
1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair, noting the differences and similarities, especially where the current code fails. We'll focus on object identification and how the changes in the bottom row relate to those objects.

2.  **Code Execution:** Use a code cell to compute specific properties from the data.
3.  **Fact Documentation (YAML):** Create a YAML structure to document the facts about the transformation.

4.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately describe the transformation across *all* training examples.

**Metrics and Analysis**

        # Basic grid info
        input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
        output_rows, output_cols = expected_output_grid.shape

        # Compare expected and predicted outputs
        comparison = (expected_output_grid == predicted_output_grid)
        correct_pixels = np.sum(comparison)
        total_pixels = comparison.size  # Use .size for total elements, not shape
        accuracy = (correct_pixels / total_pixels) * 100 if total_pixels > 0 else 0.0

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Magenta Shapes:** Locate all contiguous blocks (shapes) of magenta (6) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Columns with Magenta:** Identify all columns that contain at least one magenta pixel, irrespective of the shape or row.
3. **Bottom Row Modification**: In the bottom row of the grid, change the color of *all* pixels that are in the columns identified in step 2 to yellow (4).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

The key change from the previous program is that we're no longer considering only the pixels *directly* below a magenta shape, but *any* pixel in the bottom row that shares a column with *any* magenta pixel anywhere in the input grid. This generalized rule accounts for all the provided examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
