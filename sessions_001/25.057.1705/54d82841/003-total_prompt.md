Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Magenta Shapes:** Locate all contiguous blocks (shapes) of magenta (6) pixels within the input grid. Note the range of columns containing each of these objects.
2. **Bottom Row Modification**: For the bottom row only, examine the locations where the column above contains a pixel belonging to one of the shapes identified in step one. In these columns, change the pixel color to yellow (4).
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
