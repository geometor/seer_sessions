## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x777851442AD0>

**output:**
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are white (0) and magenta (6). The output introduces a new color, yellow (4), in the last row. The magenta pixels appear to form two separate rectangular shapes in the top half of the grid. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 8
      columns: 8
      colors: [white, magenta, yellow]
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: magenta
      form: rectangular # appears to be, but not confirmed for all shapes
    instances: 2
    locations:
      - rows: [0, 1]
        columns: [1, 2, 3]
      - rows: [2, 3]
        columns: [5, 6, 7]

actions:
    - type: add_pixels
      properties:
        color: yellow
        location: bottom row
      constraints: below magenta shape columns.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Two magenta shapes are present in the top half of the grid.
  - type: spatial
    description: Yellow pixels are added to the last row. Yellow pixels are located only at columns that contain magenta shapes in the rows above.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Magenta Shapes:** Locate all contiguous blocks (shapes) of magenta (6) pixels within the input grid. Note the range of columns containing each of these objects.
2. **Bottom Row Modification**: For the bottom row only, examine the locations where the column above contains a pixel belonging to one of the shapes identified in step one. In these columns, change the pixel color to yellow (4).
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

Essentially, the program identifies magenta colored objects in the grid, then adds new yellow pixels to the very bottom row, only in columns where magenta objects appear above.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
