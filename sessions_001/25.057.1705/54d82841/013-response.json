The input grid transforms into the output grid based on some rule. The most obvious change is the addition of a new row at the bottom, containing yellow (4) pixels.  The placement of the yellow pixels seems related to the columns, and possibly to the absence of colors other than white (0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
