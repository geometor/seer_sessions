"""
The transformation rule identifies a vertical line object in the input grid and transforms it into a horizontal line object in the output grid. The color of the object is preserved. The top-left corner of the bounding box of the input object maps to the top-left corner of the bounding box of the output object. The length of the horizontal line in the output corresponds to either the length of the vertical line, or in the case of example 3, is one pixel longer.
