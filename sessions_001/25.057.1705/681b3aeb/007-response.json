The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: yellow (4) and magenta (6). The output grid combines these regions in a compact, altered arrangement. The white pixels (0) in the input seem to be ignored, acting as background.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In this case identify the yellow (4) and magenta (6) regions.\n2.  **Isolate:** Mentally separate these colored regions from the white background.\n3.  **Relative Positioning:** Observe the original relative positions. Yellow is to the right and connected to the magenta.\n4. **Reconstruct:** The output is created in this way:\n    - The magenta (6) pixels in the input form the corners of a 3x3 grid\n    - The two yellow (4) pixels form a vertical line to the left of the magenta\n    - The top left magenta fills the top row\n\n5. **Output:** Create and present the new, smaller grid (3x3) containing the results of the reconstruction.\n\nEssentially, the program identifies colored regions, and reconstructs them into a different arrangement in order as a smaller output.\n"
