- observation: The output grid is always 3x3.
- observation: The top row of the output grid is always filled with magenta (6).
- observation:  A vertical line of height equal to the number of columns occupied by the magenta colored object in the input is formed by yellow pixels to the left of the output. The height is limited to the output grid size.
- observation: The rightmost column of the output is always magenta.
- observation: The number of yellow pixels in the input doesn't matter, if they exist, the transformation should use them.
- action: Create a 3x3 output grid.
- action: Fill the top row of the output with magenta (color 6).
- action: Fill the rightmost column of the output with magenta.
- action: Determine the width of the magenta object in the input grid.
- action: Create a vertical line of yellow pixels with the height of the magenta input width, to the left, not exceeding height of 2.
