Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify and Extract:** Locate all non-white regions within the input grid. In this case identify the yellow (4) and magenta (6) regions.
2.  **Isolate:** Mentally separate these colored regions from the white background.
3.  **Relative Positioning:** Observe the original relative positions. Yellow is to the right and connected to the magenta.
4. **Reconstruct:** The output is created in this way:
    - The magenta (6) pixels in the input form the corners of a 3x3 grid
    - The two yellow (4) pixels form a vertical line to the left of the magenta
    - The top left magenta fills the top row

5. **Output:** Create and present the new, smaller grid (3x3) containing the results of the reconstruction.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
