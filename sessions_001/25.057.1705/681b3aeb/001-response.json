The input grid contains two distinct colored objects: a green (3) object in the top-left and an orange (7) object in the bottom-right.  The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, retaining only the colored pixels and their relative positions, and getting rid of the white (0) background.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each of these blocks is an object.\n2.  **Extract Colors:** For each identified object, record its color (pixel value).\n3.  **Determine Relative Positions:** Observe the relative spatial positions of the identified objects within the input grid (e.g., top-left, bottom-right).\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions of this grid are determined by the bounding box that would enclose all identified, colored objects.\n5. **Place Colored Pixels:** In the output grid place colored object. Start the colored block on the first row. If there are multiple colored blocks on a row, place a space between them. Do this until all the colors of input grid are exhausted.\n6. **Remove Empty Rows/Cols:** Remove any remaining entirely empty rows and columns from the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the colored objects from the input, removes the background, and arranges them in a smaller grid while preserving their relative positioning.\n"
