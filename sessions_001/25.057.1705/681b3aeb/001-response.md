Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 10x10 grid (input) into a 3x3 grid (output). The input grid contains two distinct colored objects: a green (3) object in the top-left and an orange (7) object in the bottom-right.  The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, retaining only the colored pixels and their relative positions, and getting rid of the white (0) background.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: green_object
    color: green (3)
    initial_position: top-left
    shape: irregular, contiguous block
    size: 3 pixels
  - object: orange_object
    color: orange (7)
    initial_position: bottom-right
    shape: 2x2 square block
    size: 4 pixels
  - input_grid:
    dimensions: 10x10
    background_color: white (0)
  - output_grid:
    dimensions: 3x3
    background_color: none (implicitly)
  - action: condensation
    description: Extract colored objects and reposition them, maintaining relative positions.
  - relation: spatial_relation
    description: The relative positions of colored objects are preserved in the transformation.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-zero (non-white) pixels in the input grid. Each of these blocks is an object.
2.  **Extract Colors:** For each identified object, record its color (pixel value).
3.  **Determine Relative Positions:** Observe the relative spatial positions of the identified objects within the input grid (e.g., top-left, bottom-right).
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions of this grid are determined by the bounding box that would enclose all identified, colored objects.
5. **Place Colored Pixels:** In the output grid place colored object. Start the colored block on the first row. If there are multiple colored blocks on a row, place a space between them. Do this until all the colors of input grid are exhausted.
6. **Remove Empty Rows/Cols:** Remove any remaining entirely empty rows and columns from the output.

In essence, the transformation extracts the colored objects from the input, removes the background, and arranges them in a smaller grid while preserving their relative positioning.
