## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4
0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x777851443CF0>

**output:**
```
6 6 6
4 6 6
4 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x777869E5D450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into a smaller grid, seemingly extracting and rearranging specific colored regions. The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: yellow (4) and magenta (6). The output grid combines these regions in a compact, altered arrangement. The white pixels (0) in the input seem to be ignored, acting as background.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and Extract:** Locate all non-white regions within the input grid. In this case identify the yellow (4) and magenta (6) regions.
2.  **Isolate:** Mentally separate these colored regions from the white background.
3.  **Relative Positioning:** Observe the original relative positions. Yellow is to the right and connected to the magenta.
4. **Reconstruct:** The output is created in this way:
    - The magenta (6) pixels in the input form the corners of a 3x3 grid
    - The two yellow (4) pixels form a vertical line to the left of the magenta
    - The top left magenta fills the top row

5. **Output:** Create and present the new, smaller grid (3x3) containing the results of the reconstruction.

Essentially, the program identifies colored regions, and reconstructs them into a different arrangement in order as a smaller output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
