## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 3 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 5 5 5 5 5
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6 6 6 6 6 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 8 8 8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x640 at 0x7778518FB430>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 3

0 0 6 6 6 6 6
0 5 5 5 5 5 5
8 8 8 8 8 8 8
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves rearranging colored horizontal bars within a grid. The input grid contains several horizontal bars of different colors and lengths, positioned at various locations. The output grid shows these bars rearranged, seemingly sorted by their original vertical position, and shifted to the right side of the grid. Empty spaces (represented by '0' or white) are filled in accordingly. The overall grid dimensions appear to remain constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: object
    description: horizontal bars
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9) representing different colors
      - length: integer, number of contiguous pixels of the same color
      - position: (row, col) coordinates of the leftmost pixel
  - type: action
    description: rearrangement
    properties:
      - sorting: bars are sorted based on their initial row position, maintaining relative order
      - alignment: bars are right-aligned within the grid
  - type: environment
    description: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: constant height and width between input and output
      - background: color 0 (white), fills empty spaces
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all horizontal bars in the input grid. A horizontal bar is defined as a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, excluding color 0 (white).
2.  **Record Properties:** For each bar, record its color, length, and the row index of its leftmost pixel.
3.  **Sort Bars:** Sort the bars based on their recorded row index. Maintain the relative order of bars that start on the same row.
4. **Create New Grid**: Initialize a new grid.
5.  **Place Bars:** Iterate through the sorted bars. For each bar:
    *   Calculate its starting column index for right alignment: `grid_width` - `bar_length`.
    *   Place the bar on the next available row in the output grid, starting from the calculated column index, moving to the rows below.
6.  **Fill Empty Spaces:** Fill all remaining cells in the output grid with color 0 (white).
7.  **Return New Grid:** Return the new grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
