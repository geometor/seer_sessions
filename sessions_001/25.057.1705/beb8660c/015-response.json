            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (rotate everything 90 degrees clockwise except the bottom row) was partially correct. It worked for the first training example, but failed on subsequent examples. This indicates the rule is not universal and needs to be more specific, or perhaps there are actually multiple different rules in operation. The key is to identify common patterns or relationships between the input and output grids across *all* examples, not just the first one. We need to move beyond simple rotation and consider other geometric manipulations, object identification, and potentially conditional operations.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Object Identification:**  Instead of treating the entire grid as a single entity to be rotated, we should identify individual objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) within each grid.\n2. **Property Analysis:** For each object, analyze its properties: color, shape, size, position (both absolute and relative to other objects).\n3. **Transformation Mapping:** For each input-output pair, try to map the transformation of individual objects.  How does each object in the input relate to an object in the output?  Look for consistent changes in position, orientation, size, and color.\n4. **Rule Refinement:** Based on the mapping, develop a more precise natural language program that describes the transformation rules. This might involve multiple rules or conditions.\n5. **Code Execution for Metrics:** Use `code_execution` to calculate exact error values and identify where the initial rotation logic failed.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, along with code execution results where applicable:\n\n* **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    - Input: 3x3, Output: 3x3\n        ```\n        Input:\n        [[5, 5, 5],\n         [5, 5, 5],\n         [8, 8, 1]]\n        Output:\n        [[5, 5, 5],\n         [5, 5, 5],\n         [8, 8, 1]]\n        ```\n\n    - `transform` result: `[[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [8, 8, 1]]`\n    - The initial hypothesis works perfectly here. The top 2x3 gray rectangle is rotated.\n    - Difference with expected output: 0\n\n* **Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n    - Input: 5x5, Output: 5x5\n    ```\n        Input:\n        [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n         [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n         [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n         [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n         [8, 8, 8, 1, 5]]\n        Output:\n        [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n         [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n         [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n         [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n         [8, 8, 8, 1, 5]]\n    ```\n     - `transform` result: `[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8, 1, 5]]`\n    - The output is identical to the input. The rotation rule clearly doesn't apply here.  The bottom row remains unchanged, which is consistent with our initial (incomplete) rule.\n    - Difference with expected output: 0\n* **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n     - Input: 7x7, Output: 7x7\n     ```\n     Input:\n    [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 5]]\n    Output:\n    [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n     [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 5]]\n     ```\n    - `transform` result: `[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 5]]`\n    - Again, the output is identical to the input. The previous rule does *not* apply. The last row remains the same.\n    - Difference with expected output: 0\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [2, 3]\n        position: [0, 0]\n      - object_id: 2\n        color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,2]\n        position: [2,0]\n      - object_id: 3\n         color: blue\n         shape: rectangle\n         size: [1,1]\n         position: [2,2]\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [2, 3]\n        position: [0, 0]\n      - object_id: 2\n        color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,2]\n        position: [2,0]\n      - object_id: 3\n         color: blue\n         shape: rectangle\n         size: [1,1]\n         position: [2,2]\n\n    transformation: |\n       The output is identical to the input.\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [4, 5]\n        position: [0, 0]\n      - object_id: 2\n        color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,3]\n        position: [4,0]\n      - object_id: 3\n         color: blue\n         shape: rectangle\n         size: [1,1]\n         position: [4,3]\n      - object_id: 4\n         color: gray\n         shape: rectangle\n         size: [1,1]\n         position: [4,4]\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [4, 5]\n        position: [0, 0]\n       - object_id: 2\n        color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,3]\n        position: [4,0]\n      - object_id: 3\n         color: blue\n         shape: rectangle\n         size: [1,1]\n         position: [4,3]\n      - object_id: 4\n         color: gray\n         shape: rectangle\n         size: [1,1]\n         position: [4,4]\n    transformation: |\n      The output is identical to the input.\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_objects:\n       - object_id: 1\n        color: gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [6, 7]\n        position: [0, 0]\n       - object_id: 2\n        color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,5]\n        position: [6,0]\n       - object_id: 3\n        color: blue\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,1]\n        position: [6,5]\n       - object_id: 4\n        color: gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,1]\n        position: [6,6]\n    output_objects:\n       - object_id: 1\n        color: gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [6, 7]\n        position: [0, 0]\n       - object_id: 2\n        color: azure\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,5]\n        position: [6,0]\n       - object_id: 3\n        color: blue\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,1]\n        position: [6,5]\n       - object_id: 4\n        color: gray\n        shape: rectangle\n        size: [1,1]\n        position: [6,6]\n    transformation: |\n      The output is identical to the input.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nBased on the analysis of *all* training examples, the transformation rule is:\n\nThe output grid is identical to the input grid.\n\n"
