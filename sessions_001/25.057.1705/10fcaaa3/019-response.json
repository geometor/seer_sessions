The output is a larger 8x8 grid.\n*   The input grid contains a single red (2) pixel; the rest are white (0).\n*   The output grid contains two red (2) pixels at positions that maintain relative location of input red pixel.\n*   The output grid has many azure (8) pixels, in alternating positions\n*   The output contains white (0) pixels\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
