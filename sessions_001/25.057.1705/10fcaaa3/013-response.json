The primary colors involved are white (0), yellow (4), and azure (8). The output grid appears to be an expansion and a patterned replication of the input grid, with the addition of the azure color. The yellow pixels in the input seem to maintain their relative positions within a subsection of the output, while also appearing in a mirrored position. The azure color seems to fill in a checkerboard-like pattern, and also forms a border around blocks of four cells.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The positions in the output grid can be described as `(row * 2 + 1, col * 2 + 1)` where row and col are from the original input indices, and the row and column are 0-indexed. Replicate copied yellow positions by creating mirror along the new row axis.\n\n3. **Fill with Azure background:** Create a checkerboard pattern filling in with 8 by taking each output pixel and checking this condition `(row + col) % 2 == 0`.\n\n4.  **Overlay Border:** For any empty cells, if the cells above, below, left, or right are of the azure color, change this empty cell to azure.\n\n5.  **Fill Remaining:** All the cells that still contain white(0) should be set to be azure(8).\n"
