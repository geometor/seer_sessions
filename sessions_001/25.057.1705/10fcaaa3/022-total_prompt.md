Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expand Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid (from 4x4 to 8x8).

2.  **Replicate Red:** Duplicate input red pixel
    *   first replicated pixel will appear at same row but in column = column * 2
    *   second replicated pixel will appear at row = row * 4, column will stay
        the same

3.  **Populate Azure Checkboard:** Fill alternating cells in the expanded output grid with azure (8), starting at the top-left cell (0,0). Specifically add an azure cell to the output grid if:
    *   the sum of its row and column indices is even.

4. **Fill Remaining with White**: Any output cells not filled with a value are filled with white (0).

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Expand Grid: Double the dimensions of the input grid.
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Find the red pixel in the input grid.
    red_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 2)
    if len(red_pixels) > 0:
        red_row, red_col = red_pixels[0]

        # Replicate Red (first instance).
        output_grid[red_row, red_col * 2] = 2
        # second red pixel
        output_grid[red_row * 4, red_col] = 2


    # Populate Azure Checkerboard.
    for row in range(output_height):
        for col in range(output_width):
            if (row + col) % 2 == 0:
                output_grid[row, col] = 8

    # the fill remaining with white happens by default
    # because of np.zeros initialization

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. While the code correctly handles the first example, it fails on subsequent examples. The primary issue is that the replication of the red pixel and its placement logic is too specific to the first example. It assumes a fixed relationship between input and output red pixel locations. We need a more general rule for red pixel placement. The checkerboard pattern logic seems correct, however.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs to identify the *general* rule governing red pixel placement. Look for patterns or relationships between the input and output positions of the red pixels that hold true across *all* examples.
2.  **Refine Red Pixel Logic:** Update the natural language program and, subsequently, the code, to reflect the generalized red pixel placement rule.
3.  **Maintain Checkerboard Logic:** The azure checkerboard pattern generation seems correct based on the provided examples, so we'll keep that part of the code/description.
4.  **Validate:** After updating the natural language program, I would prepare the information for the Coder, which will execute the revised code and verify against all examples again.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

To precisely describe the red pixel placement, let's get the coordinates for each example.

# Helper function to get red pixel coordinates
def get_red_pixel_coordinates(grid):
    red_pixels = np.argwhere(grid == 2)
    if len(red_pixels) > 0:
        return red_pixels.tolist()  # Return as list of [row, col]
    else:
        return []

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
