observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: input (h, w), output (2h, 2w)
      background: azure checkerboard pattern (alternating azure and black, starting with azure at [0,0])
  - object: yellow_pixels
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      input_positions: varied
      output_positions: |
          Specific positions derived from input positions. 
          If a yellow pixel exists in the input at [r, c],
          then the corresponding output positions include [2r+1, 2c+1]
          and a mirrored pixel at [2r+1, 2(width-1-c)+1]
    actions:
      - replicate: replicate yellow pixels at calculated coordinates
      - mirror: create additional yellow pixels
