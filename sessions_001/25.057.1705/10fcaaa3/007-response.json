Some cells contain the digit '0' (white), while others contain the digit '6' (magenta).\n*   **Output:** A 6x8 grid. It seems to be an expansion of the original grid. It contains '0' (white), '6' (magenta), and a new color '8'(azure). The '6's appear in positions related to the input, but with an added alternating pattern. The '8' forms a kind of checkerboard or fill pattern within the expansion, and solid lines around the perimeter and between sections.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Their placement follows a pattern:\n    *   Each original '6' occupies a 2x2 section of the expanded grid.\n    *   Within the 2x2 sections they have a specific placement relating to the overall checkerboard.\n    *   For each original '6' location in the input:\n        *   It appears in the top-left cell of its 2x2 section.\n        *   It appears in the cell diagonally adjacent (down and right) within its section.\n\n3.  **Checkerboard and solid lines Fill with '8':** The remaining empty cells in the expanded grid, are filled with azure pixels ('8') in an alternating checkerboard pattern *and* form a solid azure line around the perimeter and between sections, as though the 2x2 sections that represent a doubled pixel are highlighted. The '8's are in locations within their 2x2 area.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves expanding the grid, replicating and positioning the original magenta pixels within a larger pattern, and filling the background with a checkerboard and solid line pattern of azure.\n"
