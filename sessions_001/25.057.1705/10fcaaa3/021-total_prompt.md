Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expand Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid (from 4x4 to 8x8).

2.  **Replicate Red:** Duplicate input red pixel
    *   first replicated pixel will appear at same row but in column = column * 2
    *   second replicated pixel will appear at row = row * 4, column will stay
        the same

3.  **Populate Azure Checkboard:** Fill alternating cells in the expanded output grid with azure (8), starting at the top-left cell (0,0). Specifically add an azure cell to the output grid if:
    *   the sum of its row and column indices is even.

4. **Fill Remaining with White**: Any output cells not filled with a value are filled with white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
