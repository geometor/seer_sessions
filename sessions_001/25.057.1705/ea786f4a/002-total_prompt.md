## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x777851601450>

**output:**
```
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x777851601D10>
Okay, here's a report on my perception of the task, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid has a white (0) pixel in the center and blue (1) pixels elsewhere. The output grid alternates white (0) and blue (1) pixels in a checkerboard pattern, with white pixels in the corners and center. The transformation seems to involve changing some of the blue pixels to white based on their position.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0, 1]
        mapping:
          0: white
          1: blue

input:
  - object: grid
    description: Center pixel is white, all others are blue.
    state:
      - [1, 1, 1]
      - [1, 0, 1]
      - [1, 1, 1]

output:
  - object: grid
    description: Checkerboard pattern of white and blue pixels.
    state:
      - [0, 1, 0]
      - [1, 0, 1]
      - [0, 1, 0]

actions:
  - name: change_color
    description: Changes the color of a pixel.
    parameters:
      - pixel_location: (row, column)
      - new_color: int

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
    properties:
      - adjacency:  Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Corners:** Change the color of the pixels at the four corners (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2) to white (0).
3. **Center Already White:** The center pixel is already white, so ensure no unecessary work.
4.  **Edges:** The remaining pixels are already correct.
5. **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

In simpler terms: Change the corner pixels in input to white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
