            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying the largest non-white rectangle and checking if its corners are white (0) in the output is a good starting point. However, the provided examples and the test results show this is not the only transformation and is not entirely accurate. The key observation is that only *some* corners of the identified rectangle become white, specifically, alternating corners starting with the top-left corner.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Corner Identification:** Instead of assuming all corners change, we need to specify that only the top-left and bottom-right corners (or, equivalently, the top-right and bottom-left) are changed to white.\n2.  **Verify the Transformation:** The core logic correctly identifies the largest rectangle, and the results verify this rectangle is used in the output.\n3. **Update Natural Language program** describe the alternating white corners\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from provided code execution):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Grid: 6x6, Rectangle Color: 1 (blue), Area: 16, Corners: `[(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)]`\n    *   Output Corners White: `False`. This is important. Although (1,1) and (4,4) *are* white, the previous code did not correctly interpret.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Grid: 8x8, Rectangle Color: 1 (blue), Area: 12, Corners: `[(2, 2), (2, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5)]`\n    *   Output Corners White: `False`. Similar issue as above.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Grid: 9x9, Rectangle Color: 1 (blue), Area: 15, Corners: `[(2, 2), (2, 6), (5, 2), (5, 6)]`\n    *    Output Corners White: `False`. Similar issue as above\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: rectangle\n    description: The largest contiguous block of a single non-white color.\n    properties:\n      - color: value of the cells (1-9)\n      - corners:\n          type: list of tuples\n          description: (row, column) coordinates of the rectangle's four corners.\n          order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right\n      - area:\n        type: integer\n        description: Number of cells.\n\n  - transformation: corner_modification\n    description: Two corners of the detected rectangle are changed to white.\n    details:\n      - The top-left and bottom-right corners are set to color 0 (white).\n      - other rectangle cells are unchanged\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Rectangle:** Find the largest rectangular region within the input grid that consists of a single, non-white color.\n2.  **Locate Corners:** Determine the coordinates of the four corners of this rectangle: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.\n3.  **Modify Corners:** In the output grid, set the color of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle to white (0).\n4. **Preserve other pixels.** All other cells in the rectangle, and all other pixels of the input grid, keep the same color in the output grid.\n\n"
