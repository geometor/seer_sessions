    {'input': [[0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]], 'output': [[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]},

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided data and the results of the preliminary code execution.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focused on identifying basic grid properties like shape, unique colors, and the locations of white and red pixels. This is a good starting point. The provided dummy data and the printed analysis show that this basic analysis is working correctly. However, the core transformation logic is missing, as the dummy `examples` all produce the same output regardless of subtle differences in the input. The real task will require a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship between input and output grids. My strategy is to start extremely simple and add complexity as needed. The initial hypothesis is clearly too simplistic, and the natural language program needs to describe the actual transformation.

**Metrics and Observations (from provided dummy data):**

The `analysis_results` dictionary provides the following:

*   **Input Grids:** All input grids are 3x3. They all contain red (color 2) and some contain white (color 0). The position of the white pixel varies, but is not relevant in the dummy outputs.
*   **Output Grids:** All output grids are 3x3. They all contain a single red pixel (color 2) at the center (1,1) and the rest are white (0).

```yaml
facts:
  example_count: 4
  input_grid_shape:
    height: 3
    width: 3
  output_grid_shape:
    height: 3
    width: 3
  input_colors:
    - red
    - white
  output_colors:
      - red
      - white
  transformation_type: replace
  input_objects:
    - name: red_block
      color: red
      description: contiguous block of red pixels
  output_objects:
      - name: single_red_pixel
        color: red
        coords: [1,1]

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Examine the input grid.
2.  **Replace:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with white pixels.
3.  **Center:** Place a single red pixel in the center (1, 1) of the output grid.

This natural language program correctly describes the transformation seen in *the provided dummy example data*. It's deliberately very basic, as the data provided doesn't give any hints of more complex behavior. When given the real task data, it is very likely the Natural Language Program and YAML facts will change.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
