While this holds true for the first training example, subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. It appears the expansion doesn't *replace* green pixels, but rather *stops* at green pixels or other colored pixels. The core concept of a cross-shaped expansion from a white pixel is valid, but the interaction with other colors needs refinement.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Verify Observations:** Use code execution to confirm the behavior of the expansion in the presence of different colors. Specifically, check if the expansion stops at any non-white color.\n2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the description to accurately reflect the stopping condition of the expansion.\n3.  **Prepare YAML Facts:** Document the objects (white pixel, cross shape), their properties (color, position), and actions (expansion, stopping).\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo confirm I will create reports using `code_execution` with `numpy` to inspect the training examples.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    description = f\"Grid Size: {rows}x{cols}\\\\n\"\n    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))\n    description += \"Color Counts: \" + str(color_counts) + \"\\\\n\"\n\n    white_pixels = np.where(grid == 0)\n    if len(white_pixels[0]) > 0:\n      for r, c in zip(white_pixels[0], white_pixels[1]):\n          description += f\"White Pixel at: ({r}, {c})\\\\n\"\n    else:\n      description += \"No White Pixels Found\\\\n\"\n\n    return description\n\ndef compare_grids(grid1, grid2):\n    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:\n        return \"Grids have different shapes.\"\n    else:\n        return np.array_equal(grid1, grid2)\n\n# Load the training examples\nexamples = task_data['train']\nreports = []\n\nfor i, ex in enumerate(examples):\n    input_grid = np.array(ex['input'])\n    output_grid = np.array(ex['output'])\n\n    report = f\"Example {i+1}:\\\\n\"\n    report += \"Input Grid:\\\\n\"\n    report += describe_grid(input_grid)\n    report += \"\\\\nOutput Grid:\\\\n\"\n    report += describe_grid(output_grid)\n    report += \"\\\\nComparison:\\\\n\"\n    report += str(compare_grids(output_grid, transform(input_grid)))\n\n    reports.append(report)\n\nprint(\"\\\\n---\\\\n\".join(reports))\n```"
