Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a grid by expanding a single white pixel (0) into a cross shape, replacing green pixels (3) along the horizontal and vertical axes.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_center_pixel(grid):
    # Find the coordinates of the white pixel (value 0).
    rows, cols = np.where(grid == 0)
    if len(rows) > 0:  # Check if a white pixel was found
       return rows[0], cols[0]
    return None  # Or handle the case where no white pixel is present

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Find the center white pixel.
    center = find_center_pixel(input_grid)
    if center is None:
        return output_grid # if no center, do nothing
    center_row, center_col = center

    # Expand vertically.
    for r in range(rows):
        output_grid[r, center_col] = 0

    # Expand horizontally.
    for c in range(cols):
        output_grid[center_row, c] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the observation that a single white pixel expands into a cross shape, replacing green pixels. While this holds true for the first training example, subsequent examples reveal a more nuanced rule. It appears the expansion doesn't *replace* green pixels, but rather *stops* at green pixels or other colored pixels. The core concept of a cross-shaped expansion from a white pixel is valid, but the interaction with other colors needs refinement.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Verify Observations:** Use code execution to confirm the behavior of the expansion in the presence of different colors. Specifically, check if the expansion stops at any non-white color.
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the description to accurately reflect the stopping condition of the expansion.
3.  **Prepare YAML Facts:** Document the objects (white pixel, cross shape), their properties (color, position), and actions (expansion, stopping).

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To confirm I will create reports using `code_execution` with `numpy` to inspect the training examples.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    description = f"Grid Size: {rows}x{cols}\\n"
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    description += "Color Counts: " + str(color_counts) + "\\n"

    white_pixels = np.where(grid == 0)
    if len(white_pixels[0]) > 0:
      for r, c in zip(white_pixels[0], white_pixels[1]):
          description += f"White Pixel at: ({r}, {c})\\n"
    else:
      description += "No White Pixels Found\\n"

    return description

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Grids have different shapes."
    else:
        return np.array_equal(grid1, grid2)

# Load the training examples
examples = task_data['train']
reports = []

for i, ex in enumerate(examples):
    input_grid = np.array(ex['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(ex['output'])

    report = f"Example {i+1}:\\n"
    report += "Input Grid:\\n"
    report += describe_grid(input_grid)
    report += "\\nOutput Grid:\\n"
    report += describe_grid(output_grid)
    report += "\\nComparison:\\n"
    report += str(compare_grids(output_grid, transform(input_grid)))

    reports.append(report)

print("\\n---\\n".join(reports))
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
