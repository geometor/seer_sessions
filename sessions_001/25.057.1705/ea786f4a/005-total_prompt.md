Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of identifying the largest non-white rectangle and checking if its corners are white (0) in the output is a good starting point. However, the provided examples and the test results show this is not the only transformation and is not entirely accurate. The key observation is that only *some* corners of the identified rectangle become white, specifically, alternating corners starting with the top-left corner.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Corner Identification:** Instead of assuming all corners change, we need to specify that only the top-left and bottom-right corners (or, equivalently, the top-right and bottom-left) are changed to white.
2.  **Verify the Transformation:** The core logic correctly identifies the largest rectangle, and the results verify this rectangle is used in the output.
3. **Update Natural Language program** describe the alternating white corners

**Metrics and Observations (from provided code execution):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Grid: 6x6, Rectangle Color: 1 (blue), Area: 16, Corners: `[(1, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 4)]`
    *   Output Corners White: `False`. This is important. Although (1,1) and (4,4) *are* white, the previous code did not correctly interpret.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Grid: 8x8, Rectangle Color: 1 (blue), Area: 12, Corners: `[(2, 2), (2, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5)]`
    *   Output Corners White: `False`. Similar issue as above.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Grid: 9x9, Rectangle Color: 1 (blue), Area: 15, Corners: `[(2, 2), (2, 6), (5, 2), (5, 6)]`
    *    Output Corners White: `False`. Similar issue as above

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: rectangle
    description: The largest contiguous block of a single non-white color.
    properties:
      - color: value of the cells (1-9)
      - corners:
          type: list of tuples
          description: (row, column) coordinates of the rectangle's four corners.
          order: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
      - area:
        type: integer
        description: Number of cells.

  - transformation: corner_modification
    description: Two corners of the detected rectangle are changed to white.
    details:
      - The top-left and bottom-right corners are set to color 0 (white).
      - other rectangle cells are unchanged

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Rectangle:** Find the largest rectangular region within the input grid that consists of a single, non-white color.
2.  **Locate Corners:** Determine the coordinates of the four corners of this rectangle: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
3.  **Modify Corners:** In the output grid, set the color of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle to white (0).
4. **Preserve other pixels.** All other cells in the rectangle, and all other pixels of the input grid, keep the same color in the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
