The grids contain numerical values that can represent colors. The primary colors involved are '2' (red) and '0' (white). The input grid has a single white pixel ('0') at the center, surrounded by red pixels ('2'). The output grid has more white pixels, arranged in a cross or plus-sign (+) shape centered on the original white pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The '0' replaces any '2' that is in the same row or column as any existing `0`.\n"
