The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary change seems to be the replication of certain colored pixels (represented by non-zero numbers) in a specific pattern. Specifically, the red (2) and azure (8) pixels are duplicated, creating a vertical line below each original instance of these colored pixel. The white pixels (0) are unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
