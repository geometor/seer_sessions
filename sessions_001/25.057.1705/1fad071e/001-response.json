The input grid contains various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on specific colors and their counts. The spatial arrangement in the output doesn't appear to directly correspond to the input's arrangement. Instead it seems the output represents a summary of a particular part of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
