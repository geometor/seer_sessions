## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2
1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7778518FB250>

**output:**
```
1 1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x7778518FB070>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on specific colors and their counts. The spatial arrangement in the output doesn't appear to directly correspond to the input's arrangement. Instead it seems the output represents a summary of a particular part of the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red
      - objects:
        - color: 1 # blue
          instances: 5
          positions: [(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (8,1), (8,8), (5,5), (6,5)]
        - color: 2 # red
          instances: 4
          positions:  [(0,4), (0,5), (2,7), (2,8), (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3)]
        - color: 0 # white
          instances:  68 #the rest
          positions: # the rest

  - type: grid
    description: Output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 1x5
      - colors: [1, 0] # blue, white
      - objects:
        - color: 1 #blue
          count: 2
        - color: 0 # white
          count: 3
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Objects:** In the input grid, locate all instances of the blue pixels (color code 1).
2.  **Count Specific Occurrences:** Count the number of times a blue object (contiguous block of blue pixels) appears which have at least another blue pixel diagonally adjacent to the upper left.
3. **Construct the output:** Create an array with length equal to the number of distinct colored blocks present in the input plus two. Store the occurrences.

Here is an improved version of the natural language program

1. **Identify Objects**: Count the number of contiguous blue (color 1) blocks along the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right.
2. **Construct Output**: Create 1x5 output. Insert the count from Step 1 as the first element, followed by white (color 0) pixels to fill the remaining spaces.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
