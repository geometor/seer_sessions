Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: turning white pixels yellow if they are adjacent to red pixels. However, the initial program was too broad, encompassing *all* adjacent white pixels (horizontally and vertically). The additional examples reveal a crucial constraint: only the white pixels to the *right* of the red pixels are changed to yellow. The provided code already contains this constraint because it iterates through the grid starting on the left.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

The primary error is conceptual: the code is almost correct but the logic is slightly off. It changes adjacent white pixels in all direct (not diagonal) directions rather than in the single required direction (right). The updated natural language program will focus on clarifying this critical distinction to get the logic of the solution.

**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis):**

To be absolutely certain about the nature of each of the training set, I will construct a small reporting utility to give clear insight into the data.

```python
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    """Provides a descriptive summary of the grid."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    description = {
        "dimensions": f"{rows}x{cols}",
        "colors": color_counts
    }
    return description

def analyze_examples(examples):
   report = ""
   for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        transformed_grid = transform(input_grid)  # use the provided transform
        correct = np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid)
        
        report += f"Example {i+1}:\n"
        report += f"  Input: {describe_grid(input_grid)}\n"
        report += f"  Output: {describe_grid(output_grid)}\n"
        report += f"  Transformed: {describe_grid(transformed_grid)}\n"
        report += f"  Correct: {correct}\n"
        report += "\n"
   return report
