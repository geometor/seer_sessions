    relations:
      - input_to_output: transformation

  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      - location: row and column index within the grid

  - action: modification
    description: changing pixel color from 0 to 4
    conditions:
      - spatial_relation: proximity to pixels of color 2

  - observation:
