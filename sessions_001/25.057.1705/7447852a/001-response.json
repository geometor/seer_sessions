The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary change seems to involve the introduction of the number '4' (yellow) in specific locations relative to the number '2' (red).  There's a spatial relationship between the '2's and the introduced '4's. It seems we're modifying or adding to the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If this happens, fill with yellow (value 4).\n\n4.  **Fill:** Transform each located '0' adjacent to a `2` pixel into a '4' (yellow).\n\n5.  **Preserve**: All other pixel locations in the input keep their value in the output.\n\n6.  **Output**: The result is the modified grid.\n"
