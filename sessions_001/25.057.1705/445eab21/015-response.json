            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the assumption that the transformation involves identifying the largest yellow \"C\" shape and extracting a 2x2 square from its top-left corner. While this worked for the first example, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in this assumption. The transformation appears to consistently extract a 2x2 square, but the selection of *which* 2x2 square is more nuanced than initially thought. It isn't always tied to the largest yellow object, or even a yellow object at all. We need to re-evaluate the selection criteria for the 2x2 square. The strategy should involve:\n\n1.  **Identifying Consistent Features:** Examine all input-output pairs to identify consistent features of the extracted 2x2 squares. This might include their color composition, relative position within a larger shape, or relationship to other objects.\n\n2.  **Refining the Selection Logic:** Based on the consistent features, redefine the selection logic. This may involve finding specific shapes or color patterns, rather than simply taking the top-left of the largest yellow object.\n\n3.  **Considering Alternatives:** If the color isn't the primary determinant, explore other object properties like shape, relative position, or relationships between different colored objects.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo gather precise metrics, I'll describe what needs to be checked for each example and then how a report could summarize this.\n\n*   **Input Grid Properties:** Size, colors present, number of distinct objects of each color.\n*   **Output Grid Properties:** Colors present in the 2x2 output.\n*   **Relationship:**\n    *   Is the 2x2 square present *exactly* in the input?\n    *   If so, what are the coordinates of the top-left corner of the 2x2 square in the input grid?\n    *   Describe the immediate surroundings (adjacent pixels) of the extracted 2x2 square within the input grid. Are there any consistent patterns in the surrounding pixels?\n\n**Example Analysis Table**\n\n| Example | Input Size | Input Colors | Output Colors | 2x2 in Input? | Top-Left Coords (if present) | Surrounding Pattern |\n| :------ | :--------- | :----------- | :------------ | :------------ | :--------------------------- | :------------------ |\n| 1       | 11x11      | 0, 4        | 4             | Yes           | (1, 1)                       | Yellow \"C\" shape    |\n| 2       | 11x11      | 0, 4, 1     | 4, 1     | Yes           | (5, 3)     | Yellow \"C\", blue at bottom right      |\n| 3       | 10x11      | 0, 4, 1, 5    | 4, 1            | Yes           |   (4,1)                        |   Yellow \"C\", blue at bottom right, grey at left                  |\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      yellow_c:\n        color: 4\n        shape: C-like\n        top_left: (1, 1)\n    extracted_square:\n        top_left: (1,1)\n        size: (2, 2)\n        colors: [4, 4, 4, 4]\n\nexample_2:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      yellow_c:\n        color: 4\n        shape: C-like\n      blue_region:\n          color: 1\n          relation_to_c: bottom_right\n    extracted_square:\n      top_left: (5,3)\n      size: (2, 2)\n      colors: [4, 4, 4, 1]\n\nexample_3:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      yellow_c:\n          color: 4\n          shape: C-like\n      blue_region:\n          color: 1\n          relation_to_c: bottom_right\n      grey_region:\n          color: 5\n          relation_to_c: left\n    extracted_square:\n      top_left: (4,1)\n      size: (2, 2)\n      colors: [4, 4, 4, 1]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Locate the \"C\" shape:** Find the object in the input grid that most closely resembles the letter \"C\". This \"C\" is always made of yellow pixels (color 4).\n\n2.  **Examine the surroundings:** Analyze the region immediately surrounding the identified \"C\" shape. Look for consistent patterns involving other colors.\n\n3. **Identify the presence of blue**: Find all instances of 2x2 regions with the bottom-right element of the square a blue pixel.\n\n4.  **Extract 2x2 Square:** Extract the 2x2 square of pixels at this identified region. This is the output.\n\nThe key update here is the focus on finding the \"C\" shape, analyzing its surroundings (specifically the presence of the blue in the bottom-right), and then extracting the 2x2 region from the top-left of the location. This refined program takes into account the consistent presence of a particular arrangement of colors.\n"
