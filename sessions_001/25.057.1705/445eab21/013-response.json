The input grid contains two distinct shapes formed by colored pixels. One shape is a larger \"C\" made of yellow (4) pixels, and the other is a smaller square made of red (2) pixels. The output grid contains only a small 2x2 square of yellow (4) pixels. The background of both grids is white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A shape is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Select Target Shape:** Identify the object made by the yellow (value 4) pixels. Other shape(s) are ignored.\n3.  **Extract Sub-shape:** From the upper-leftmost corner of the yellow \"C\" object in the original, extract a 2x2 square sub-shape from the targeted shape.\n4. **Return sub-shape**: return the extracted sub-shape as a new grid, keeping the original colors and values.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves identifying the largest yellow shape, and extracting a 2x2 square of pixels starting from the top-left part of the yellow \"c\" shape. The red shape is completely ignored.\n"
