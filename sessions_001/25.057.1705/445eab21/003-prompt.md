Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects within the input grid based on contiguous regions of the same color. Ignore the white background (0) and any objects not azure.
2.  **Focus on Azure:** Select the azure (8) colored object.
3.  **Find Corners:** Locate the smallest rectangle which can bound all the pixels that belong to an object colored azure.
4. **Construct Subgrid:** A new subgrid from this information. The topleft pixel of the azure object will be the origin of the new grid, the size of the subgrid will equal the width and height of the bounding box
5.  **Output:** Return new grid as output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
