## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x320 at 0x7778516D14F0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a blue pixel (1) and a red pixel (2) on the second row, with all other pixels being white (0). The output grid maintains the same structure, but the blue and red pixels have expanded. A gray pixel (5) appears between the expanded blue and red regions.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains two distinct objects: a blue pixel (object 1) and a red pixel (object 2).
  - object_1:
      color: blue (1)
      initial_position: [1, 0]  # (row, col)
      shape: single pixel
  - object_2:
      color: red (2)
      initial_position: [1, 10] # (row, col)
      shape: single pixel
  - context: |
      The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
  - transformation: |
      Both the blue and red objects expand horizontally.
      The blue object expands to the right.
      The red object expands to the left.
       A gray pixel is inserted in between the expanded regions of object blue and red.
  - object_3:
      color: gray(5)
      position: [1,5]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the blue (1) and red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Blue Expansion:** Replicate the blue pixel to the right until the midpoint between to original blue and red is reached (exclusive).
3. **Red Expansion:** Replicate the red pixel to the left until the midpoint between the original blue and red is reached (exclusive).
4. **Gray Insertion:** Insert a single gray (5) pixel at the midpoint between the original blue and red coordinates along the horizontal axis.
5. **Preserve Whitespace:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged (white/0).

Essentially we find the two colored pixels and expand the blue to the right, and
the red to the left, inserting gray in the middle.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
