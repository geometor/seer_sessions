      The input grid contains two distinct objects: a blue pixel (object 1) and a red pixel (object 2).
  - object_1:
      color: blue (1)
      initial_position: [1, 0]  # (row, col)
      shape: single pixel
  - object_2:
      color: red (2)
      initial_position: [1, 10] # (row, col)
      shape: single pixel
  - context: |
      The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels (0).
  - transformation: |
      Both the blue and red objects expand horizontally.
      The blue object expands to the right.
      The red object expands to the left.
       A gray pixel is inserted in between the expanded regions of object blue and red.
  - object_3:
