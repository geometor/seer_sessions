# Example

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x77B18244F8E0>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x77B18244FE80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers into another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, representing blue, red, and green colors respectively. The output grid contains the numbers 4, 5, and 6, representing yellow, gray, and magenta colors respectively. The spatial arrangement of the grid elements remains constant; only the values (and thus colors) change. The transformation seems to be a simple addition to each number in input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          value: integer (0-9)
          color: derived from value (COLOR_MAP)
          position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: transform
    input: grid
    output: grid
    operation: element-wise addition

relationships:
  - type: element-wise
    description: Each cell in the input grid corresponds to the same position cell in the output grid.
  - type: value_mapping
    description:  Input cell value + constant = output cell value.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program takes a 3x3 input grid of integers and transforms it into a 3x3 output grid of integers. For each cell in the input grid, add a constant value of 1 to obtain new value. The spatial configuration is not changed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
