facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are always 3x3.
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: Integers (0-9) representing colors
  - transformation_type: Element-wise arithmetic
  - operation: |
      Each input cell value is transformed by adding a constant and taking the modulo with another.
  - initial_hypothesis: Add 4, modulo 6 (Incorrect)
  - revised_hypothesis: Add 4, modulo 10 (needs code verification)
  - input_output_mapping: |
    The spatial location of a cell in the input directly corresponds to the spatial location of its transformed value in the output grid
  - color_palette_assessment: |
     The initial assumption about color use is likely incorrect based on
     the failed pixel matches
