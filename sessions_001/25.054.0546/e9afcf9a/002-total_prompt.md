## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x737FBE589FC0>

**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x737FBE58A2C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2x6 grid of colored pixels into another 2x6 grid. The input grid consists of two horizontal rows: the top row is entirely green (3), and the bottom row is entirely maroon (9). The output grid retains the same dimensions but alters the arrangement of colors. The colors alternate between green and maroon in both rows and columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [2, 6]
    input_colors:
      row_1: [green, green, green, green, green, green]
      row_2: [maroon, maroon, maroon, maroon, maroon, maroon]
    output_colors:
      row_1: [green, maroon, green, maroon, green, maroon]
      row_2: [maroon, green, maroon, green, maroon, green]
    color_mapping:
      green: 3
      maroon: 9
    transformation_type: alternating_pattern
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation takes a 2x6 grid as input. The output grid is also 2x6. The colors in the output grid alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in both rows and columns. Specifically:

1.  The first row of the output alternates starting with green: green, maroon, green, maroon, green, maroon.
2.  The second row of the output alternates starting with maroon: maroon, green, maroon, green, maroon, green.
3. Each column alternates between green and maroon.

Essentially. The transformation creates a checkerboard pattern using the two colors from the input rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
