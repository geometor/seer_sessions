## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEF4ACE0>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEF4B700>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer in the input grid corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the color map). The output grid is also a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers with corresponding colors. The transformation seems to involve adding 1 to each integer in the input grid to produce the output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_values:
      - [3, 1, 2]
      - [3, 1, 2]
      - [3, 1, 2]
    output_values:
      - [4, 5, 6]
      - [4, 5, 6]
      - [4, 5, 6]
    transformation:
      type: addition
      operand: 1
    element_properties:
      - type: integer
      - range: 0-9
  - input_colors:
      - green
      - blue
      - red
  - output_colors:
      - yellow
      - gray
      - magenta
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The program takes a 3x3 grid of integers as input. Each integer in the input grid is incremented by 1. The resulting integers form the output 3x3 grid. The color mapping between input and output grid shows: input green becomes output yellow, input blue becomes output gray, and input red becomes output magenta. Each input value is increased by one to create each output value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
