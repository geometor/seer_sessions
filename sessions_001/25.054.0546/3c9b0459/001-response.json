Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input and output grids appear to have the same dimensions and a similar distribution of colors, but their positions are rearranged. The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection of the grid elements.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
