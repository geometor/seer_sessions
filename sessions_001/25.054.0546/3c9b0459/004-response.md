"""
The input grid is transformed into the output grid by reversing the order of its rows.

1.  **Identify:** The input is a grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Reverse Rows:** Reverse the order of the rows in the grid. The top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on. The columns stay in their original order.
3.  **Produce:** The resulting grid with reversed rows is the output.
