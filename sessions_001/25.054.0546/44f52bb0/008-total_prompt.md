## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEF4AF80>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x737FBEF4B730>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors. The output is a single numerical value. It appears the transformation involves identifying a specific color in the input grid and associating it with another color based on a rule derived from the positions of the colors and assigning a specific color to the output..

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (representing colors)
  - output:
      type: scalar
      datatype: integer
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: grid
        description: Contains color values.
      - name: identified_color_pixels
        type: pixels
        properties:
          color: 2 (red)
  - actions:
        - count number of red cells

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate all pixels in the input grid with the value 2 (red).
2.  **Count**: Count the number of these red pixels.
3. **Assign**: If the count of red pixels in the Input grid equals 3, the output will be assigned to the color 7 (orange).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
