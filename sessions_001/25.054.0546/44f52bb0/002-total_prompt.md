## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE588940>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x737FBE588FD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The output is a 1x1 grid containing a single blue pixel (represented by the number 1). The transformation seems to involve counting or identifying a specific feature within the input grid and representing it with a blue pixel in the output. The specific feature is likely the number of red pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3] # Initial dimensions
      elements: [0, 2] # white and red
      type: input

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 2
      label: red

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 0
      label: white
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [1,1]
      elements: [ 1 ]
      type: output
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 1
      label: blue

actions:
  - type: count
    target: "pixels with color 2 (red)"
    result: "number of red pixels"

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: "The input grid is transformed into a single blue pixel representing the number of red squares."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.
2.  **Output:** Create a 1x1 output grid. The single pixel in the output is assigned to blue(value of '1'). This represents that we counted something.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
