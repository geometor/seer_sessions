## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFC10>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFB80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation appears to be a rotation or reflection of the grid, rather than a change in the values themselves. The spatial arrangement of the pixels is the primary focus, not their individual values (except as identifiers of distinct objects).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - spatial arrangement
      - color distribution

transformations:
  - type: spatial rearrangement
    description:  The grid appears to be rotated or reflected.

relationships:
  - elements within the grid maintain their values, but their positions change.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation is a 180-degree rotation of the input grid.  Specifically, each element's position (row, col) in the input grid is mapped to (2-row, 2-col) in the output grid. Alternatively, you swap the first and last line and flip the original middle line..


```
input:
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0

flipped 180:

5 0 0
3 7 0
3 3 8

Rotated 180
first row -> last row
last row-> first row
flip middle row:

output:
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
