    details: |
        The permutation can be described as a series of coordinate mappings.
        Examining all examples, we can establish this comprehensive mapping that is consistent across all examples:
          (0, 0) -> (0, 0)
          (0, 1) -> (1, 0)
          (0, 2) -> (2, 0)
          (1, 0) -> (0, 1)
          (1, 1) -> (1, 1)
          (1, 2) -> (2, 1)
          (2, 0) -> (0, 2)
          (2, 1) -> (1, 2)
          (2, 2) -> (2, 2)
