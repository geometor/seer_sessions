objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (representing colors)
      structure: 2D array

actions:
  - name: rotate
    type: spatial transformation
    direction: clockwise
    degrees: 90
    notes: Consistent discrepancies observed between expected and actual rotated outputs. The current implementation seems to be performing an incorrect rotation that is not a true 90 degree clockwise rotation. It seems likely that it rotates the image counter-clockwise instead.
