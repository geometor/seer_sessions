facts:
  - observation: Input grids contain gray (5) and black (0) pixels.
  - observation: Output grids have the same shape as input grids.
  - observation: Output grids contain only colors, and never black.
  - observation: Output colors change depending upon x,y location of gray.
  - observation: Output colors are consistent when gray is in the same column.
  - rule: |
      If gray pixels in input have different x and y, then
        gray(x,y) => green(x,y) if y = x + 1
        gray(x,y) => yellow(x,y) if x == y
        gray(x,y) => red(x,y) if y = x-1 OR y = x - 2
      if gray pixels in input are in the same column, then always map to green.
