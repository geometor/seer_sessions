observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      shape: 3x3
      values: [0, 5]  # 0: white, 5: gray
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      shape: 3x3
      values: [2, 3, 4]  # 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow
  - object: gray_pixel

      positions: varies_per_example
  - relationship: gray_pixel_to_output_value
    description: The value in the output grid at the location of a gray pixel in the input grid varies.
    details:
        - example_1:  gray at [0,2],[1,1],[2,0] results in output values [3,4,2]
        - example_2:  gray at [0,2],[1,2],[2,2] results in output values [3,3,3]
        - example_3:  gray at [0,0],[1,1],[2,0] results in output values [2,4,2]
        - example_4:  gray at [0,1],[1,2],[2,1] results in output values [4,3,4]
  - pattern: row_replacement
    description: The output grid is constructed row by row based on the position of gray pixels.
    mapping: |
      If gray is in the first column, that output row is all 2.
      If gray is in the second column, that output row is all 4.
      If gray is in the third column, that output row is all 3.
