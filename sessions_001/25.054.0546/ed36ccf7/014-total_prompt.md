## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 9
0 0 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE5FD510>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
0 0 9
0 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBC73D690>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a single integer value, representing a color (0 for white and 9 for maroon, based on the provided color map). The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            9: maroon

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: counter-clockwise # preliminary hypothesis
    degrees: 90 # preliminary hypothesis

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: pixels maintain relative positions within the grid, but the entire grid's orientation changes.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid.  Pixels maintain their values, but their positions change according to the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
