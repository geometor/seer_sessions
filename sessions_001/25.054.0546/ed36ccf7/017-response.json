            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise\") was partially correct but incomplete. It captured the rotation aspect but failed to accurately describe the movement of the lower-left pixel. The test results reveal inconsistencies, particularly in examples 2, 3, and 4, where the transformed outputs don't match the expected outputs. The lower left pixel needs special handling, but simply swapping it to the new lower right is not correct. It is *only* a rotation. My added commentary about moving a pixel was an error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Eliminate extra actions**: Remove all attempts to handle the lower-left pixel.\n2.  **Focus on Core Transformation:** Refine the natural language program to explicitly state only the rotation, removing any other transformations.\n3.  **Re-verify:** After updating the natural language program and, subsequently, the code, re-run the validation against all training examples to ensure consistency.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting the discrepancies and validating the core concept of a simple rotation:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with maroon and white pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Correctly rotated.\n    *   Transformed Output: Correctly rotated.\n    *   Initial assessment considered this a swap, rotation is enough.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with gray and white.\n    *   Expected Output: Correctly rotated.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect. One pixel is in the wrong place, evidence of erroneous swap.\n    *   Rotation only will be correct.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with maroon and white.\n    *   Expected Output: Correctly rotated.\n    *   Transformed Output: Incorrect. Two pixels incorrect due to swap logic.\n    *   Rotation only will be correct.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Input: 3x3 grid with red and white.\n    *   Expected Output: Correctly rotated.\n    *    Transformed Output: Incorrect. Three pixels off.\n    *    Rotation only will be correct.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - description: Input grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      - dimensions: Variable (rows x columns)\n\n  - description: Output grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - values: Integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      - dimensions: Variable, derived from input grid dimensions after rotation (columns x rows)\n\nactions:\n  - name: RotateCounterClockwise\n    description: Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    input: Input grid\n    output: Output grid\n    details: >\n      The rotation changes the dimensions of the grid.
