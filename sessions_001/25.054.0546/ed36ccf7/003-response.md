Okay, let's analyze the results of the rotation attempts and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis of a 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. While the output grid sizes are correct, the pixel arrangements are wrong in all tested cases, meaning there is a consistent misunderstanding. The strategy will be as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Go through each example, comparing input, expected output, and the (incorrect) transformed output. Note precisely *which* pixels moved, and *how* they appear to have moved.
2.  **Object Identification**: Identify any discernible objects (contiguous blocks of color) and track how they change. If simple objects aren't apparent, consider the whole grid as a single, complex object.
3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, formulate a new hypothesis about the transformation. It's likely some form of reflection or a combination of simple operations, not just rotation.
4.  **Natural Language Program Update**: Clearly describe this new hypothesis in a revised natural language program.
5.  Repeat the cycle (code, test, observation) based on the new NL program.

**Metrics and Observations (via manual analysis for now)**

| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Match | Pixels Off | Observations                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 3x3        | 3x3         | False | 4          | Top-left 2x2 '9' block becomes bottom-right. Top row '9 0 0' becomes rightmost column, but inverted. |
| 2       | 3x3        | 3x3         | False | 2        | Appears to be some mirroring and changes of position.         |
| 3       | 3x3        | 3x3         | False | 6          | Bottom row becomes top row, top-right column becomes left.                             |
| 4       | 3x3        | 3x3         | False | 6          | Top becomes bottom, bottom becomes top, but colors change positions within.                                       |

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule appears to involve a combination of reflections. It seems like a combination of reflections, potentially across both the vertical and horizontal axes, or a reflection across the main diagonal. The exact order and nature need further investigation, but the core idea is reflection, *not* rotation.

1. **Reflect:** Reflect the input grid across its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). This swaps rows and columns, but in a mirrored fashion.
2. **(Possible) Additional Reflection:** Depending on further examples, there might be an additional reflection across either the vertical or horizontal axis *after* the diagonal reflection.

The primary operation is a reflection over the main diagonal.
