"""
The output grid is a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid.
Additionally, if a pixel in the rotated grid would have a value of 0, and the
pixel in the *original* grid at that location (pre-rotation) had a non-zero value,
then that pixel value is carried over to the rotated/output grid.  This is a
form of conditional overwrite based on comparing the "would-be" rotated value

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and subsequently the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were on the right track (rotation and conditional overwrite), but the implementation of the conditional overwrite was incorrect. The code incorrectly used a "pre-rotated" version of the input grid. The key error is in determining *which* zero values to replace and what values to replace.  Instead of transferring from the input's location in the rotated grid, it should be based on where the original non-zero pixel *would be* after a simple rotation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Clarify Conditional Overwrite Logic:** The core issue is the conditional overwrite. We need to clearly define *when* a zero in the rotated grid should be replaced and by *what* value.
2.  **Correct "pre-rotated" concept:**  The idea of checking the original input grid is good, but indexing into the input grid using output coordinates is flawed. The pre-rotated grid is not a helpful construct. We just need regular rotation, and a way to map from output pixel coordinates to the coordinates where that pixel came from in the input.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to precisely describe the corrected logic.
4.  **Test and Iterate:** After updating the code, rigorously test against all provided examples.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

We'll use a consistent format:

*   **Example X:**
    *   Input, Expected Output, Transformed Output (already provided)
    *   `match`: (already provided)
    *   `pixels_off`: (already provided)
    *   `size_correct`: (already provided)
    *   `color_palette_correct`: (already provided)
    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: (already provided)
    *    *Detailed Pixel Comparison*: A list of (row, col, expected_val, actual_val) for each mismatched pixel.

Here is a summary of the training data, repeating the given metrics and add
`Detailed Pixel Comparison`.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(expected_grid, actual_grid):
    """
    Compares two grids and returns a list of mismatched pixel details.
    """
    mismatches = []
    expected_np = np.array(expected_grid)
    actual_np = np.array(actual_grid)

    rows, cols = expected_np.shape
    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            if expected_np[row, col] != actual_np[row, col]:
                mismatches.append((row, col, int(expected_np[row, col]), int(actual_np[row, col])))

    description: >
      If a pixel in intermediate_grid is 0,
      and the corresponding pixel in the input_grid (before rotation) is not 0,
      overwrite the 0 in intermediate_grid with the non-zero value from the input_grid.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This becomes a temporary grid.
2.  **Conditional Overwrite:** Iterate through each pixel of the *temporary* grid.
    *   If the pixel's value is 0, check the corresponding pixel in the *original* input grid. The corresponding pixel is the one that *would* have been rotated to the current position. The easiest way to compute this correspondence to to apply the inverse transformation (90-degree clockwise rotation) to the coordinates of the current pixel location in the rotated output.
    *   If the corresponding pixel in the original input grid is *not* 0, overwrite the 0 in the temporary grid with the value from the original input grid.
3.  **Output:** The modified temporary grid is the final output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
