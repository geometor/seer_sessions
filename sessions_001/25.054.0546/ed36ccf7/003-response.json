            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the rotation attempts and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis of a 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. While the output grid sizes are correct, the pixel arrangements are wrong in all tested cases, meaning there is a consistent misunderstanding. The strategy will be as follows:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Go through each example, comparing input, expected output, and the (incorrect) transformed output. Note precisely *which* pixels moved, and *how* they appear to have moved.\n2.  **Object Identification**: Identify any discernible objects (contiguous blocks of color) and track how they change. If simple objects aren't apparent, consider the whole grid as a single, complex object.\n3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, formulate a new hypothesis about the transformation. It's likely some form of reflection or a combination of simple operations, not just rotation.\n4.  **Natural Language Program Update**: Clearly describe this new hypothesis in a revised natural language program.\n5.  Repeat the cycle (code, test, observation) based on the new NL program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via manual analysis for now)**\n\n| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Match | Pixels Off | Observations                                                                                                       |\n| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 3x3        | 3x3         | False | 4          | Top-left 2x2 '9' block becomes bottom-right. Top row '9 0 0' becomes rightmost column, but inverted. |\n| 2       | 3x3        | 3x3         | False | 2        | Appears to be some mirroring and changes of position.         |\n| 3       | 3x3        | 3x3         | False | 6          | Bottom row becomes top row, top-right column becomes left.                             |\n| 4       | 3x3        | 3x3         | False | 6          | Top becomes bottom, bottom becomes top, but colors change positions within.                                       |\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: 9\n        shape: L-shape\n        initial_position: top-left\n      - object_id: 2\n          color: 0\n          shape: two pixels\n          initial_position: Top-row, next to object 1\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: 9\n        shape: L-shape\n        final_position: bottom-right, rotated\n    transformations:\n      - type: rotation\n        degrees: -90\n        notes: Inverted/mirrored appearance after the rotation.\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: 6\n        shape: row\n        initial_position: top\n      - object_id: 2\n        color: 0\n        shape: row\n        initial_position: middle\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: 6\n        shape: column\n        final_position: left-side\n    transformations:\n      - type: reflection\n        axis: vertical and position shifts\n        notes: Complex changes that seem to mirror across a vertical and horizontal plane with some value changes.\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_objects:\n       - object_id: 1\n         color: 9\n         shape: L-Shape\n         initial_position: bottom right\n    output_objects:\n       - object_id: 1\n         color: 9\n         shape: L-Shape\n         final_position: top-left\n    transformations:\n       - type: swap\n         axis: Vertical and Horizontal\n         notes: Inverted position after the rotation.\n  - example_id: 4\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: 2\n        shape: Pattern\n        initial_position: All over the grid\n      - object_id: 2\n        color: 0\n        shape: Pattern\n        initial_position: All over the grid\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: 1\n        color: 2\n        shape: Pattern\n        final_position: All over the grid\n      - object_id: 2\n        color: 0\n        shape: Pattern\n        final_position: All over the grid\n    transformations:\n      - type: reflection\n        axis: diagonal\n        notes: Appears to be a reflection along a diagonal line.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule appears to involve a combination of reflections. It seems like a combination of reflections, potentially across both the vertical and horizontal axes, or a reflection across the main diagonal. The exact order and nature need further investigation, but the core idea is reflection, *not* rotation.\n\n1. **Reflect:** Reflect the input grid across its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). This swaps rows and columns, but in a mirrored fashion.\n2. **(Possible) Additional Reflection:** Depending on further examples, there might be an additional reflection across either the vertical or horizontal axis *after* the diagonal reflection.\n\nThe primary operation is a reflection over the main diagonal.\n"
