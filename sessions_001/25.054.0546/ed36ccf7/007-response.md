Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid containing pixels of two colors: white (0) and magenta (6).
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input, also with white (0) and magenta (6) pixels.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve a change in the positions of the magenta and white pixels. It seems like a rotation, reflection or a patterned swap.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    possible_values: [0, 6]

  - id: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: {0: white, 6: magenta}

actions:
  - type: swap
    description: Interchanges the positions of pixels of different colors.
  - type: rotate
    description: rotate image.
  - type: reflect
    description: reflect image.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid, with row and column positions.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all magenta (6) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all white (0) pixels in the input grid.
3. **Swap**: Perform a counter clockwise rotation of the colors.
   *   Magenta becomes white
   *   White becomes magenta
   *   Top Left White becomes Top Left Magenta.

Another way to state it, is that we perform a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees on the image.
