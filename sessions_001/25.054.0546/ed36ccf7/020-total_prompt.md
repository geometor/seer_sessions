## Example 4

**input:**
```
2 0 0
0 0 2
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE5FDE40>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 0 2
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBE558B20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The grid cells contain either the value '2' (red) or '0' (white). The transformation seems to involve some rearrangement of the '2' (red) pixels within the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    cells:
      - value: 0  # White
        type: pixel
      - value: 2  # Red
        type: pixel
properties:
  - color:
      0: white
      2: red
actions:
  - type: rearrangement
    description: Red pixels are moved/repositioned within the grid.
relationships:
  - spatial: Cells are arranged in a 2D grid (rows and columns).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation appears to rotate the grid by 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Specifically:
1.  The red pixel at the top-left (0,0) moves to the top-right (0,2).
2.  The red pixel at the top-right (0,2) moves to bottom-right (2,2)
3. The red pixel at the bottom-right(2,2) moves to bottom-left(2,0)
4. the red pixel at the bottom-left(2,0) moves to top-left(0,0)
5. All other cells are untouched.

A more concise way, the output grid is a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
