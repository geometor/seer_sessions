## Example 4

**input:**
```
2 2 4
2 2 4
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF03F130>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF03EFE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains pixels of colors corresponding to the values 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 4 (yellow). The output grid contains pixels of colors corresponding to the values 0 (white) and 5 (gray). The spatial arrangement of the pixels appears crucial. It seems the bottom row's colors in the input are changed.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [1, 2, 4]
    output_colors: [0, 5]
  - object: row_1
    type: grid_row
    input_pixels: [2, 2, 4]
    output_pixels: [0, 0, 0]
  - object: row_2
    type: grid_row
    input_pixels: [2, 2, 4]
    output_pixels: [0, 0, 0]
  - object: row_3
    type: grid_row
    input_pixels: [1, 1, 1]
    output_pixels: [5, 5, 5]
  - observation: "Rows 1 and 2 in the input grid, which contain 2s and 4s, become all 0s in the output."
  - observation: "Row 3 in the input grid, which contains 1s, becomes all 5s in the output."
  - transformation: "Input pixels of values other than 1 appear replaced with 0. All 1s are replaced by 5."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **If** the pixel's value is 1 (blue), **change** it to 5 (gray) in the output grid.
3.  **Otherwise**, **change** the pixel's value to 0 (white) in the output grid.
4. **Return** the changed grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
