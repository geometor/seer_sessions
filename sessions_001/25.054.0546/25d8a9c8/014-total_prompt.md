## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 4
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEF4A8F0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
5 5 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF03EFE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels to another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid has a variety of colors (red, maroon, yellow), while the output grid has only two colors (white, gray). The transformation seems to involve a change in color based on some property of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (0-9)

actions:
  - type: transformation
    input: grid
    output: grid
    description: Changes pixel colors based on an unknown rule.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - type: color_change
    description: Input pixel colors map to output pixel colors.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe the Input:** Examine the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Conditional Color Change:**
    *   If an input pixel is yellow (4), change it to gray (5) in the output grid.
    *  If the input pixel is red (2), change it to white(0)
    *   If an input pixel is maroon (9), change it to gray (5) in the output grid.

Essentially, the input pixels that have values 2, 9 change to 0, 5 and the pixels that is value 4 changes to 5.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
