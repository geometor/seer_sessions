## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 4
2 3 2
2 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF03F130>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEF4B700>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid with numerical values representing colors. The colors present are yellow (4), red (2), and green (3).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid with numerical values, also likely representing colors. The colors present are gray (5) and white (0).
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve a change in color based on the original color in the input. It appears there is a mapping, and potentially a positional or structural change may also be possible, although a static change is more likely.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and Output are 3x3 grids.
  - object: cells
    properties:
      - color: Represents a numerical value (0-9).
    input_values:
      - 4 (yellow)
      - 2 (red)
      - 3 (green)
    output_values:
       - 5 (gray)
       - 0 (white)
  - relationship: color_mapping
    description: input color is mapped to corresponding output color
    mapping:
      - input: 4
        output: 5
      - input: 2
        output: 0
      - input: 3
        output: 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color value of the current cell.
3.  **Map** input color to output color
    *   If the input cell color is yellow (4), change it to gray (5) in the output grid.
    *   If the input cell color is red (2) or green(3), change it to white (0) in the output grid.
4.  **Place** mapped value into the corresponding cell in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
