"""
The transformation rule appears to perform a color replacement. Examine the input grid. If a pixel is orange (7) or green (3), change it to white (0). If a pixel is magenta (6), change it to gray (5). All other colors, if any, remain unchanged, although, in this example, only these three colors are present. The position of the pixels within the grid does not appear to affect the color changes.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too specific to the colors observed in the first training example. While the code correctly handled the second example (which had similar color transformations), it failed on the third and fourth examples because it didn't account for other color mappings present in the complete training set. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was incomplete. The strategy for resolution is to perform a comprehensive color mapping analysis across *all* training examples, identifying *all* input-output color pairs, and building a complete color translation rule.

**Metrics and Observations via Code Execution:**

To accurately assess the color mappings, I need to analyze all input/output pairs. I will use code execution to compare the input and expected output for all examples, generating these deliverables:

- report on colors in the training set
- report on the accuracy, and the specific pixels that are wrong

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

def analyze_examples(examples):
    """Analyzes input-output pairs to determine color mappings and errors."""

    all_input_colors = Counter()
    all_output_colors = Counter()
    color_mappings = {}
    error_details = []
    pixel_diffs = {}


    for idx, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(examples):

        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_output = np.array(expected_output)

        all_input_colors.update(input_grid.flatten())
        all_output_colors.update(expected_output.flatten())

        # Determine color mappings
        for color in np.unique(input_grid):
            corresponding_output_colors = expected_output[input_grid == color]
            if len(np.unique(corresponding_output_colors)) == 1:
                color_mappings[color] = corresponding_output_colors[0]
            else:
                # Handle cases where a single input color maps to multiple output colors
                color_mappings[color] = tuple(np.unique(corresponding_output_colors))  # Store as a tuple

        # pixels that don't match
        diff = input_grid != expected_output
        if diff.any():
            # record which colors where incorrect
            pixel_diffs[f'{idx}'] = diff.sum()

            rows, cols = np.where(diff)
            incorrect_pixels = []
            for r, c in zip(rows, cols):
                incorrect_pixels.append(
                    {
                        "row": int(r),

                        "input_color": int(input_grid[r, c]),
                        "expected_color": int(expected_output[r, c]),
                    }

                {"example_index": idx, "incorrect_pixels": incorrect_pixels}
            )


    print("Color Mapping Report:")
    for in_color, out_color in color_mappings.items():
        print(f"  Input Color: {in_color} -> Output Color: {out_color}")
    print("\nError Report:")
    for error in error_details:

      - input: 4
        output: 4
      - input: 9
        output: 9
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a color substitution.  Examine each pixel in the input grid. If the pixel is green (3) or orange (7), change it to white (0). If the pixel is magenta (6), change it to gray (5). All other colors remain unchanged. The pixel's position in the grid does not affect this transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
