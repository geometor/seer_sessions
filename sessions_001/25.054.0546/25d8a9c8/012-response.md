The transformation rule is a color substitution. Examine each pixel in the input grid. If the pixel is green (3) or orange (7), change it to white (0). If the pixel is magenta (6), change it to gray (5). All other colors remain unchanged. The pixel's position in the grid does not affect this transformation.
