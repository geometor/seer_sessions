            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided data and the results of the executed code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was likely based on a very simple hypothesis, probably something like \"extract the non-white pixels\". It seems to have worked for the first example, but fails on subsequent examples. This is expected, as ARC tasks often require iterative refinement of the solution. The strategy now is to examine *why* the code fails on the other examples and to adjust the natural language program and, consequently, the code, to account for these discrepancies. The metrics generated by the code are helpful for quantifying the differences between inputs, expected outputs, and (when available) the transformed outputs.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nThe provided code execution output gives us useful metrics. Let's summarize them in a more readable way, focusing on the key differences and patterns:\n```\nExample 1:\n  input_shape: (3, 3)\n  expected_output_shape: (1, 2)\n  input_colors: [0, 1]  (white, blue)\n  expected_output_colors: [1] (blue)\n  input_has_single_non_white_color: True\n  count_of_non_white_pixels: 2\n  expected_has_single_non_white_color: True\n  expected_count: 2\n  match: True\n\nExample 2:\n  input_shape: (3, 3)\n  expected_output_shape: (1, 3)\n  input_colors: [0, 2] (white, red)\n  expected_output_colors: [2] (red)\n  input_has_single_non_white_color: True\n  count_of_non_white_pixels: 3\n  expected_has_single_non_white_color: True\n  expected_count: 3\n  match: False\n\nExample 3:\n  input_shape: (3, 3)\n  expected_output_shape: (1, 1)\n  input_colors: [0, 7] (white, orange)\n  expected_output_colors: [7] (orange)\n  input_has_single_non_white_color: True\n  count_of_non_white_pixels: 1\n  expected_has_single_non_white_color: True\n  expected_count: 1\n  match: False\n\nExample 4:\n  input_shape: (3, 3)\n  expected_output_shape: (1, 4)\n  input_colors: [0, 8] (white, azure)\n  expected_output_colors: [8] (azure)\n  input_has_single_non_white_color: True\n  count_of_non_white_pixels: 4\n  expected_has_single_non_white_color: True\n  expected_count: 4\n  match: False\n```\n\nKey Observations:\n\n1.  **Single Non-White Color:** All input grids and their corresponding output grids contain only one non-white color. This seems to be a crucial consistent property.\n2.  **Varying Non-White Pixel Count:** The number of non-white pixels varies in the input grids. This count also appears in the expected outputs. The code identified this correctly.\n3. **Output shape changes:** the output shape is always 1 row, but the number of columns changes. This appears to be related to the number of non-white pixels.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: Each input grid contains only one non-white color.\n  - observation: Each output grid contains only the same non-white color as its corresponding input grid.\n  - observation: The number of pixels of the non-white color in the input grid varies.\n  - observation: The output grid always has one row.\n  - observation:  The output grid's width (number of columns) is equal to the number of non-white pixels in the input grid.\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - contains_single_non_white_color: True\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - contains_single_non_white_color: True\n      - shape: (1, x) #where x is the number of columns.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify the single non-white color in the input grid.\n2.  Count the number of pixels of that color in the input grid.\n3.  Create a new grid with one row and a number of columns equal to the count from step 2.\n4.  Fill all the cells of the new grid with the identified non-white color.\n\nThis natural language program encapsulates the core logic of the transformation, addressing the observed patterns and correcting the shortcomings of the implied initial hypothesis. It directly addresses the relationship between the number of non-white pixels and the output grid's dimensions.\n"
