## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFDC0>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x737FBEF4BDC0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). The transformation seems to involve extracting or counting the blue pixels (1s) from the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: [0, 1]
    role: input
    description: Input grid containing white (0) and blue (1) pixels.
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [1, 2]
    elements: [1]
    role: output
    description: Output grid containing only blue (1) pixels.

actions:
  - type: count
    target: "blue pixels (1)"
    from: input_grid
    result: count_of_ones

  - type: construct
    target: output_grid
    dimensions:
       height: 1
       width: "count_of_ones"
    elements: 1

relationships:
  - type: element_of
    subject: "0, 1"
    object: input_grid
  - type: element_of
    subject: "1"
    object: output_grid
  - type: transformation
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    rule: natural_language_program

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of blue pixels (cells with value 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid with a height of 1 and a width equal to the count of blue pixels from the input grid.
3. **Populate Output:** Fill all cells of the output grid with the value 1 (blue).

In summary, the transformation extracts the blue pixels from the input 3x3 grid and represents their count as the width of a new 1-row output grid filled with blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
