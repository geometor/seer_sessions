Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too specific, focusing only on azure pixels at the corners. The examples reveal a broader pattern: counting *any* non-black (non-zero) colored pixels located at the corners of the input grid. The output is always a 1x1 grid, with the single cell representing the *count* of these corner pixels, and the color of the pixel in the output should represent the count itself, not be fixed as red.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Broaden the Color Check:** Instead of checking for `== 8` (azure), check for `!= 0` (not black). This will include any non-black color.
2.  **Correct Output Color:** output value should match the count.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of the examples, incorporating a more accurate understanding:

| Example | Input Shape | Corner Colors (TL, TR, BL, BR)                | Expected Count | Actual Count (from code) | Matches Expected? | Notes                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 3x3         | (5, 0, 0, 0)                    | 1              | 0                        | No                | Initial code only looked for azure (8). Count should reflect gray (5).              |
| 2       | 3x3         | (8, 8, 8, 8)                     | 4              | 4                        | Yes                | Initial code correctly identifies azure.                                                                  |
| 3       | 3x3         | (5, 5, 5, 5)                      | 4             | 0                        | Yes                |Initial code would have counted 0.                                           |
| 4       | 3x3         | (0, 1, 1, 0)                   | 2              | 0                        | No                | Initial code only looked for azure. Should count the blue (1) pixels.                                  |
| 5       | 3x3         | (0, 8, 8, 0)                  | 2              | 2                        | No                |   The code got the correct number but should use color 2 (red) and not always color 2 (red)    |
| 6       | 3x3         | (4, 0, 0, 0)                     | 1              | 0                        | No                | Initial code only looked for azure. Should count the yellow (4) pixel.                                  |
| 7       | 3x3         | (0, 0, 0, 0)                    | 0              | 0                        | No                |    The code go the correct number but should output color 0, and not red                  |

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - corners: [top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]
      - colors: [0-9] # All possible colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - shape: 1x1
      - value: count_of_non_black_corners

actions:
  - name: count_non_black_corners
    input: input_grid
    process: |
      Iterate through the corner positions (top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right) of the input grid.
      For each corner, check if the pixel color is not black (value != 0).
      Increment a counter for each non-black corner pixel.
    output: count

  - name: create_output
    input: count
    process: Create a 1x1 grid where the single cell's value represents the 'count'.
    output: output_grid
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the Corners:** Check the color of the pixel at each of the four corners of the input grid (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right).
2.  **Count Non-Black Pixels:** Count how many of these corner pixels have a color that is *not* black (i.e., their value is not 0).
3.  **Create Output:** Create a 1x1 output grid. The value of the single pixel in this grid should be equal to the count of non-black corner pixels obtained in step 2. The output color should correspond with the count.
