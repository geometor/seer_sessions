## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 0 8
0 8 0
8 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBC74B0D0>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x737FBC7495D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The output is a single number, 2, on what could be a 1x1 red (2) grid. The key seems to be relating the number of a certain kind of element in the input to the output number. It might represent a count, or something to do with the geometry or layout of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), (1,1)]
      - color: white (0)
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]
  - type: scalar
    value: 2
    color: red (2)

relationships:
  - type: count
    description: The output scalar might be a function of something in the input grid, like the number of colored squares in specific area

actions:
  - type: observation
    description: Observe the occurrences of '8' (azure) and their positions.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe:** Examine the input grid.
2.  **Count:** Count the number of azure (8) pixels that are on a corner of the 3x3 grid.
3.  **Output:** The output is this count displayed inside a red square.

In simpler terms: Count the azure pixels at the corners of the input grid. This count is the output number and should have a red background.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
