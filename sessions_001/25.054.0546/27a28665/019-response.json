The output is a single numerical digit, `3`, inside a box/grid colored with value of the number `3`, green. The core task appears to be counting something within the input grid. Given prior knowledge, that 0 and 1 usually stand for on or off, and boolean logic, it's likely we are counting number of blue pixels (or pixels of value `1`).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
