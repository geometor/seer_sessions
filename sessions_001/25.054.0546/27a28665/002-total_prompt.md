## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 0
5 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFDC0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x737FBF03F130>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing the digits 0 and 5. The colors are grey (5) and white (0). The output is a single digit, 1, in a 1x1 grid, filled with blue color. The relationship appears to be counting specific elements within the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 5
        color: grey
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,2], [2,1]]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0,2], [1,1], [2,0], [2,2]]
  - type: scalar
    description: output value
    value: 1
    color: blue
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of occurrences of the digit `0` (white pixels) along the diagonals of the input grid. The main diagonal runs from the top-left to the bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal runs from the top-right to the bottom-left.
2.  The output is a 1x1 grid.
3. Set the value of the output grid to be the number of white cells in the diagonals.

The program is performing a count of specific colored cells on a set of locations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
