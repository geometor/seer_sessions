objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)

actions:
  - replace_color:
      input: original_color
      output: new_color
      rule: >
        If original color is not blue (1), replace it according to the rule: 
        If the color is 2 or 3 or 8, change it to 5. Otherwise retain the original color.

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - color_change: a mapping (potentially conditional) exists between input and output pixel colors.
