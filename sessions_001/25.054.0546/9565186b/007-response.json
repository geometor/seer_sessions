The input grid contains a variety of colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors to only blue and gray. The central pixel remains blue in both. The other colors are replaced based on some rule related to their color, it seems.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
