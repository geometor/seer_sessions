facts:
  - task_id: 022
  - object_types:
      - grid: 2D array of color values
      - row: 1D array of color values, a horizontal slice of the grid
      - pixel: single cell within the grid, represented by a color value
  - properties:
      - color: integer representing the color of a pixel (0-9)
      - uniform_row: a row where all pixels have the same color
      - retained_color: the color that is preserved in the output grid
      - dimensions: height and width of the grid
  - actions:
      - identify_all_colors: find all unique color values in the input
      - check_uniform_row: determine if any row is uniform in color
      - determine_retained_color: select the color of the uniform row
      - create_output_grid: generate a new grid of the same dimensions as input, filled with gray (5)
      - populate_output_grid: replace gray pixels with the retained color where it matches the input
  - example_results:
    - example_1:
        match: False
        retained_color: 2 (incorrectly identified as 5)
        notes: top row uniform
    - example_2:
        match: False
        retained_color: 1 (incorrectly identified as 5)
        notes: top row is uniform
    - example_3:
        match: True
        retained_color: 2
        notes: Top and bottom rows are uniform and color 2
    - example_4:
        match: True
        retained_color: 4
        notes: middle row uniform
