## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 1
8 1 3
8 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEFB00A0>

**output:**
```
1 1 1
5 1 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF03F130>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a variety of colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors to only blue and gray. The central pixel remains blue in both. The other colors are replaced based on some rule related to their color, it seems.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)

actions:
  - replace_color:
      input: original_color
      output: new_color
      rule: >
        If original color is not blue (1), replace it according to the rule: 
        If the color is 2 or 3 or 8, change it to 5. Otherwise retain the original color.

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - color_change: a mapping (potentially conditional) exists between input and output pixel colors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of the current pixel.
3.  **If** the color is blue (1), keep the same color in the output grid.
4.  **Else If** the color of pixel is 2, 3, or 8 (red, green, azure):
    *   **Change** color to gray (5) in output grid
5.  **Else** (for other colors): Retain the original color.
6.  **Place** each transformed or kept color value in the output grid using index from iteration.

Essentially, the transformation preserves blue pixels and converts red, green, and azure, pixels to gray, while retaining the rest.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
