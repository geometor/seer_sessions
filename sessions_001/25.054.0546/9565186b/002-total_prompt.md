## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEFB2920>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEFB00A0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors in the input grid are red (2), blue (1), and azure (8). The output grid retains the red (2) pixels but replaces both the blue (1) and azure (8) pixels with gray (5) pixels. The core transformation appears to be a color replacement based on the initial color. The shape and size of the grid remains constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are both 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains colors red (2), blue (1), and azure (8).
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains colors red (2) and gray (5).
  - relationship: |
      Pixels with the value 2 in the input grid remain 2 in the output grid.
  - relationship: |
      Pixels with values 1 or 8 in the input grid become 5 in the output grid.
  - action: |
     Colors are replaced in place, the position in the grid remains constant.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  If the pixel's value is 2 (red), keep the value as 2 in the output grid.
3.  If the pixel's value is 1 (blue) or 8 (azure), change the value to 5 (gray) in the output grid.
4.  Otherwise, output the original value. (Although this isn't necessary according to this example, adding a default condition here could prevent errors on future tasks.)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
