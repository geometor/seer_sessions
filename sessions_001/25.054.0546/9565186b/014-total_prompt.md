## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 2
8 8 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBEFB00A0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
5 5 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x737FBF1AFC10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains red (2) and azure (8) pixels. The output grid contains red (2) and gray (5) pixels. The transformation seems to be localized to the central horizontal line of the grid. The azure pixels in the input are replaced with gray pixels, the red pixels stay red.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        values: [red, azure, gray]
        mapping:
          red: 2
          azure: 8
          gray: 5

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    input_color: azure
    output_color: gray
    location: central_horizontal_line

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The grid is a 2D arrangement of pixels.
  - type: transformation
    description: Input pixels on the central horizontal line are changed based on their color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central horizontal line:** Locate the middle row of the 3x3 grid.
2.  **Check for azure:** Iterate through the pixels on this central line.
3.   **Change Azure to Grey:** If a pixel on the central line is azure (8), change it to gray (5).
4.  **Preserve other colors:** All other pixels, specifically the red (2) ones, and those not on the central line, remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
