            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the transformation rule, updated metrics, a YAML block documenting facts, and a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (replacing azure pixels in the middle row with gray) was too specific. While it worked for Example 3, it failed for Examples 1, 2, and 4. The core issue is that the transformation rule needs to consider *all* azure pixels, not just those in the middle row, and it needs to apply this rule *consistently across the entire grid*. The strategy should be to generalize the rule to all azure pixels, and to replace all the azure pixels in the entire grid with grey.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis of Each Example**\n\nTo confirm, I've executed the code and confirmed it against these assumptions:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The initial rule only changed one of the azure pixels to gray. Two azure pixels remain unchanged and one blue pixel remains.\n*   **Example 2:** The initial rule changed one azure pixel to gray. One other azure remains, one green and one blue pixel remains.\n*   **Example 3:** The initial rule correctly changed all azure pixels to gray. This is consistent with the generalized rule.\n*   **Example 4:** No azure changes were made because there are no azure pixels in the middle row, but it is the correct behaviour, given the initial hypothesis.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 015\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      - colors: [blue, red, green, yellow, gray, azure] # Colors present in the grids\n      - dimensions: variable (3x3 in examples)\n\ntransformations:\n  - name: color_replacement\n    input_color: azure\n    output_color: gray\n    scope: all_pixels # All pixels in the grid\n\nrules:\n  - description: Replace all instances of a specific color with another color.\n    condition: \"pixel color is azure\"\n    action: \"change pixel color to gray\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  **Replace with Gray:** If a pixel's color is azure (value 8), change its color to gray (value 5).\n3. **Output:** The output is copy of the input grid, except that all azure pixels are changed to grey.\n\nThis natural language program describes a simple, global color replacement rule.\n"
