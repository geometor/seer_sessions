The task seems to involve transforming regions of a specific color (azure/8) within the grid. The strategy to resolve this task involves:\n\n1.  **Visual Inspection:**  Compare the input and output grids visually to identify the changes.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Identify the objects being manipulated (regions of color 8).\n3.  **Transformation Rule Derivation:** Deduce the rule that transforms the input to the output by analyzing the changes made to the objects.\n4.  **Metric Gathering:** Use code to quantify the properties of the input and output grids and the objects within them to support the derived rule.\n5.  **YAML and Natural Language Documentation:** Document the findings in structured YAML and natural language program formats for clarity and for the coder phase.\n\n## Metrics and Reports\n\nLet's gather metrics about the example input and output grids.\n\n"

Within each distinct azure region, change the color of one pixel that is adjacent to a white pixel (color 0) to blue (color 1). If a region has multiple pixels adjacent to white pixels, choose only one to change. If a region has no pixels adjacent to white pixels, do not change any pixel in that region. Apply this transformation to all azure regions in the input grid to generate the output grid.\n\n**Refinement of Natural Language Program (Attempt 2 - based on closer inspection)**\n\nThe task is to identify regions of azure pixels (color 8). Within each distinct azure region, find the azure pixel that is immediately to the *right* of another azure pixel and is itself adjacent (including diagonals) to a white pixel (color 0). Change the color of *that* pixel to blue (color 1). If such a pixel exists in a region, change only *one* such pixel per region. If no such pixel exists, do not change any pixel in that region. Apply this transformation to all azure regions in the input grid to generate the output grid.\n\n**Further Refinement (Attempt 3 - more precise pixel selection)**\n\nThe task is to identify connected regions of azure pixels (color 8).  For each such region:\n\n1.  Find all azure pixels within the region that satisfy *both* of these conditions:\n    *   The pixel is *immediately to the right* of another azure pixel in the same region (i.e., has an azure pixel to its left).\n    *   The pixel is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one white pixel (color 0).\n2.  If there are any pixels satisfying both conditions in a region, choose *one* of them and change its color to blue (color 1). If multiple pixels satisfy the condition, the choice of which one to change doesn't seem to be specified by this single example, but for now, let's assume we just pick the first one we find. If no pixel satisfies both conditions in a region, do not change any pixels in that region.\n\nApply this process to each connected azure region in the input grid to produce the output grid.\n\nThis refined natural language program appears to accurately describe the transformation observed in the example. The next step would be for the coder to implement this logic."
