Previous Code:
```python
"""
The task is to identify connected regions of azure pixels (color 8).  For each such region:

1.  Find all azure pixels within the region that satisfy *both* of these conditions:
    *   The pixel is *immediately to the right* of another azure pixel in the same region (i.e., has an azure pixel to its left).
    *   The pixel is adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to at least one white pixel (color 0).
2.  If there are any pixels satisfying both conditions in a region, choose *one* of them and change its color to blue (color 1). If multiple pixels satisfy the condition, the choice of which one to change doesn't seem to be specified by this single example, but for now, let's assume we just pick the first one we find. If no pixel satisfies both conditions in a region, do not change any pixels in that region.

Apply this process to each connected azure region in the input grid to produce the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
