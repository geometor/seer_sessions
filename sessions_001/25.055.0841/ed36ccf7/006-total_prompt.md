## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 6 6
0 0 0
6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3A64130>

**output:**
```
6 0 0
6 0 6
6 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3A659C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a color value represented by an integer (0 or 6 in this case). The input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a change in the position of colors/values, a vertical flip, and a specific replacement rule based on position.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          type: integer
          values: [0, 6]

actions:
  - name: transform
    type: grid-to-grid
    description: Modifies pixel colors based on their position and original color.

relationships:
 - type: spatial
   description: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid with row and column indices.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colors:** The input grid contains two colors: magenta (6) and white (0).
2.  **Vertical Flip, then rotate right:** Consider the first row of the original, to become the last column of the output.
3.  **Color Preservation and Change:**
    *   Magenta (6) pixels on corners remain.
    *   Magenta (6) which appear in row=0, change to (0).
    *   Pixels with White (0) remain unchanged.

In summary, the rule rotates the grid to the right one position, keeping original
values for white (0), but for magenta (6) in the original first row becomes white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
