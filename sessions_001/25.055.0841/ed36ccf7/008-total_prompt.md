The transformation rule involves rotating the input grid to the right by one position. 
Pixels that are white (0) in the input remain unchanged. 
Pixels that are magenta (6) in the first row of the input grid are changed to white (0) in the output grid.

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])

    # Rotate the grid to the right by transposing and flipping.
    output_grid = np.rot90(input_grid, k=-1)

    # Apply the rule. The original first row becomes the last column in rotated grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and description focused on a rightward rotation and a specific color change (magenta to white) in the first row. However, the test results on the training examples reveal that this description is incomplete and inaccurate in several cases. The rotation aspect seems correct, but the color change rule needs refinement. It's not just about the first row of the input, and the magenta pixels aren't always changing to white. There is also the corner cases, which don't seem to be handled correctly. We need to carefully examine *which* magenta pixels change and to *what* color they change, based on their position *after* the rotation.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Observation:** We need to meticulously compare each input-output pair, paying close attention to the position and color of *every* pixel, especially the magenta ones.
2.  **Object Recognition:** I need to identify what counts as the core object. Are these single-colored continuous blocks or any collection of pixels, or are they a row or column based shape?
3.  **Post-Rotation Focus:** Since the rotation seems to be handled correctly, we should focus on the state of the grid *after* the rotation to determine the color change rules.
4.  **Rule Refinement:** We'll iteratively refine the natural language program and the corresponding code based on the observed discrepancies.
5.  **Context:** Consider the context and ensure that there are no hidden, or implied rules such as object interactions.

**YAML Facts:**

      input_objects:
        - object_1: Single magenta (6) pixel at [2,2].
      transformation:
        - action: Rotation 90 degrees clockwise.
        - result: Magenta pixel moves to [2,3].
      output_objects:
          - object_1: Single magenta pixel remains unchanged.
  - example_1:
      input_objects:

        - object_2: Magenta (6) pixel at [1, 3].
      transformation:

         - object_2: Magenta (6) pixel at [2, 7].
      transformation:
        - action: Rotation 90 degrees clockwise.
        - result: Magenta pixel at [0, 0] moves to [0, 0].
        - result: Magenta pixel at [2, 7] moves to [7, 0]
      output_objects:
          - object_1: Magenta pixel remains unchanged.
          - object_2: Magenta pixel remains unchanged.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Preserve Magenta:** All magenta (6) pixels remain in their new rotated positions.
3. **No Change:** All other pixels and colors remain unchanged.

This revised natural language program accurately describes the transformation observed in all three training examples. The key improvement is recognizing that the magenta pixels are simply preserved after rotation, and there's no conditional color change.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
