Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation repositions a 1x2 block of white pixels (0) from the top-right to the top-left of a 3x3 grid, filling the remaining cells with maroon pixels (9).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by moving the white pixels to the top-left.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with maroon pixels.
    output_grid = np.full((3, 3), 9)

    # Place the white pixels at the top-left.
    output_grid[0, 0] = 0
    output_grid[1, 0] = 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified transformation rule. The results from the additional training examples reveal that the actual transformation is more specific about *where* the 1x2 white block originates (top-right) and consistently places it at the top-left, filling the rest of the 3x3 grid with maroon. The generated code happens to work for more of the examples than might be expected, but the natural language program is not completely accurate and the error in example_3 confirms it needs revision. The core issue is a premature generalization from a single observation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Observation:** Carefully examine *all* input-output pairs, noting the precise location and orientation of the 1x2 white block in the input and its consistent placement in the output.
2.  **Refine Description:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed "move" of the white block and the filling of remaining cells.
3. **Confirm**: re-run to confirm that error rate is now zero.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To accurately describe what's happening, I'll create small reports of what is in the input, and what is in the output.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid, grid_name):
    """Describes the contents of a grid."""

    print(f"Grid: {grid_name}")
    white_pixels = np.where(grid == 0)
    if len(white_pixels[0]) > 0:
        print(f"  White Pixels: {list(zip(white_pixels[0], white_pixels[1]))}")
    else:
        print("  White Pixels: None")
    maroon_pixels = np.where(grid == 9)
    if len(maroon_pixels[0]) > 0:
      print(f"  Maroon Pixels: {list(zip(maroon_pixels[0], maroon_pixels[1]))}")
    else:
      print("  Maroon Pixels: None")

    print(f"{grid_name} shape: {grid.shape}")


# input and output grid values from prompt history
example_grids = {
    "example_0_input": np.array([[9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_0_output": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_1_input": np.array([[9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 0]]),
    "example_1_output": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_2_input": np.array([[9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 0], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_2_output": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_3_input": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
    "example_3_output": np.array([[0, 9, 9], [0, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9]]),
}

for grid_name, grid in example_grids.items():
    describe_grid(grid, grid_name)

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
