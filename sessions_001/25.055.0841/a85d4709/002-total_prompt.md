## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3BC6BC0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3BC6BF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the value '0' (white) and '5' (gray). The output grid contains values '3' (green), '4' (yellow), and '2' (red). There's a clear positional correspondence: the transformation replaces every element, and the relative position of each element remains the same. The core of the task is to figure out the rule determining *which* color in the input becomes *which* other color in the output. The transformation appears to be a simple mapping or substitution of color values, not a spatial or geometric manipulation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - name: color
        values: [white, gray, green, yellow, red]

actions:
  - type: substitution
    description: Each element's value in the input grid is replaced by a different value in the output grid.
    properties:
      - input_value: 0
        output_value: 3
      - input_value: 5
        output_value: 4
      - inferred_value: x
        output_value: 2
relationships:
  - type: positional_correspondence
    description: The position of each element is preserved during the transformation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Substitution:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   If the cell's value is 0 (white), replace it with 3 (green).
    *   If the cell's value is 5 (gray), replace it with 4 (yellow).
    *   If the cell has any other value, replace it by 2 (red).
3.  **Output:** The result is the transformed 3x3 grid.

In essence the program describes a very simple replacement of numbers in a grid with other numbers based on their initial value, and includes a "catch-all" to make sure any unspecified color is transformed to a specific value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
