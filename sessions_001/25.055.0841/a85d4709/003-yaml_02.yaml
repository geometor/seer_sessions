observations:
  - example: 1
    input:
      objects:
        - color: white
          shape: 3x3 grid
        - color: gray
          shape: single pixel
          location: center
    output:
      objects:
        - color: green
          shape: 3x3 grid except center
        - color: yellow
          shape: single pixel
          location: center
    transformation:  All white pixels become green, gray pixel becomes yellow.

  - example: 2 (Hypothetical Failure)
    input:
      objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: 2x2 cross, center empty, symmetrical
        - color: white
          shape: 2x2 cross, center filled, symmetrical

    output:
      objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape:  2x2 cross, center empty, symmetrical
      - color: green
        shape: 2x2 cross, center filled, symmetrical
    transformation: All gray pixels become yellow and all white pixels become green. This description holds, but we expect the test to have failed.

  - example: 3 (Hypothetical Failure)
    input:
     objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: 3x3 grid
        - color: white
          shape: single pixel
          location: center
    output:
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: 3x3 grid except center
        - color: green
          shape: single pixel
          location: center
    transformation:  All gray pixels become yellow, white pixel becomes green.
