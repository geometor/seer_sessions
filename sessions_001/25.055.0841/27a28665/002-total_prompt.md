## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 0
5 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3714A60>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7126B3714C70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a single-pixel grid. The input grid seems to have a pattern of gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output is a single blue (1) pixel. The core challenge is to determine the rule that decides when the output is blue (1), based on the arrangement of colors in the input.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 3x3 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a color value, either 0 (white) or 5 (gray).
  - observation: |
      The output is a 1x1 grid, containing a single pixel with a color value of 1 (blue).
  - relationship: |
      The output color (blue) does not appear in the input grid.
  - hypothesis: |
      The transformation rule likely counts or assesses the presence of specific colors or patterns.
  - hypothesis: |
    the output might represent the number of times a specific object is detected.
  - hypothesis: |
       it could be based on the positions/relationships of different colors within the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count Gray Pixels:** Count the number of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2. Output the color blue if count of Gray pixel is greater than the count of white pixels.

Alternative Program (Less Likely):

1. Count Object: Count contiguous blocks of color 5
2. Output: Blue if this count > 1

Based on the prior of `Objectness`, the first program seems the best possible transformation, based on just a single example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
