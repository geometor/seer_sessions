observations:
  objects:
    - name: gray_region
      description: One or more connected gray (value 5) pixels.
      properties:
        - surrounded_by_white: A boolean indicating if all pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to the gray region are white (value 0).

  actions:
    - name: determine_output_color
      description: Sets the output pixel color based on the 'surrounded_by_white' property of the gray region.
      logic: |
        If any gray region is completely surrounded by white, the output is black (0).
        Otherwise, the output is blue (1).

  context: |
        The input is a grid of colored pixels. The output is a 1x1 grid.
        The task involves analyzing gray regions within the input grid to determine the output color.
