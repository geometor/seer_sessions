Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is expanded to create the output grid. The transformation involves a combination of mirroring and padding. The input grid is horizontally mirrored, with the central column preserved.  Then, it is vertically mirrored with an overlap. Finally, zeros (white) are added to the corners of the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height = len(input_grid)
    input_width = len(input_grid[0])
    output_height = 2 * input_height
    output_width = 2 * input_width - 1
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # copy rows of input to output, horizontal mirroring
    for row in range(input_height):
        for col in range(input_width):
            output_grid[row][col] = input_grid[row][col]
            output_grid[row][output_width - 1 - col] = input_grid[row][col]

    # duplicate rows, vertical mirroring
    for row in range(input_height):

    # pad with zeros is not necessary, as np.zeros was used

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
