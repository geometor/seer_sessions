## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 1
8 1 3
8 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3A659C0>

**output:**
```
1 1 1
5 1 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7126B3A662F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The colors are represented by single digits. The input grid has a variety of colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors to just two (blue and gray).  The blue (1) color seems to be preserved. The key seems to be replacing non-blue colors with grey (5).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [1, 8, 3, 2] # blue, azure, green, red
    output_colors: [1, 5] # blue, gray
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
  - action: color_change
    condition: original_color != 1
    result: new_color = 5
  - relationship: preservation
    element: blue_pixels (color=1)
    property: color and position are maintained
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of the current pixel.
3.  **If** the color is blue (1), keep the color and position the same in the output grid.
4.  **Else** (if the color is not blue), change the color to gray (5) in the output grid, maintaining the original position.

In essence, the transformation rule is: "Replace all non-blue pixels with gray pixels, preserving the position of all pixels."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
