The input grid has a distinct pattern: the top row is all red (2), and the center pixel is blue (1), while there is one red and two azure (8) pixels in the right lower corner. The output grid retains the red pixels (2) in the same positions but changes the blue (1) and azure (8) pixels to gray (5).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
