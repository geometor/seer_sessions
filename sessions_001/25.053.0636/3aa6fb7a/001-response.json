Observe and gather facts:**\n\nI'll start by visually inspecting the input and output grids, noting the objects, their positions, colors, and any changes. I will document these observations in a YAML block.\n\n**2. Identify patterns and relationships:**\n\nI will look for patterns in how objects are arranged and how they change between the input and output. I'll pay attention to:\n\n*   **Object persistence:** Do objects remain the same, change color, or disappear?\n*   **Spatial relationships:** How are objects positioned relative to each other?\n*   **Color changes:** Are there any consistent color transformations?\n*  **Movement:** Do object move and what constraints are followed?\n\n**3. Formulate a natural language program:**\n\nBased on my observations, I will create a step-by-step description of the transformation process in natural language. This will describe the rule that converts the input to the output.\n\n**4. Consider edge cases**\n\nThink about how the natural language program applies if there are no object, multiple objects, and different colors.\n\nHere's the YAML block with my initial observations:\n\n"
