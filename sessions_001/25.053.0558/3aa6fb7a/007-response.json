The azure pixels form distinct groups, which can be single pixels or lines (vertical or horizontal).\n\n2.  **Locate Change:**  The output introduces blue (1) pixels. These blue pixels consistently appear in locations that are adjacent to at least two *different* groups of azure pixels. It's crucial that the neighboring azure pixels belong to distinct groups; otherwise, no blue pixel is added.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Identify all distinct groups of contiguous azure pixels.\n    *   Iterate through each white (0) pixel in the grid.\n    *   For each white pixel, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    *   If a white pixel has neighbors belonging to *more than one* distinct azure group, change the white pixel to blue (1).\n\nThe key refinement here is the explicit requirement that the neighboring azure pixels must belong to *different* groups for the blue pixel to be placed. The previous description was slightly ambiguous on this point. This version clarifies the rule's logic and explains how the code works.\n"
