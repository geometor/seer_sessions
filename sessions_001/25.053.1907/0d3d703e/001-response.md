Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the digits 1, 2, and 3, representing blue, red, and green, respectively. The output grid contains the digits 4, 5, and 6, representing yellow, gray, and magenta. The spatial arrangement (rows and columns) remains identical between input and output. The transformation seems to be a consistent mapping of each input digit to a corresponding output digit.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - rows: 3
      - columns: 3
      - cell_values: Represent colors

actions:
  - type: mapping
    description: Each input digit is replaced by a corresponding output digit.
    input_values: [1, 2, 3]
    output_values: [5, 6, 4]

relationships:
  - type: spatial_invariance
    description: The position of each element within the grid remains constant during the transformation.
  - input_1: output_5
  - input_2: output_6
  - input_3: output_4
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:**
    *   Replace every occurrence of the digit '1' with the digit '5'.
    *   Replace every occurrence of the digit '2' with the digit '6'.
    *   Replace every occurrence of the digit '3' with the digit '4'.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid of integers, with the replacements made. The structure of the output grid is identical to that of the input grid.

Essentially, the program adds an offset of:
- input + 4 if input is 1, 2, or 3.
- input + 0 in all other cases
