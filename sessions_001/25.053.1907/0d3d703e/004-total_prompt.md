Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the subsequent code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited observation (only the first training example). It implemented a simple color mapping, but this mapping is clearly incomplete and incorrect, as evidenced by the failures in examples 2, 3, and 4. The strategy for resolving the errors is to:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine *all* input/output pairs to determine the *complete* color mapping rule.
2.  **Identify incorrect mappings:** Pinpoint the specific color transformations that the current code is handling incorrectly.
3.  **Revise the natural language program:** Update the description to reflect the full and correct mapping.
4.  **Update Code (for next phase):** Modify the python code to implement the corrected mapping.
5. Re-validate the result

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each example, including a clearer report on where the code succeeded and failed.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input:  `3 1 2` (repeated 3x)
    *   Expected Output: `4 5 6` (repeated 3x)
    *   Transformed Output: `4 5 6` (repeated 3x)
    *   Result: **Correct**. The initial mapping happened to be correct for these specific colors.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input:  `2 3 8` (repeated 3x)
    *   Expected Output: `6 4 9` (repeated 3x)
    *   Transformed Output: `6 4 8` (repeated 3x)
    *   Result: **Incorrect**.
        *   `2 -> 6`: Correct.
        *   `3 -> 4`: Correct.
        *   `8 -> 9`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 8 unchanged.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `5 8 6` (repeated 3x)
    *   Expected Output: `1 9 2` (repeated 3x)
    *   Transformed Output: `5 8 6` (repeated 3x)
    *   Result: **Incorrect**.
        *   `5 -> 1`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 5 unchanged.
        *   `8 -> 9`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 8 unchanged.
        *   `6 -> 2`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 6 unchanged.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `9 4 2` (repeated 3x)
    *   Expected Output: `8 3 6` (repeated 3x)
    *   Transformed Output: `9 4 6` (repeated 3x)
    *   Result: **Incorrect**.
        *   `9 -> 8`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 9 unchanged.
        *   `4 -> 3`: **Incorrect**. The code leaves 4 unchanged.
        *   `2 -> 6`: Correct.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 1
    input_colors: [3, 1, 2]
    output_colors: [4, 5, 6]
    mapping:
      3: 4
      1: 5
      2: 6
    result: correct
  - example: 2
    input_colors: [2, 3, 8]
    output_colors: [6, 4, 9]
    mapping:
      2: 6
      3: 4
      8: 9
    result: partially correct
  - example: 3
    input_colors: [5, 8, 6]
    output_colors: [1, 9, 2]
    mapping:
      5: 1
      8: 9
      6: 2
    result: incorrect
  - example: 4
    input_colors: [9, 4, 2]
    output_colors: [8, 3, 6]
    mapping:
      9: 8
      4: 3
      2: 6
    result: partially correct
  - summary: |
      The transformation is a one-to-one color mapping. Each color in
      the input grid is replaced by a different, specific color in
      the output grid. The mapping observed so far and that needs
      to hold in the general case:
          1 -> 5
          2 -> 6
          3 -> 4
          4 -> 3
          5 -> 1
          6 -> 2
          8 -> 9
          9 -> 8
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a one-to-one color mapping. Every pixel in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding, predefined color in the output grid. The specific color mapping is as follows:

*   Blue (1) becomes Gray (5)
*   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6)
*   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4)
*   Yellow (4) becomes Green (3)
*   Gray (5) becomes Blue (1)
*   Magenta (6) becomes Red (2)
*   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9)
*   Maroon (9) becomes Azure (8)
*   White (0) and Orange (7) remain unchanged.

This program provides a *complete* description based on all available training data. It corrects the deficiencies of the previous description, which was based only on the first example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
