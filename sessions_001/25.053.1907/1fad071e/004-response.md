Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and their results to understand the transformation rule and develop a natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a placeholder and did not implement any transformation. It simply printed details about the input, expected output, and a hardcoded "transformed output". The new information shows discrepancies between the `expected_output` and the hardcoded placeholder `transformed_output` in the provided code. Our strategy is to analyze the input and expected output grids for each example to discern a pattern or rule. Then modify the natural language program and, subsequently, update python code to implement the transformation rule. We need to determine what features of the input relate to the features of the output. Because the placeholder output is always a 1x5 grid filled with zeros except at the beginning, we should investigate the length of the output and the values.

**Metrics and Observations (using provided output of `analyze_example`):**

Here's a summary of the provided output, focusing on relevant data:

**Example 1:**

*   Input Dimensions: 9x9
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 1x5
*   Expected Output: `[1 1 0 0 0]`
*   Transformed Output (Placeholder): `[12 24 0 0 0]`
*   Match: False
*   Pixels off: 2

**Example 2:**

*   Input Dimensions: 9x9
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 1x5
*   Expected Output: `[1 1 1 1 0]`
*   Transformed Output (Placeholder): `[18 20 0 0 0]`
*   Match: False
*   Pixels off: 4

**Example 3:**

*   Input Dimensions: 9x9
*   Expected Output Dimensions: 1x5
*   Expected Output: `[1 1 1 1 0]`
*   Transformed Output (Placeholder): `[19 18 0 0 0]`
*   Match: False
*   Pixels off: 4

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_shape: [9, 9]
  output_shape: [1, 5]
  output_values: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
  blue_count: 4
example_2:
  input_shape: [9, 9]
  output_shape: [1, 5]
  output_values: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  blue_count: 8
example_3:
  input_shape: [9, 9]
  output_shape: [1, 5]
  output_values: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
  blue_count: 8
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count Blue Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid and count the number of blue (value 1) pixels.
2.  **Determine Output Length** The number of non-zero values (all '1's) is either the number of blue pixels, or the number of blue pixels / 2 (rounded up). In all cases, it is followed by 0s.
3. **Create output:** Create a 1x5 output grid. Fill '1's for non-zero values and the remainder are set to 0.
