# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 8 0
0 8 0 8
0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7EF8F235FB50>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7EF8F235FA60>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integer values, representing colors. The primary color observed is 0 (white) and 8 (azure). The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, both in terms of dimensions and the arrangement of the azure (8) pixels. The white (0) pixels seem to act as a background or filler.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: 3x4 (rows x columns)
        output: 6x8 (rows x columns)
      elements: pixels
      colors: [0, 8]  # 0: white, 8: azure

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded to double its original dimensions.
    details:
        rows: input_rows * 2
        cols: input_cols * 2

  - name: replicate_pattern
    description: The pattern of azure pixels is replicated in a specific way within the expanded grid.
    details: >
      The azure pixels in the output grid maintain their relative positions but also extend a copy to the right.
      Each row of the pattern is duplicated and repeats with each element repeating and extra space (0) is added on each side.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand the Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid. The number of rows in the output grid is twice the number of rows in the input grid. The number of columns in the output grid is twice the number of columns in the input grid.

2.  **Replicate and shift the azure pixels:** For each azure (8) pixel in the input, create a copy and a new cell to the right.

3. Fill with 0: all other locations are now filled with a 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
