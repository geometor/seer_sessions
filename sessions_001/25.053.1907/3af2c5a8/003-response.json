            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were overly specific to the first training example. It correctly identified the doubling of the grid dimensions and attempted to replicate/shift a specific color (azure - 8). However, it failed to generalize to other colors and patterns present in the subsequent examples. The core issue is that the rule is color-specific and doesn't account for the actual transformation logic, which seems to involve replicating *all* colors, not just azure, and expanding them in a 2x2 block pattern in the output grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine *all* input/output pairs to identify the common transformation rule. The rule works by expanding a 1x1 cell from the input grid into a 2x2 block.\n2.  **Generalize the Color:** Modify the logic to apply to *any* color present in the input grid, not just azure (8).\n3. **YAML Summary and Natural Language Program**: I will be sure to document my observations correctly and update the natural language program, this is the main method to solving the task.\n4.  **Revise Code:** Generate new Python code that reflects the updated, generalized transformation rule.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each example, including some targeted observations to guide the code revision:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    0 0 8 0\n    0 8 0 8\n    0 0 8 0\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n    0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\n    ```\n\n* **Problem**: Only expands and handles azure pixels, it does correctly expand but not in the correct location. It seems to understand the 2x2 expansion, but misapplies the row logic.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    0 0 3 3\n    0 3 0 3\n    3 3 3 0\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3\n    0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3\n    0 0 3 3 0 0 3 3\n    0 0 3 3 0 0 3 3\n    3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n    3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n    3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3\n    3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3\n    ```\n* **Problem**: The code does not replicate the green color. The output shows how the replication works.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    3 3 3 3\n    3 0 0 0\n    3 0 0 0\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    ```\n* **Problem**: Again the replication is missing, and only the azure color is moved.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: doubled in both rows and columns\n      - transformation: each input pixel becomes a 2x2 block in the output\n      - color_invariance: transformation applies to all colors, not just one\n  - action: replicate\n    details: Every pixel of input becomes a 2x2 block of the same color\n  - action: expand\n    details: Grid expands by a factor of 2.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Expand Grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to create the output grid.\n2.  **Replicate Pixels:** For *each* pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of the *same* color in the output grid. The top-left cell of this 2x2 block corresponds to the position of the original pixel multiplied by two. In other words: Every element at input\\_grid\\[row, col] becomes a 2x2 block at output\\_grid\\[row\\*2:row\\*2+2, col\\*2:col\\*2+2].\n\nThis revised natural language program is much more accurate and generalizable than the original. It captures the essence of the transformation without being tied to specific colors or edge cases.\n"
