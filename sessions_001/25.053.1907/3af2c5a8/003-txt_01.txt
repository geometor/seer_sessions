* **Problem**: Only expands and handles azure pixels, it does correctly expand but not in the correct location. It seems to understand the 2x2 expansion, but misapplies the row logic.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    0 0 3 3
    0 3 0 3
    3 3 3 0
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
    0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3
    0 0 3 3 0 0 3 3
    0 0 3 3 0 0 3 3
    3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0
    3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0
    3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3
    3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3
    ```
* **Problem**: The code does not replicate the green color. The output shows how the replication works.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    3 3 3 3
    3 0 0 0
    3 0 0 0
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
    3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```
* **Problem**: Again the replication is missing, and only the azure color is moved.
