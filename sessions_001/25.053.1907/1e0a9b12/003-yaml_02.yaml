facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Non-zero pixels in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: Non-zero pixels maintain their column index (x-coordinate).
  - observation: Non-zero pixels "stack" at the bottom of the output grid.
  - observation: The relative vertical order of non-zero pixels in a column is preserved.
  - observation: Zero pixels in the input are treated as empty space and are not explicitly preserved.
  - action: Iterate through each column of the input grid.
  - action: Collect all non-zero pixels within each column.
  - action: Place the collected non-zero pixels at the bottom of the corresponding column in the output grid, maintaining their order.
  - action: Fill any remaining cells at the top of each column in the output grid with zeros.
