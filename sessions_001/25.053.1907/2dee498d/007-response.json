The input grid is wider than the output grid. It appears that the output grid is a cropped version of the input grid. The colors and their relative positions within the overlapping region are identical between input and output. The cropping seems to be removing columns from the right side of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
