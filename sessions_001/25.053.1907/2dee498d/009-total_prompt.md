Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output grid is created by taking the leftmost portion of the input grid. Specifically, take the first four columns of the input grid to form the output grid. This is a simple horizontal cropping operation.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a numpy array
    output_grid = np.array(input_grid)

    # crop the grid by taking all rows and the first four columns
    output_grid = output_grid[:, :4]
    
    return output_grid.tolist() # return as a list

## Example 1:**

Input:
```
4 5 1 1 5 4 4 5 1
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
1 5 4 4 5 1 1 5 4
```
Expected Output:
```

5 5 5
1 5 4
```
Transformed Output:
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
