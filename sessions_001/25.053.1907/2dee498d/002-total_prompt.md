# Example

**input:**
```
4 5 1 1 5 4 4 5 1
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
1 5 4 4 5 1 1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x7EF8F235FA00>

**output:**
```
4 5 1
5 5 5
1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EF8F235FB50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting some form of reduction or extraction. The colors (represented by numbers) seem to be preserved in the transformation, while their arrangement and quantity are altered.  It looks like the input is simply being downscaled/cropped.  The core object is the entire grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colored pixels.
    properties:
      - height: number of rows
      - width: number of columns
      - cells: integer values (0-9) representing colors
    input_example:
      height: 3
      width: 9
      cells: [4, 5, 1, 1, 5, 4, 4, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 4, 4, 5, 1, 1, 5, 4]
    output_example:
      height: 3
      width: 3
      cells: [4, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 4]
  - action: reduction
    description: The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid.
    details:  The specific reduction appears to extract the top-left portion of the input grid.
  - relationship: correspondence
    description: Colors in the output grid correspond directly to colors in the same relative positions of the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation extracts the top-left 3x3 subgrid from the input grid.  The output grid is always 3x3. The program takes the input grid, and creates a new grid, by copying the value from the cell to a corresponding output cell from [0,0] to [2,2].

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
