Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts the top-left subgrid from the input grid. The output grid's dimensions are determined by taking the minimum of the input grid's dimensions and 3. Specifically, the output grid's number of rows is the minimum of 3 and the number of rows in the input grid. Similarly, the output grid's number of columns is the minimum of 3 and the number of columns in the input grid. The values in the output grid are copied from the corresponding positions in the input grid, starting at position [0, 0]. If the input grid has less than 3 rows or columns, the smaller of the dimensions is applied.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
