Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of identifying 2x2 blocks of azure (8) pixels and changing the "internal" azure pixels to blue (1). However, the results on the second training example reveal a flaw in this interpretation. It seems the rule isn't strictly about *completely filled* 2x2 blocks. Instead, the rule identifies *potential* 2x2 azure squares, even if interrupted and changes the upper-left pixel in those potential squares to blue. The provided code did correctly discern 2x2 squares of like-colored pixels, however, it didn't have the context that the pixels were just potential squares and that only the first pixel was targeted.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the Definition of "Internal":** The current logic identifies *all* pixels within a fully formed 2x2 azure square as "internal". We need to shift the focus to the *top-left* pixel of *potential* 2x2 azure squares.
2.  **Relax the 2x2 Requirement:** Instead of requiring all four pixels to be azure, we need to detect the *possibility* of a 2x2 azure square. This means we need to look for an azure pixel that *could* be the top-left corner of a 2x2 azure square, even if some of the other pixels in that potential square are not azure.
3.  **Update the Natural Language Program:**  We will rewrite the natural language program to reflect this refined understanding.
4.  **Metrics Gathering**
    We'll create a list of metrics, some we already have, but others that
    we may need.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including the already provided metrics and further observations:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   **Input:**
        ```
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 8 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 8 8 0
        0 0 0 0 0 8 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        ```

    *   **Expected Output:**
        ```
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 8 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 8 8 0
        0 0 0 0 1 8 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        ```

    *   **Transformed Output:** (from provided code)
        ```
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 0 0 0 0 0
        0 8 8 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 8 8 0
        0 0 0 0 0 8 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        ```
    * Pixels changed incorrectly to blue: (1,2), (4,4).
    * Pixels correctly identified as azure: all others.

    *   **Metrics:**
        *   match: False
        *   pixels\_off: 2
        *   size\_correct: True
        *   color\_palette\_correct: True
        *   correct\_pixel\_counts: False

*   **Example 2:**

    *   **Input:**
        ```
        0 0 0 0 8 8 0
        0 0 0 0 0 8 0
        0 0 8 0 0 0 0
        0 0 8 8 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 8 0 0
        0 0 0 8 8 0 0
        ```

    *   **Expected Output:**
        ```
        0 0 0 0 8 8 0
        0 0 0 0 1 8 0
        0 0 8 1 0 0 0
        0 0 8 8 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 1 8 0 0
        0 0 0 8 8 0 0
        ```

    *   **Transformed Output:** (from provided code)
        ```
        0 0 0 0 8 8 0
        0 0 0 0 0 8 0
        0 0 8 0 0 0 0
        0 0 8 8 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 0 0 0 8 0 0
        0 0 0 8 8 0 0
        ```
    * Pixels changed incorrectly to blue: None.
    * Pixels that should have changed to blue but didn't: (1,4), (2,3), (5,3).

    *   **Metrics:**
        *   match: False
        *   pixels\_off: 3
        *   size\_correct: True
        *   color\_palette\_correct: True
        *   correct\_pixel\_counts: False

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels represented by integers.
  - name: pixel
    type: integer
    description: Represents a color in the grid.
    values:
      0: white
      1: blue
      8: azure
  - name: potential_2x2_square
    type: concept
    description: A 2x2 square where the top-left pixel is azure, and the other three pixels *could* be azure.

actions:
  - name: identify_potential_square
    input: grid, pixel
    description: Checks if an azure pixel is the top-left corner of a potential 2x2 azure square.
  - name: change_color
    input: grid, pixel
    description: Changes the color of a pixel at a specific location.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the current pixel is azure (8).
3.  If the pixel is azure, **check** if it *could* be the top-left corner of a 2x2 azure square. This means checking if pixels at (row, col), (row+1, col), (row, col+1), and (row+1, col+1) *could* be azure, even if they do not currently have the value of 8. It is only required that (row, col) has value 8.
4. **If** a pixel *could* be the top-left corner of a 2x2 square, then **change** that pixel's color to blue (1).
5.  **Output** the modified grid.
