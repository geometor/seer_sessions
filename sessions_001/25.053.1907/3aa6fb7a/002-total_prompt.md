# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7EF8F23F6C20>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (matrix) of single-digit integers, representing colors. The primary color involved in the transformation is azure (8), with white (0) as the background.  The transformation seems to involve a specific interaction between existing azure pixels. A new color, blue (1), appears to be introduced based on this interaction.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents a colored grid.
  - object: pixel
    type: element
    property: color (represented by integer value)
  - object: azure_pixel
    type: pixel
    value: 8
    description:  Pixels with the value 8, representing the color azure.
  - object: white_pixel
    type: pixel
    value: 0
    description: Pixels with the value 0, representing white background.
  - object: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    value: 1
    description: Pixels with the value 1, representing the color blue, that are introduced in the output.
  - action: interaction
    type: adjacency
    trigger: azure_pixels
    condition: diagonally adjacent
    result: introduce blue_pixel
  - relationship: diagonal_adjacency
    between: azure_pixels
    result: determines placement of blue_pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Check** for diagonally adjacent pairs of azure pixels.
3.  **For each** diagonally adjacent pair of azure pixels, change the color of one of the azure pixel in the pair to blue (1).
4. **Preserve** all of the other pixels.
5.  **Output** the modified grid.

The core of the rule seems to be: "*If two azure pixels are diagonally adjacent, change one of the pixel to blue.*"

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
