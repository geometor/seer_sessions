Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies azure (8) regions but makes an incorrect assumption about which azure pixels to transform to blue (1). It only considers pixels with *four* azure neighbors as "internal".  The examples demonstrate that the rule is more nuanced: an azure pixel is considered "internal" if it is part of a contiguous 2x2 block of azure. This is important because, visually, it's how the "internal" pixels are determined. It's essential to re-evaluate not just individual neighbors, but also *their* neighbors to identify these 2x2 regions.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Internal Pixel Identification:** Instead of checking only direct neighbors, we need to check for the existence of a 2x2 azure square.
2.  **Iterate and Validate:** Apply the updated logic to all training examples and re-evaluate the mismatches.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of the provided test results, including my observations and the problems.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)
    *   **Expected Output Shape:** (7, 7)
    *   **Transformed Output Shape:** (7, 7)
    *   **Match:** False
    *   **Pixels Off:** 2
    *   **Size Correct:** True
    *   **Color Palette Correct:** True
    *   **Correct Pixel Counts:** False
    * **Problem:** fails to change appropriate pixels to blue

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input Shape:** (7, 7)
    *   **Expected Output Shape:** (7, 7)
    *   **Transformed Output Shape:** (7, 7)
    *   **Match:** False
    *   **Pixels Off:** 3
    *   **Size Correct:** True
    *   **Color Palette Correct:** True
    *   **Correct Pixel Counts:** False
        *   **Problem:** fails to change appropriate pixels to blue

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

```yaml
task: 008
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
    shape: contiguous regions
    property: can be internal or external
  - color: blue (1)
    shape: derived from internal azure pixels
actions:
  - identify: find all contiguous regions of azure
  - identify: find all *internal* azure pixels within each region, defined as part of 2x2 azure block
  - transform: change color of identified internal azure pixels to blue
  - preserve: keep all other pixels unchanged
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Internal Azure Pixels:** Within each azure region, identify "internal" azure pixels. An azure pixel is considered "internal" if it is part of a 2x2 square of adjacent azure pixels.
3.  **Transform Internal Pixels:** Change the color of all identified "internal" azure pixels to blue (1).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid (non-internal azure pixels and pixels of other colors) remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
