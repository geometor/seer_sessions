Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Target:** Locate the contiguous vertical stripe of '1' (blue) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Define the Region of Interest:** Consider the area immediately to the *right* of the blue stripe.
3. **Sub grid extraction.** extract a sub-grid from the input whose left edge is immediately to the right of the target. the dimensions match the output grid.
4.  **Transformation:** Within this region, change any '0' (white) pixel to '8' (azure). If the sub-grid pixel is not '0', it becomes '0'.
5.  **Output:** The transformed region is presented as the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
