# Example

**input:**
```
0 9 9 1 9 0 9
9 0 9 1 9 9 9
9 9 9 1 0 0 9
9 0 0 1 9 0 0
9 9 9 1 0 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7EF8F2113130>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7EF8F17DD6F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of different dimensions and values. The input grid seems to have a prominent vertical stripe of '1' (blue) and various arrangements of '9' (maroon) and '0' (white). The output grid is smaller and seems to focus on a specific area of the input, replacing some '0's (white) with '8's (azure) based on a relation with the blue stripe in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - values: [0-9]
      - dimensions: 5x7
    features:
      - description: "Contains a vertical blue stripe (value 1)."
      - colors: {0: white, 1: blue, 9: maroon}

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - values: [0, 8]
      - dimensions: 5x3
    features:
      - description: "Smaller grid derived from the input grid."
      - colors:  {0: white, 8: azure}

  - relationship: spatial
    description: "The output grid's azure pixels correspond to the location of white pixels immediately to the right of the blue stripe in the input."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target:** Locate the contiguous vertical stripe of '1' (blue) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Define the Region of Interest:** Consider the area immediately to the *right* of the blue stripe.
3. **Sub grid extraction.** extract a sub-grid from the input whose left edge is immediately to the right of the target. the dimensions match the output grid.
4.  **Transformation:** Within this region, change any '0' (white) pixel to '8' (azure). If the sub-grid pixel is not '0', it becomes '0'.
5.  **Output:** The transformed region is presented as the output grid.

Essentially, the transformation isolates a region of the input grid defined by a blue vertical stripe then modifies the values of the sub-grid to the right of this region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
