# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 1 9 0 0
9 0 9 1 9 9 9
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
0 0 0 1 9 9 9
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7EF8F235FA60>

**output:**
```
0 8 8
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7EF8F235FA00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a vertical line of blue (1) pixels and surrounding maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a cropped and color-modified version of the input, retaining only a portion related to the blue (1) pixels and changing some to azure (8). The dimensions also change, going from 7x5 to 3x5.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      width: 7
      height: 5
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      width: 3
      height: 5
  - object: blue_line
    type: vertical line
    color: blue (1)
    location: column 4 (in input_grid)
  - action: cropping
    description: Select a sub-region of the input grid
  - action: color_change
    description: Change the color of specific pixels
    details:
      - from: blue (1)
        to: azure (8)
  - relationship: output_grid is derived from input_grid
    transformation: cropping and color_change
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the blue line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. In this instance there is a single complete vertical line.
2.  **Crop the grid:** Extract a section of the input grid. The cropped section consists of three columns: The column to the left of the blue line and the two columns to the right. The height of the cropped section should be the height of the original section.
3.  **Change Colors**: Transform the pixels that were blue (1) to be azure(8). Leave all other pixel in the cropped section as color 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
