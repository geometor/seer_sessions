"""
1.  **Identify the blue line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. In this instance there is a single complete vertical line.
2.  **Crop the grid:** Extract a section of the input grid. The cropped section consists of three columns: The column to the left of the blue line and the two columns to the right. The height of the cropped section should be the height of the original section.
3.  **Change Colors**: Transform the pixels that were blue (1) to be azure(8). Leave all other pixel in the cropped section as color 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
