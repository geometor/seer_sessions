facts:
  - observation: "All input grids have 7 columns."
    type: input_grid_property
    property: width
    value: 7

  - observation: "All output grids have 3 columns."
    type: output_grid_property
    property: width
    value: 3

  - observation: "All input grids have a blue (1) pixel in the center column."
    type: input_grid_property
    property: center_column_value
    value: 1

  - observation: "The output grid is always a 3-column subgrid of the input grid, centered on the input's central column."
    type: grid_relationship
    property: subgrid_selection

  - observation: "Pixels horizontally adjacent to the central blue pixel in the input might change color in the output."
    type: transformation_rule
    property: recoloring
    condition: adjacency
    
  - observation: "The recoloring is NOT simply changing all central 1's to 8's. It seems to be replacing values to the left and right of center"
    type: transformation_rule
    property: center_value

  - observation: "The input row count is the same as the output row count"
    type: input_output
    property: dimensions
