The input grid seems to have a larger dimension than the output grid. There's a prominent vertical blue line (color 1) in the center of the input grid. The output grid seems to focus on the azure color (color 8), which replaces the blue in a specific pattern, other numbers are replaced by white(0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
