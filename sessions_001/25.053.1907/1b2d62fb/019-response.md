Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a larger dimension than the output grid. There's a prominent vertical blue line (color 1) in the center of the input grid. The output grid seems to focus on the azure color (color 8), which replaces the blue in a specific pattern, other numbers are replaced by white(0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x7
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - prominent_feature: vertical blue line (color 1) in the center column
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x3
      - values: integers (0, 8)
      - colors: white, azure
  - action: transformation
    description:  The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
    details: The central blue line is replaced with azure, and its height is preserved, everything else is white.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central column:** Find the vertical line of pixels with the color blue (value 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Resize:** The width is changed from the original to a new smaller width
3.  **Translate:** Create the output grid, copying the height of the input
4. **Recolor** Change the color of the vertical line from blue (1) to azure (8).
5. **Fill Surrounding:** Change the remaining of the output grid to white (0).
