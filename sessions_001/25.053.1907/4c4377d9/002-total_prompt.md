# Example

**input:**
```
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7EF8F235FA00>

**output:**
```
9 5 9 9
5 5 9 9
9 9 5 9
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The primary difference between the input and output grids is their dimensions and the arrangement of specific colored pixels. Specifically, the colors 9 (maroon) and 5 (gray) seem to be the key elements, with their relative positions changing between input and output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x4 (height x width)
    elements:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,3], [2,0], [2,2], [2,3]]
      - color: 5 (gray)
        positions: [[0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [2,1]]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x4 (height x width)
    elements:
      - color: 9 (maroon)
        positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [0,3], [2,0], [2,1], [3,0], [3,1], [3,3],[4,3], [5,0], [5,2], [5,3]]
      - color: 5 (gray)
        positions:  [[0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [2,2],[3,2], [4,0], [4,1], [5,1]]
  - observation:
      description: output duplicates and rearranges sections of input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on colors 9 (maroon) and 5 (gray) in the input grid.

2.  **Sub-grid Extraction:** Notice the input grid's repeating color patterns of 9 and 5.

3. **Duplication and Translation** The output appears to vertically stack shifted copies of the input rows.
    - copy input rows 0 and 1 and shift colors 9 and 5 to the right by one
    - copy input row 2 and shift colors 9 and 5 to the right by one
    - copy input row 0 and 1 and shift colors 9 and 5 to the right by one
    - copy input row 2 and shift colors 9 and 5 to the right by one

4.  **Output Construction:** Combine the modified rows to form the final output grid, with dimensions 6x4.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
