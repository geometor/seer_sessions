Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The primary difference between the input and output grids is their dimensions and the arrangement of specific colored pixels. Specifically, the colors 9 (maroon) and 5 (gray) seem to be the key elements, with their relative positions changing between input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
