            "text": "Okay, here's a natural language description of the transformation, taking into account the provided code and the results, especially the discrepancy in Example 2:\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify \"L\" shapes:** The program searches for \"L\"-shaped objects within the input grid. An \"L\" shape is defined as a 2x2 block of pixels of the same color where exactly three of the four pixels are the same color (azure/light blue, value 8).\n\n2.  **Locate Inside Corner:** For each identified \"L\" shape, the program determines the \"inside corner\". The inside corner is the single pixel within the 2x2 block that *does not* belong to the \"L\" shape (i.e. it is not azure). Note this definition and process is a more precise phrasing of that used in the comments in the provided python code.\n\n3.  **Recolor Inside Corner:** Change the color/value of the inside corner pixel to blue (value 1).\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not inside corners of azure \"L\" shapes retain their original color/value. The output grid is initially a copy of the input.\n\n**Analysis of the Discrepancy in Example 2, and how it led to the natural language program:**\n\nThe error in Example 2 reveals a subtle detail about what qualifies as the \"inside corner.\" The provided code does not make the assumption the that only the pixel adjacent to the 2x2 L will be converted. The updated description more precisely describes the definition implicit in the code, as well as clarifying the 2x2 nature of the definition.\n"
