Change the color of the pixel at each inside corner to blue (1)\n\nThe rule is to change the inside corner of each azure L-shaped object to blue. The previous solution attempted to find *all* L-shapes but then only modified the bottom-right one. This new example and description modifies all L-shapes.\n"
