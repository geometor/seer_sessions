Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:


```yaml
observations:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - colors:
    - present: [0, 8]
    - added: [1]
  - object_shapes:
      - "two separate L shaped objects of color 8"
  - relative_positions:
    - object_1: top-left
    - object_2: bottom-right, mirrored orientation of object_1
```


Here's my step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct "L"-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Object 1 Transformation**: The top-left "L" shape remains unchanged.

3.  **Object 2 Transformation**: In the bottom right "L" shaped object color: a single pixel in the corner of the "L", specifically the second to the rightmost and second to the bottommost azure, is changed to blue (value 1).

In essence, the transformation involves changing single corner azure pixel of the mirrored L object in the bottom-right of the input grid to the color blue.

```python
"""
The transformation identifies two "L"-shaped azure objects in the input grid. The top-left "L" shape remains unchanged. 
The bottom-right "L" shape has its corner pixel changed to blue (value 1).
"""

import numpy as np

def find_l_shapes(grid, color):
    """
    Finds L-shaped objects of a specific color in the grid.
    Returns a list of (corner_row, corner_col) tuples for each L-shape.
    """
    l_shapes = []
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows - 1):
        for c in range(cols - 1):
            if grid[r, c] == color:
                # Check for L shape (2x2 block with one missing corner)
                neighbors = [(r + 1, c), (r, c + 1), (r + 1, c + 1)]
                color_count = sum(1 for nr, nc in neighbors if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == color)
                if color_count == 2:
                    l_shapes.append((r, c))
    return l_shapes

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Find the L-shaped objects of color azure (8)
    l_shapes = find_l_shapes(input_grid, 8)
    
    # Find corner for color change
    if len(l_shapes) > 1:
        # Identify corner of the L-shape
        
        # Find the bottom-right L-shape
        max_row = -1
        bottom_right_l = None
        for r,c in l_shapes:
          if r >= max_row:
            max_row = r
            bottom_right_l = (r,c)

        # find the coordinates of the inside corner and make it blue
        corner_row, corner_col = bottom_right_l
        output_grid[corner_row+1, corner_col+1] = 1

    return output_grid
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- You may use code execution to examine the details of the task
- Document facts in a YAML block 
- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.  - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.

remember - your response here will be included in the history of the next
prompt as we move through the process. Be sure to include excellent information
for you future self to solve the task.
