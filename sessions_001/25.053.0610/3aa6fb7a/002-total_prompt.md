Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:


```yaml
observations:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - colors:
    - present: [0, 8]
    - added: [1]
  - object_shapes:
      - "two separate L shaped objects of color 8"
  - relative_positions:
    - object_1: top-left
    - object_2: bottom-right, mirrored orientation of object_1
```


Here's my step-by-step description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct "L"-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Object 1 Transformation**: The top-left "L" shape remains unchanged.

3.  **Object 2 Transformation**: In the bottom right "L" shaped object color: a single pixel in the corner of the "L", specifically the second to the rightmost and second to the bottommost azure, is changed to blue (value 1).

In essence, the transformation involves changing single corner azure pixel of the mirrored L object in the bottom-right of the input grid to the color blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
