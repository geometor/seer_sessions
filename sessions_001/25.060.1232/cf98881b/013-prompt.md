Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Find the Anchor:** Locate the top-leftmost yellow (color value 4) pixel within the input grid. This pixel serves as the anchor point for the transformation.
2.  **Attempt Subgrid Extraction:** Attempt to extract a 4x4 subgrid from the input grid. The top-left corner of this subgrid should be the location of the anchor pixel found in step 1.
3.  **Boundary Check:** Before extracting the subgrid, check if a 4x4 area starting at the anchor point would extend beyond the boundaries of the input grid.
4.  **Conditional Output:**
    *   If the 4x4 subgrid can be extracted without exceeding the input grid's boundaries, the output grid is this extracted subgrid.
    *   If extracting the 4x4 subgrid would exceed the boundaries, the output grid is an empty grid (0x0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
