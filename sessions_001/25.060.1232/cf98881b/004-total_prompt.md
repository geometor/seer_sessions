Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output).  The colors (represented by digits) in the output grid seem to be a selection of colors from the input grid, and the output grid appears to be a cropped and possibly filtered version of the input.  The transformation isn't a simple sub-region selection; some colors are entirely removed. The arrangement of the retained pixels may also have patterns or relationships within the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x14
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - observation: color_change
    description: "Some colors in the input grid are not present in the output grid."
  - observation: dimension_change
    description: "The output grid is smaller than the input grid (both width and height)."
  - observation: spatial_relationship
    description: "The output grid appears related to a section, or sections combined of the input grid, but it's not a direct sub-grid"
  - colors_present_input : [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]
  - colors_present_output: [0, 1, 4, 9]
  - color_eliminated: 2 #red

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The output only contains the colors yellow (4), white (0), blue (1) and maroon(9). Red (2) is removed from the input grid.
2.  **Locate Sub-grid:** find a region or sections of colors which create a relationship within the input
3.  **Extract Sub-grid:** derive the new, smaller grid by focusing on the position of colors from step 1.
4  **Construct Output Grid**: combine columns which result in the final output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
