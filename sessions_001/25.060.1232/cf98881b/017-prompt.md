Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** Focus on the top-left 4x4 section.
2. **Extract by coordinates:** Select all elements that form a sub-grid determined by rows 0-3 and columns 0-3.
3.  **Output the Sub-grid**: construct an output grid of size 4x4, mirroring
    the color and position of these pixels in the sub-grid
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a 4x4 array.
    output_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid.
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(4):
            # Copy the pixel value from the input grid to the output grid.
            output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
