Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grids are wider than the output grids.  The most obvious change is a significant reduction in width. The height remains the same. Colors seem to be mostly preserved, but their positions change. It appears that columns are being selectively removed. The color '2' (red) and most of the '0'(white) and some '9'(maroon) appear to be removed consistently. It looks like all the columns with '2'(red) are removed. Let's examine the factual relationships.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grids are wider than output grids."
  - observation: "Height of the grid remains constant."
  - observation: "Width of the grid is reduced."
  - observation: "Columns containing the color '2' (red) are removed."
  - observation: "Most of the color '0' (white) pixels seems to be removed along with columns containing '2'."
  - observation: "Color '4' (yellow) seems to be preserved consistently."
  - observation: "Color '1' (blue) is mostly preserved, though re-positioned due to column removal."
  - observation: "Color 9 (maroon) sometimes is preserved, sometimes not."
  - hypothesis: "Columns are the primary unit of transformation."
  - hypothesis: "Column removal is based on the presence of certain colors."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine each column** of the input grid.
2.  **Identify columns containing the color '2' (red).**
3. **Remove all columns from the grid that include 2(red)**.
4.  **Construct the output grid** by keeping all rows and the remaining columns, preserving their original order from left to right.
