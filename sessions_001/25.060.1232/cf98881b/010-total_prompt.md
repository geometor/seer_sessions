Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to focus on a subset of those colors and a specific region within the original grid. The spatial relationships and relative positions of colors seem important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: [rows, columns]
      - cells:
          type: pixel
          properties:
            - color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
            - position: [row_index, column_index]
  - type: subgrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: unknown
      - offset: unknown

actions:
  - type: extract_subgrid
    parameters:
      - start_row: unknown
      - start_col: unknown
      - end_row: unknown
      - end_col: unknown

relationships:
    - type: contains
      from: grid
      to: subgrid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Subgrid:** Locate a rectangular region within the input grid.  The top-left corner appears to correspond to the top-left most yellow (4) pixel.
2.  **Determine Subgrid Dimensions and Offset:** Calculate height and width of the selected area and its offset from upper-left corner of input.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid by copying the pixel values from the identified region of the input grid. The dimensions of output suggest selecting 4x4.
4. The subgrid appears to be defined by the bounding box that contains all instances of color '4' (yellow).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
