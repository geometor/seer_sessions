facts:
  - observation: "All output grids are 4x4."
  - observation: "The output grid consistently contains the colors 9 (maroon), 4 (yellow), and 0 (white)."
  - observation: "The arrangement of colors in the output grid (9, 4, 0, 4) is consistent across all examples."
  - observation: "The input grids vary in size, but they always seem to contain columns that could form the output grid."
  - observation: "Example 1 had red (2) pixels that were removed and columns extracted."
  - observation: "Example 2 had a red (2) pixel, but the output was the same as if there was no red."
  - observation: "Example 3 has no red (2) pixels."
  - observation: "The columns selected to construct the 4x4 grid are consistently the same columns, regardless of the input grid's width or the presence of other colors."
