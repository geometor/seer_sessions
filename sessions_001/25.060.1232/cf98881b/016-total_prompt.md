Okay, here's a report on my perception of the task, including a YAML block documenting facts and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The input grid seems to have several distinct regions of color, including yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), blue (1), and white(0). The output grid appears to be a compressed or summarized version of the input, retaining only some of the original colors, mainly yellow and maroon, with single occurrences of white and blue. It is apparent that a specific region from input is selected.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
task_name: train_3
input:
  grid_size: 4 x 15
  colors:
    yellow: "4"
    red: "2"
    maroon: "9"
    blue: "1"
    white: '0'
  objects:
    - object1:
      color: yellow
      shape: irregular
    - object2:
        color: maroon
        shape: irregular
    - object3:
        color: blue
        shape: irregular
    - object4:
       color: white
       shape: irregular
output:
  grid_size: 4 x 4
  colors:
    yellow: "4"
    maroon: "9"
    blue: "1"
    white: "0"
transformation_type: selection/compression and substitution
selection_coordinates:
 x_start: 0
 x_end: 3
 y_start: 0
 y_end: 3

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** Focus on the top-left 4x4 section.
2. **Extract by coordinates:** Select all elements that form a sub-grid determined by rows 0-3 and columns 0-3.
3.  **Output the Sub-grid**: construct an output grid of size 4x4, mirroring
    the color and position of these pixels in the sub-grid


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
