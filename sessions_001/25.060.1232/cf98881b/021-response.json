The input grid appears to be larger and contains more colors than the output grid. The output grid seems to be a compressed or extracted version of the input grid, retaining some of the original colors and shapes, but significantly reduced in size. The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), blue (1) and white (0).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
