Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids. The input grids are single-row grids with varying lengths, containing numerical digits (0-9). Each digit represents a color. The output grids have the same number of columns as their corresponding input grids but have a variable number of rows that appear to be derived from the input data and a specific pattern. The non-zero digits in the input seem to expand downwards, creating a triangular shape filled with the same digit. The '0' digits remain unchanged.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      dimensions: 1 x N  # Single row, N columns
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents a row of colored pixels.

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      dimensions: M x N  # M rows, N columns (same N as input)
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents an expanded version of the input grid.

  - relation: input_output_correspondence
    properties:
      column_count: same # Number of columns remains the same.
      row_count: varies  # Number of rows increases based on a rule.
      element_expansion: |
        Non-zero elements in the input expand downwards,
        forming a triangular/diagonal pattern of the same element.
      zero_preservation: '0' elements remain unchanged.

  - action: expansion
    description: Non-zero input digits expand downwards and rightward.
    details:
      pattern: triangular, diagonal fill
      color: same as the original digit
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid, which is a single row of digits.
2.  **Column Iteration:** For each column in the input grid:
    *   **Zero Check:** If the element in the current column is '0', copy it to all corresponding rows in the output grid (which initially doesn't exist, so it sets the dimensions of the column.
    *   **Non-Zero Expansion:** If the element is non-zero:
        *   Determine the expansion length. The first non-zero sequence expands by 1 row per element in the sequence.
        *   In the output grid, fill the cells downwards and rightwards, forming a triangle.  The number of rows added equals the count of contiguous non-zero digits starting at the current cell.
        *   For example, if the input is `[1, 1, 0]`, the '1's will expand to form:
          

```
          1 1 0
          1 1 0
          1 1 0
          ```


            If the sequence is `[2, 0]`, then the expansion will form:
            

```
            2 0
            2 0
            ```


            And if input is `[5, 5, 5, 0]` the output should be
            

```
            5 5 5 0
            5 5 5 0
            5 5 5 0
            5 5 5 0
            5 5 5 0
            ```


3.  **Output:** The resulting output grid is the transformed version of the input grid.

Essentially, each sequence of a non-zero colors is expanded into `n+1` rows, where n is the amount of pixels. The rest of the image is filled in with the zeros.
