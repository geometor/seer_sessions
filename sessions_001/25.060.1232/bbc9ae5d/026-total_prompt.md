Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Replicate:** Copy the entire input row to create a new, identical row directly below the original.
2.  **Reflect/Mirror with Shift:** Create a third row by reflecting/mirroring the input row. During the reflection, shift the color values of each pixel one position to the *right*, within the row. If a color would shift "off the end" of the row, wrap it around to the beginning of that same row.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with tripled height.
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((input_height * 3, input_width), dtype=int)

    # Replicate the input row.
    output_grid[0] = input_grid[0]
    output_grid[1] = input_grid[0]

    # Reflect/Mirror with shift.
    reflected_row = input_grid[0].copy()
    shifted_row = np.roll(reflected_row, 1)  # Use NumPy's roll for circular shift.
    output_grid[2] = shifted_row

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example, which involved replicating and reflecting a single row. However, the other training examples reveal that the transformation applies to *multiple* rows, not just the first one. The core concept of replication and circular-shifted reflection seems correct, but the code needs to iterate over all rows in the input grid. The strategy, therefore, is to modify the program and code to operate on each row of the input grid independently.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of the examples, the code's output, and my observations. I'll use a simplified representation of the grids for brevity.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: `[4]`
    *   Expected Output: `[4, 4, 4]`
    *   Actual Output: `[4, 4, 4]`
    *   Observation: The initial case works as designed.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 4], [3, 4], [4, 3]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[1, 2], [1, 2], [2, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]`
    *Observation: The code only processes the first row and doesn't replicate for other rows in the grid.

*    **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    Input: `[[5, 1, 8], [7, 8, 5]]`
    Expected: `[[5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 8], [8, 5, 1], [7, 8, 5], [7, 8, 5], [5, 7, 8]]`
    Actual Output: `[[5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 8], [8, 5, 1], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
     *Observation: Same issue. Only transforms the first row.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: row_wise_transformation
objects:
  - type: grid
    attributes:
      rows: multiple
      columns: variable
      elements: colors (integers 0-9)
actions:
  - name: replicate_row
    description: Duplicate each row.
  - name: reflect_and_shift
    description: >
      Create a mirrored copy of each row with a circular right shift of colors.
rules:
    - Each row in the input is processed independently.
    - For each row:
        1. Duplicate it immediately below.
        2. Create another row, mirroring the input, but shift each pixel's value.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate:** For each row in the input grid:
2.  **Replicate:** Copy the entire row to create a new, identical row directly below the original.
3.  **Reflect/Mirror with Shift:** Create a third row by reflecting/mirroring the original row. During the reflection, shift the color values of each pixel one position to the *right*, within that row. If a color would shift "off the end" of the row, wrap it around to the beginning of that same row.
4.  Place replicated and transformed rows directly below one another.

In essence, the original program was correct in its core logic of replication and shifted reflection but was incomplete as it only applied to a single row. This revised program explicitly states the row-wise iteration needed for grids with multiple rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
