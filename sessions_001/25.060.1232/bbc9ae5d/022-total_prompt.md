## train_4

**input:**
```
8 8 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x64 at 0x7CE41B8C38D0>

**output:**
```
8 8 8 8 0 0

8 8 8 8 8 8
```

Okay, I've reviewed the input and output grids for the `train_4` example. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 1x6 grid. The output is a 3x6 grid. The input grid consists of a sequence of colored pixels: four azure (8) pixels followed by two white (0) pixels. The output grid expands on this. The azure pixels appear to be replicated downwards, while the white pixels have a more complex behavior, with a mixture of replication and adding additional azure.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 1x6
      output: 3x6
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        initial_count: 4
        final_count: 9 # updated after visualization
        positions:
          input:  [0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [0,3]
          output: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2], [2,3], [2,4]]
      - color: white (0)
        initial_count: 2
        final_count: 3 # updated
        positions:
          input: [0,4], [0,5]
          output:  [[0,4], [0,5],[1,5]]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
        color: integer (0-9)

actions:
  - type: replication
    description: The input grid is replicated, with modifications.
    details:  Azure pixels extend downwards.  White pixels also replicate with some change.

relationships:
  - input grid elements map to output grid elements
  - azure expands downwards
  - white exhibits complex expansion.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the 1x6 input grid.

2.  **Azure Replication:** The first four azure pixels are replicated vertically to create three rows in total. The last azure pixel from row 1 column 4 is replicated such to create a column of azure.

3. **White Replication**: The first white is replicated once. Then, The final white pixel in the sequence (at position [0,5] in the input) stays in the first row and is replicated one time vertically in column 5.

In simpler terms, treat the first four azure pixels as one block and replicate it vertically three times. Copy the first white square. Copy the last white, extend the second azure one down.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
