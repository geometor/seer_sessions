Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations, a YAML block summarizing the facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing numerical values that represent colors. The input grid is a single row, while the output grid is a rectangle. The blue (1) pixels in the input seem to expand both horizontally and vertically to form a larger, connected blue region in the output. The white (0) pixels remain unchanged. The shape expands.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, columns]
      values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: integer (0 or 1 in this example)
          position: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: expand_blue_region
    input: grid
    output: grid
    description:  Expands the contiguous region of blue pixels.

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    description: The output grid is a transformation of the input grid.
  - type: spatial
    description:  Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid, with adjacency being relevant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Region:** Locate the contiguous region of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Expand Rows:** Extend the grid downwards, adding a single pixel for each white pixel.
3.  **Extend Blue Area** For each new row added, extend the blue area to have the same number of pixels as there are blue pixels in the first row.
4  **Final Output:** The output grid is the original input grid plus the expanded blue region.

Essentially the blue region creates an object and expands downwards based on the initial shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
