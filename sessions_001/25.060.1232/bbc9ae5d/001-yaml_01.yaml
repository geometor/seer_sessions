  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      dimensions: M x N  # M rows, N columns (same N as input)
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents an expanded version of the input grid.

  - relation: input_output_correspondence
    properties:
      column_count: same # Number of columns remains the same.
      row_count: varies  # Number of rows increases based on a rule.
      element_expansion: |
        Non-zero elements in the input expand downwards,
        forming a triangular/diagonal pattern of the same element.
      zero_preservation: '0' elements remain unchanged.

  - action: expansion
    description: Non-zero input digits expand downwards and rightward.
    details:
      pattern: triangular, diagonal fill
      color: same as the original digit
