Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:
1. Replicate the first four azure (8) pixels vertically to create three rows.
2. Replicate the two white (0) pixels. Add an azure pixel below the last azure.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid based on the input grid's dimensions.
    # The output grid will be 3x6.
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, input_width), dtype=int)

    # Replicate the first four azure pixels vertically.
    for i in range(4):
        output_grid[0:3, i] = input_grid[0, i]

    # Copy first white down once
    output_grid[0,4] = input_grid[0,4]

    # Place two last azure and last white
    output_grid[0,5] = input_grid[0,5]
    output_grid[1,5] = input_grid[0,5]
    output_grid[2,4] = input_grid[0,3]


    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
