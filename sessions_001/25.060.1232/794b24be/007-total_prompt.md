Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Examine the input grid.
2.  If there are any non-zero pixels in the input grid:
    *   Create an output grid of the same dimensions, filled entirely with white (0) pixels.
    *   Place a single red (2) pixel in the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.
3.  If there are NO non-zero pixels in the input grid:
    *   The output grid is identical to the input grid (all white/0).

Essentially, regardless of *how many* non-zero pixels are present, or their original colors, the output *always* has a single red pixel at (0,0) if *any* non-zero pixels existed, and is all white otherwise. The original color and location of the input non-zero pixel(s) are irrelevant.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but filled with 0s (white).
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Check if there are any non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    if np.any(input_grid):
        # If any non-zero pixels exist, set the top-left pixel to red (2).
        output_grid[0, 0] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
