Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a grid by placing a two-pixel red object at the top-left corner (0,0) and (0,1) 
if any blue pixels are present in the input grid. White pixels remain unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.
    """
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)  # Initialize output grid with zeros (white)

    # Check for the presence of any blue pixels
    blue_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 1)
    
    if len(blue_pixels) > 0:  # If any blue pixels are found
        # Create the red object at the specified positions
        output_grid[0, 0] = 2  # Red pixel at (0, 0)
        output_grid[0, 1] = 2  # Red pixel at (0, 1)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
