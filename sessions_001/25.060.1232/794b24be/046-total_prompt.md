Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transform the input grid to the output grid based on the following rule:
All pixels in the top row of the input grid are changed to red (2) in the output grid.
All pixels not in the top row remain white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid, but with all zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the top row (row 0)
    for j in range(cols):
        # Change all pixels in the top row to red (2)
        output_grid[0, j] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single training example, and it appears the rule derived from that example is too specific. The rule only applies to the first row and sets it to red.  The other examples show that this is incorrect. We need to generalize the rule to account for all training examples. The core issue seems to be that the initial hypothesis was overly simplistic and didn't capture the actual transformation pattern.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all input-output pairs in the training set to identify the *common* transformation rule.
2. **Identify Objects and Actions:** Determine the relevant objects (regions, shapes, colors), their attributes, and how they are being manipulated.
3. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately describe the observed transformation in a general way that applies to all examples.
4. **Test:** Test the updated NL Program mentally

**Metrics and Observations:**

To get more precise metrics and help identify the actual rule, let's manually inspect each of the pairs

**Example 1:**

Input:

```
[[0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
```

Output:

```
[[2 2 2 2 2]
 [0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0]]
```

- **Observation:** The top row becomes red.

**Example 2:**

Input:

```
[[0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0]]
```

Output:

```
[[2 2 2 2]
 [0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0]]
```

- **Observation:** The top row becomes red.

**Example 3:**

Input:

```
[[0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]]
```

Output:

```
[[2 2 2]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]]
```

- **Observation:** The top row becomes red.

**Test Result Analysis:**

All tests pass, which mean that this rule fits all available examples.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the initial state of the grid.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the transformed state of the grid.
  - name: top_row
    type: row
    description: the first row of the grid.
properties:
  - name: color
    values:
      - 0: white
      - 2: red
actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: top_row
    target: all pixels
    new_value: red
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Identify the top row of the input grid.
2.  Change the color of all pixels in the top row to red.
3. All other pixels not in the top row should stay white.
4.  The output grid is the result of this transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
