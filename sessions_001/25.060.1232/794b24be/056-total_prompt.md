**input:**
```
1 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE423308F50>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The input grid contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid contains red (2) and white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to involve replacing blue pixels with red ones and some white pixels with others based on some logic.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red

actions:
  - type: replace
    agent: program
    target: input_grid pixels
    condition: "input value equals 1 (blue)"
    replacement: 2 (red)

  - type: replace
    agent: program
    target: input_grid pixels
    condition: "input value equals 0 (white), specific locations in the input grid"
    replacement: "check the location of the 1s, replace the bounding box that includes all 1s by 2"
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "input and output grids have the same dimensions."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with a value of 1 (blue).
2.  **Replace Blue with Red**: Change the value of all identified blue pixels (1) to 2 (red).
3.  **Bounding box:** Find the smallest rectangle that encompasses all of the 1s (blue).
4. **Replace Top Row** Replace the values in the output grid within this rectangle with 2 in the first row.
5.  **Retain Other Whites:** All other white pixels (0) in the input grid remain white (0) in the output grid.

Essentially, the transformation replaces all blue pixels with red, finds the minimum bounding box containing all blue cells, and the top row in the result box is assigned red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
