"""
1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  White Pixels: If a pixel is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
3.  Blue Pixels - Top Row Contiguous Blocks: If a pixel is blue (1) and is located
    in the top row (row index 0), and part of the block is 2 or more pixels,
    change the color of the entire block to red(2).
4.  Blue Pixels - Single Pixel 2nd or 3rd Row: If a blue pixel is in the second
    or third row (row index 1 or 2) and part of a contiguous block, change the
    color to white (0).
5.  Blue Pixels - Contiguous Blocks not Top Row: If a blue pixel is not in the
    top row and part of the block is 2 or more pixels, change the color of the
    entire block to red(2).
6.  Blue Pixel - Single: Change any other single blue cell to red (2)
7.  Output: The output grid is created by applying these transformations.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, but the test results across multiple examples reveal some inaccuracies. The code correctly handles white pixels and identifies contiguous blocks of blue pixels. However, it incorrectly handles single blue pixels in the second or third row that were supposed to be red.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will use code execution to calculate specific properties of each input/output pair, such as the number of blue pixels, the size of contiguous blocks, and the row indices of single pixels.
2.  **Refine Transformation Rules:** Based on the analysis, I will identify the specific conditions under which the current code fails and update the natural language program to handle each case accurately.
3.  **YAML Documentation:** I'll create a YAML block summarizing the observations, focusing on objects (pixels, blocks), their properties (color, position, contiguity), and the transformations applied.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's an analysis of each example, including metrics gathered using code execution, to better describe the transformation:

```python

    white_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 0)
    white_pixels_output = np.sum(output_grid == 0)
    
    blue_blocks_input = get_contiguous_blocks(input_grid, 1)
    
    single_blue_pixels = []

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **White Pixels:** If a pixel is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
2.  **Blue Pixels:** If a pixel is blue (1), it changes to red(2).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
