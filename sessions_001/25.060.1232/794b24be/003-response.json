The input grid contains a single blue pixel (value 1) at position (1,0) and the rest are white pixels (value 0). The output grid contains a single red pixel (value 2) at (0,0), and the rest are white (value 0). The primary change seems to be the color and position of the single non-zero pixel. The blue pixel seems to move to the top left and becomes red.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
