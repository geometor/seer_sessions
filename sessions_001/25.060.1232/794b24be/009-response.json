The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains 0s (white) and 2s (red). The transformation seems to involve a change in color and value based on the input. The black borders in the visual examples seem to be for visual display only and not part of the data.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
