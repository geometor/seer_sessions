The input grid contains '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels. The output grid contains '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain blue pixels with red pixels based on their location.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For example, it blue has 2 pixels, create the sequence: (0,0), (0,1)\n4. **Change** the color of the identified pixels in that sequence to Red\n5.
