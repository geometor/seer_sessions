**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B8FC0D0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
*   The input grid contains values 0 and 1, representing white and blue pixels, respectively.
*   The output grid contains values 0 and 2, representing white and red pixels, respectively.
*   The spatial arrangement of the '0' (white) pixels remains identical between the input and output.
*    The transformation seems to involve changing specific colored, non-zero, non-white pixels based on their color, with context.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are 3x3.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      input_colors: [white, blue]
      output_colors: [white, red]
      input_values: [0, 1]
      output_values: [0, 2]
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        blue: 1
        red: 2
  - relationship: "White pixels (0) in the input remain white pixels (0) in the output."
  - transformation: "Blue pixels (1) in the top row of the input are converted to red pixels (2) in the output."
  - transformation: "The blue pixel (1) in the middle of the grid that forms part of a contiguous 2x1 shape becomes red(2)."
  - transformation: "All other blue pixels (1) are converted to white pixels (0)."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  If a pixel is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
3.  If a pixel is blue (1), then:
    - If any blue pixel on the top row, that forms a contiguous group of 2 or more changes that whole group to red
    - change any single blue cell in the second or third row to white
    - change any other blue cell to red
4. Output will be created with changes to cells with corresponding coordinates.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
