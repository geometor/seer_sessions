      output_objects:
         - object_1: {type: grid, dimensions: 5x5, colors: [blue, white], description: "Third row blue, rest white"}
      transformation: "Identify a horizontal line in input by finding the row where all non-white pixels have same color. Recreate single color horizontal line in output, all other pixels are white."
