facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are 3x3.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      input_colors: [white, blue]
      output_colors: [white, red]
      input_values: [0, 1]
      output_values: [0, 2]
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        blue: 1
        red: 2
  - relationship: "White pixels (0) in the input remain white pixels (0) in the output."
  - transformation: "Blue pixels (1) in the top row of the input are converted to red pixels (2) in the output."
  - transformation: "The blue pixel (1) in the middle of the grid that forms part of a contiguous 2x1 shape becomes red(2)."
  - transformation: "All other blue pixels (1) are converted to white pixels (0)."
