            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to all cases. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of the rule. The initial program focused solely on the row index (specifically, row 0) for changing blue pixels. The new examples show that the surrounding context and the structure of the input grids may contribute to output. We need a more nuanced approach.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Analyze results, and verify that the code did what it was supposed to do:** We will review that the errors are not related to problems with the color map or other functions, but that the code did precisely what it was intended.\n2.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll meticulously examine each input-output pair, focusing on:\n    *   The spatial relationships between blue pixels and other colors.\n    *   Checking the row and column.\n    *   Checking for contiguities of objects.\n3.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will formulate a more comprehensive hypothesis about the transformation rule, considering spatial context and object interactions, and document the facts using YAML.\n4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** I'll translate the refined hypothesis into a precise natural language program.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis:**\nHere I start with the train pairs.\n\n*Example 1 Analysis*\n```tool_code\ninput = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]])\nexpected = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]])\npredicted = np.array([[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]])\nprint(np.array_equal(expected,predicted))\nprint(expected.shape)\nprint(predicted.shape)\n```"
