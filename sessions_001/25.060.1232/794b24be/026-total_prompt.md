**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE4233275D0>

**output:**
```

Okay, I'm ready to analyze this example pair and provide my observations.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The primary change seems to be the color and/or value, and position of a single non-zero cell, while the rest of the grid remains filled with zeros (white).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: cells
    properties:
      - name: color
        values: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red

  - type: cell
    properties:
      - name: value
        type: integer
      - name: color #derived from value
        type: string
      - name: position
        type: coordinates (row, col)

actions:
  - name: change_color_and_value
    description: The value and, therefore, color of a single cell changes.
  - name: change_position
    description: The position of non zero value moves.

relationships:
  - relationship: cell_belongs_to_grid
    description: Each cell is a part of the grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-zero cell:** In the input grid, locate the cell that has a value other than 0.
2.  **Change color and value and move:** Change the color(value) to a different one, in this case if the value is 1 the next value is 2. Move this value to the top-left. All other values are set to 0.
3.  **Update the grid**: all other positions on the grid are 0.

In short, the transformation involves taking any non zero value on input and replacing it with a new non-zero value at a specific position in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
