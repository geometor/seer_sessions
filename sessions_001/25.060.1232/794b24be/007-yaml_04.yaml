observations:
  - category: "Object Persistence"
    description: "Non-zero pixels in the input do not persist in the output in their original form or location."
  - category: "Object Creation"
    description: "A new red pixel (value 2) is consistently created at position (0,0) in the output grid, *if* the input contains any non-zero pixels."
  - category: "Conditional Rule"
    description: "The transformation is conditional on the presence of any non-zero pixel in the input grid."
  - category: "Grid Dimensions"
    description: "The output grid always maintains the same dimensions as the input grid."
  - category: "Pixel Values"
    description: "Input grids contain pixels with values 0 and potentially other values (1-9). Output grids contain only 0 and potentially a single 2."
  - category: input_output_relationship
    input_has_non_zero: "Output has a red pixel at (0,0)"
    input_is_all_zero: "Output is identical to input (all zeros)."
