Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains 0s (white) and 2s (red). The transformation seems to involve a change in color and value based on the input. The black borders in the visual examples seem to be for visual display only and not part of the data.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [0, 1] # input
          mapping: {0: white, 1: blue}
      - color:
          values: [0, 2] # output
          mapping: {0: white, 2: red}

actions:
  - type: change_color
    input_value: 1
    output_value: 2
  - type: keep_color
    input_value: 0
    output_value: 0

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: The positions of the 0s in the output appear to mirror the locations of the input grid, at least in terms of rows and columns, preserving non-blue cells.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 grid (the input).
2.  **Iteration:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   If a pixel's value is 1 (blue), change its value to 2 (red).
    *   If a pixel's value is 0 (white), keep its value as 0 (white).
4. **Output:** preserve the spatial locations. The resulting grid is the output.

In simpler terms: Replace all blue pixels with red pixels, keeping white pixels unchanged. The core concept is a direct color substitution based on the initial pixel value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
