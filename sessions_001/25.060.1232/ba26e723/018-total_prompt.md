```python
"""
Replace specific yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels based on their horizontal neighbors.  If a yellow pixel has yellow neighbors on both sides (left and right), it changes to magenta. If a yellow pixel has white neighbors on both sides, it changes to magenta. Otherwise, the pixel remains unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's an analysis of the provided code, training results, and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a rule based on horizontal neighbors, changing yellow pixels to magenta if flanked by either yellow or white pixels. The test results indicate this rule is partially correct but doesn't capture the full transformation logic. Specifically, it appears to perform correctly on the first example, and less well on the others. We need to revisit all the training examples, compare the input and output grids element-wise, and identify cases where the current rule fails. This iterative refinement is essential. The issue is that all neighbor pixels are considered. However, the rule only applies to the top left pattern.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

To thoroughly analyze the examples, I'll use a simple approach: I will look for differences between the output grid and result grid and determine if the provided code accounts for the change.

Here is the summary of all three example pairs:

*   **Example 1:** The result matches the expected output. The code correctly changes the yellow pixels surrounded by white or yellow to magenta.
*   **Example 2:** The code fails here. In input, at `[0,1]` there is a yellow pixel that gets changed to magenta and this is the case. In the input, at `[1,1]` there is a yellow pixel that does *not* change. So, we know that the rule only applies to the pixels in the top row.
*  **Example 3:** The code changes the yellow pixel in `[0,4]` which is correct. However, there is a yellow pixel in `[2,4]` that does not change. So, we know that the rule only applies to the pixels in the top row.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
task: color_replacement_based_on_top_row
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, magenta, orange, azure, maroon, gray]
      dimensions: variable
      pixel_values: integers (0-9)

rules:
    - description: "Conditional color change of yellow pixels in only the top row."
      condition:
        - "Yellow pixel has yellow neighbors on both sides (left and right)."
        - "OR Yellow pixel has white neighbors on both sides."
      action: "Change the yellow pixel to magenta."
    - description: "Ignore any pixel not in the first (top) row."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate:** Examine only the first row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify:** Within the first row, identify yellow pixels.
3.  **Check Neighbors:** For each yellow pixel in the top row:
    *   Check the pixel immediately to its left.
    *   Check the pixel immediately to its right.
4.  **Conditional Change:**
    *   If both neighboring pixels are yellow, change the identified yellow pixel to magenta.
    *   If both neighboring pixels are white, change the identified yellow pixel to magenta.
5.  **Other Rows:** Do not make any modifications to pixels in rows other than the first row.
6. **Output** Return a new grid with any changes.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
