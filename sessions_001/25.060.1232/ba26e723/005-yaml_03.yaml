observations:
  - object: yellow_frames
    description: Rectangular frames composed of yellow (4) pixels.  These always seem to define the overall boundary and smaller internal regions.
    properties:
      - color: yellow
      - shape: rectangle
      - role:  Defines areas where corners are significant.
      - dimensions: usually 3x3 or greater

  - object: white_pixels
    description:  Pixels that can be potential targets for transformation.
    properties:
      - color: white
      - initial_state: 0
      - potential_change:  May change to magenta (6) if located at the corner position of the yellow frames.

  - object: corner_positions
    description: Locations considered to be corners of a 3x3 region as defined by areas created with yellow pixels.
    properties:
      - change_color: The white pixels at these positions are changed to magenta.
      - adjacent_to: yellow area

actions:
  - action: change_color
    description: Change the color of white pixels at corner positions to magenta.
    trigger: Identification of a corner position relative to a yellow frame or yellow region.
    before: 0
    after: 6
