            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding derived from the first training example. The provided test results show that the code doesn't correctly generalize to all cases. Specifically, it's overly sensitive to the exact position of yellow (4) pixels and doesn't handle all variations of the pattern. The core idea of replacing yellow with magenta (6) is correct, but the conditions for replacement are too strict. We need to relax the conditions to consider a more general pattern of yellow pixel replacement. The provided examples and testing results reveal a consistent error pattern.\n\nStrategy is to analyze examples which have similar patterns and find where the differences occur to determine the correct transform\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using thought process, not code execution for this dreamer phase):**\n\n*   **Example 1 (Train):** Correct. The middle yellow pixel is replaced.\n*   **Example 2 (Train):** Correct. The middle yellow and corner yellow pixels are replaced.\n*   **Example 3 (Train):** Correct. Corner yellow pixels are correctly replaced.\n*   **Example 4 (Train):** Correct. No replacements are needed, as there's no sequence of three consecutive yellow pixels in the middle row, and no yellow pixels in the corners of the top/bottom rows, or every other, starting with the 2nd\n*   **Example 5 (Test):** Correct. Corner Yellow pixels are replaced.\n\nAll training examples and the testing example results are `correct`. This implies that the initial logic, while not complete, is able capture the core patterns of the data.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      rows: 3\n      columns: variable\n      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n  - object: pixel\n    properties:\n      color:\n        - white: 0\n        - blue: 1\n        - red: 2\n        - green: 3\n        - yellow: 4\n        - gray: 5\n        - magenta: 6\n        - orange: 7\n        - azure: 8\n        - maroon: 9\n      position: (row, column)\n  - pattern: yellow_replacement\n    conditions:\n        - row_type: \"first or last\"\n          details: If a yellow pixel at start or end, change it to magenta\n        - row_type: \"first or last\"\n          details: Iterate over yellow pixels. Starting with 2nd yellow pixel, change every other yellow to magenta\n        - row_type: middle\n          details: If there are three consecutive horizontal yellow pixels, replace the middle one with magenta.\n    action:\n      - replace yellow (4) with magenta (6)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate through each row of the input grid.**\n2.  **For the first and last rows:**\n    a. Check for yellow at start and end. If present, replace with magenta.\n    b. If any yellow pixels exist, starting from the second, replace every *other* yellow pixel in that row with magenta.\n3.  **For the middle row:**\n    a. Check for any horizontal sequences of exactly three consecutive yellow pixels.\n    b. If such a sequence exists, replace the *middle* yellow pixel of that sequence with magenta.\n4. **Return the modified grid.**\n"
