**input:**

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 3x10 grids (2D arrays).
*   **Colors:** The input grid primarily uses yellow (4) and white (0). The output introduces magenta (6) while retaining yellow and white.
*   **Pattern:**  There's a clear alternating pattern in the input, both horizontally and vertically. The output seems to disrupt this pattern with the introduction of magenta. The magenta appears at locations corresponding to the corners of 2x2 yellow squares, and is inserted into the corners of 3x3 squares.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x10
      type: 2D array
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
      - value: 6
        color: magenta
  - observation: input_alternating_pattern
    description: Yellow and white alternate in both rows and columns in the input grid.
  - observation: output_magenta_placement
    description: Magenta appears at the intersection of every other yellow and every other white along the horizontal, and every other row.
  - action: color_substitution
    description: Some white cells are replaced with magenta cells based on their position relative to yellow cells.
  - relationship: magenta_near_yellow
    description:  Magenta pixels are placed at corners of the virtual 3x3 squares, defined by a pattern of length three.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Potential Magenta Locations:** Examine the grid. Starting from the top-left, view the grid in terms of 3x3 squares, but only place a magenta in the corners, skipping to every other location along the x axis and y axis.
2.  **Substitute Color:** If a cell at one of these locations is white (0), replace it with magenta (6).
3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other cells, the non-corner-intersecting white cells (0) and all the original yellow (4), remain unchanged.

In simpler terms, the rule identifies specific white cells, located at the corners defined by a 3x3 grid, and changes them to magenta. The 3x3 squares don't exist in the input data, but the corners are created using the pattern and shape of the layout of yellow pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
