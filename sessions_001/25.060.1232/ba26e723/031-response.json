            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited observation (the first training example). It correctly identified a pattern (inserting a '6' before columns with yellow pixels adjacent to an all-white column) but failed to generalize to other scenarios present in the subsequent training examples. The primary issue is that the code prepends 6 on only the location of yellow pixel, not the whole column. Also the code only check columns, but the rule may apply to rows.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine all input/output pairs, focusing on the discrepancies between the `transform` function's output and the expected output.\n2.  **Identify missed patterns:** Determine what rules or patterns the initial code *didn't* account for.\n3. **Object Properties:** Record the properties of the input/output pairs, including rows, columns, height, width, and colors.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to incorporate the newly discovered rules, making it more comprehensive.\n5.  **Prepare for Code Update:** Use insights gathered to create a structured YAML document summarizing object properties, actions, and conditions.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo accurately assess the examples, I need to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `transform` function. I'll use a simple representation to display this:\n*   \"Correct\" if the transformed output matches the expected output.\n* \"Incorrect\" if there's a mismatch\n\nI'll record this in the YAML along with object properties:\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 0\n    input_grid_dims: [3, 5]\n    output_grid_dims: [3, 5]\n    input_colors: [0, 4]\n    output_colors: [0, 4, 6]\n    transform_result: Incorrect\n    verified_rule: \"Insert 6 before yellow in columns next to all white columns.\"\n\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_grid_dims: [5, 5]\n    output_grid_dims: [5, 5]\n    input_colors: [0, 4]\n    output_colors: [0, 4, 6]\n    transform_result: Incorrect\n    verified_rule: \"Insert 6 before yellow in columns next to all white columns.\"\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_grid_dims: [7, 9]\n    output_grid_dims: [7, 9]\n    input_colors: [0, 4]\n    output_colors: [0, 4, 6]\n    transform_result: Incorrect\n    verified_rule: \"Insert 6 before yellow in columns next to all white columns.\"\n```\n\n**YAML Document (Facts)**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)\n      - cells: contain integer values representing colors\n      - colors_present: [0 (white), 4 (yellow), 6 (magenta)]\n    actions:\n      - \"Insert: The digit '6' (magenta) is inserted into the grid.\"\n      - \"Conditional Placement: The insertion is dependent on the presence of color 4 (yellow) and color 0(white).\"\n\n  - pattern: column_adjacency\n    properties:\n      - \"A column containing only color 0 (white) is immediately to the left of a column containing color 4 (yellow).\"\n    actions:\n        - \"Insert 6 before a yellow-containing column\"\n\n  - pattern: column_transformation\n    properties:\n      - \"all cells of magenta color is prepended to the whole column\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nHere's the revised natural language program:\n\n1.  **Scan Columns:** Iterate through each column of the input grid, starting from the second column (index 1).\n2.  **Check Left Neighbor:** For each column, check if the column immediately to its left contains *only* white pixels (color 0).\n3.  **Check Current Column:** If the left neighboring column is all white, examine the current column.\n4.  **Yellow Presence:** If the current column contains at least one yellow pixel (color 4).\n5.  **Insert Magenta:** Insert a magenta pixel (6) in every row, before existing pixels on the column being checked.\n\nThe program is: *If a column contains a yellow pixel and that column is next to the all-white column on the left, prepend magenta pixels to the whole yellow-containing column.*\n"
