The input grid consists of alternating yellow (4) and white (0) pixels, with a solid horizontal line of yellow pixels in the middle. The output grid introduces magenta (6) pixels, replacing some of the yellow pixels. The white pixels mostly remain unchanged. The pattern of magenta pixels appears to be related to the position of the yellow pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
