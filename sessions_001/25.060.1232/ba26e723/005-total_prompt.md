Previous Code:
```python
"""
The rule identifies specific white cells, located at the corners defined by a 3x3 grid, and changes them to magenta. The 3x3 squares don't exist in the input data, but the corners are created using the pattern and shape of the layout of yellow pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by changing specific white cells to magenta based on their position.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the grid, checking for potential magenta locations.
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check if the current cell is white (0).
            if output_grid[i, j] == 0:
                # check if location aligns with the "corner" of 3x3 square
                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:
                    output_grid[i,j] = 6

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
