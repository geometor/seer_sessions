            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code focuses on identifying white regions and changing the color of yellow pixels that form the external corners of these regions to magenta. This approach works for the first example but fails on the others. The core issue is that the code's definition of \"external corner\" is too restrictive and specific to the structure of the first example. It doesn't generalize well to other configurations of white and yellow pixels. The strategy for resolving errors is to:\n\n1.  **Broaden the definition of \"corner\":** Instead of focusing solely on 2x2 white squares, consider all adjacent white pixels when determining if a yellow pixel is a corner.\n2.  **Consider all surrounding pixels:** The adjacency needs to be checked more comprehensively.\n3.  **Revisit the assumptions:** We need a more robust concept. It seems we're not dealing with \"external corners\" of white regions, but rather yellow pixels with a *specific* relationship to adjacent white pixels, regardless of the larger white region's shape.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the patterns, let's analyze each example's input, output, and the result produced by the code. I'll focus on the discrepancies.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct) The code correctly identifies the yellow pixels that are \"external corners\" of the white region and changes their color to magenta.\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: A single horizontal line of white pixels with yellow pixels at both ends.\n    *   Expected Output: The yellow pixels should be magenta.\n    *   Code Result: The yellow pixels remain yellow.\n    *   Analysis: The code's 2x2 white square check fails here, as there are no 2x2 white squares. The yellow pixels *are* adjacent to white pixels.\n\n*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: A vertical line of white pixels with yellow pixels at both ends.\n    *   Expected Output: The yellow pixels should be magenta.\n    *   Code Result: The yellow pixels remain yellow.\n    *   Analysis: Same issue as Example 2. The 2x2 check is too restrictive.\n\n*   **Example 4:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: A 2x2 white square with yellow pixels diagonally adjacent.\n    *   Expected output: Yellow pixels are magenta.\n    *   Code Result: Yellow pixels remain yellow.\n    *   Analysis: Same issue as Example 2 & 3. The 2x2 check is too restrictive, and fails because now we have a 2x2 *white* square.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: white_pixel\n    color: white\n    value: 0\n    properties:\n      - can form regions\n  - name: yellow_pixel\n    color: yellow\n    value: 4\n    properties:\n      - can be transformed to magenta\n  - name: magenta_pixel\n      color: magenta\n      value: 6\n      properties:\n        - result of transformation\n\nactions:\n  - name: transform\n    input: yellow_pixel\n    condition: adjacent to at least one white pixel, and not part of a contiguous 2x2 yellow area\n    output: magenta_pixel\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify all white pixels (value 0) and yellow pixels (value 4).**\n2.  **For each yellow pixel:**\n    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    *   If *any* of the neighbors are white, change the yellow pixel to magenta (value 6).\n    *   However, if the yellow pixel is part of a 2x2 block of ONLY yellow pixels, do not transform it.\n\nThe key improvement here is simplifying the adjacency rule. We're no longer looking for \"external corners\" of large white regions. Instead, *any* yellow pixel next to *any* white pixel becomes magenta, except when the yellow pixel is inside a 2x2 yellow island.\n"
