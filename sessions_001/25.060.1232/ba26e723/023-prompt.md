Previous Code:
```python
"""
Replaces specific yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels in a grid. The replacement pattern depends on the position of yellow pixels.
- Corner yellow pixels in the first and third rows are changed to magenta.
- Every other yellow pixel in the first and third rows is changed to magenta.
- Yellow pixels in the second row with yellow neighbors on both sides are changed to magenta.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
