            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, structured as requested:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers, representing colors.  The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The primary colors involved appear to be yellow (4), white (0), and magenta (6). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of some yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels, and vice-versa, while white pixels remain unchanged. The pattern of replacement appears related to the position and arrangement of the yellow and white pixels. Specifically, the transformation appears based on alternating vertical stripes, where yellow is changed to magenta in an alternating fashion.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Each stripe is one pixel wide.\n\n2.  **Locate Whites:** Identify the positions of white pixels (0).\n\n3.  **Alternating Replacement:**\n    *   Iterate through the grid, column by column, and row by row.\n    *   If a pixel is white (0), leave it unchanged.\n    * If the color of the current pixel is 4(yellow) and either (the previous pixel along a row was 6, OR the previous pixel in the vertical direction was 6, OR the previous pixel in the diagnoal direction was 6), replace the pixel by 6.\n    * If the color of the current pixel is 6 (magenta) and either (the previous pixel along a row was 4, OR the previous pixel in the vertical direction was 4, OR the previous pixel in the diagnoal direction was 4), keep the pixel as 6.\n\nIn summary, the transformation selectively changes yellow to magenta or magenta to yellow in an alternating fashion. The change appears to occur in alternate positions vertically.\n"
