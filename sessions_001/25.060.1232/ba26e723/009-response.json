The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of some yellow (4) pixels with magenta (6) pixels, specifically at certain positions. The overall grid dimensions (3x11) remain constant. The core pattern seems to relate to the placement of the white (0) pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If yellow exists as a corner in this area, change those yellow pixels to magenta.\n3. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (white and existing yellow pixels not matching the corner criteria) remain unchanged.\n\nIn simple terms, find the corners of white cells and change those corners from yellow to magenta.\n"
