Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements**

*   The input and output are both grids of digits, representing colored pixels.
*   The primary colors involved are white (0) and azure (8).
*   The input grid is larger (7x5) than the output grid (3x3).
*   The output grid seems to be a "zoomed-in" or "cropped" version of a section of the input, focusing on the azure pixels, while maintaining the relative postions of the azure pixels.

**YAML Fact Block**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 7x5
    colors: [white, azure]
    description: The original grid containing a pattern of azure pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors: [white, azure]
    description: A smaller grid derived from the input, representing a focused view of the azure pattern.
  - action: extract_pattern
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Extracts the core azure pattern from the input, discarding surrounding white pixels, while maintaining the relative postions of the azure pixels.
  - relationship:
    subject: output_grid
    predicate: is_derived_from
    object: input_grid
    description: The output grid is a transformed subsection of the input grid.
  - colors:
      0: white
      8: azure
```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the bounding box:** Find the smallest rectangle within the input grid that fully encloses all azure (8) pixels. Consider only complete rows and colums.
2.  **Extract:** Create a new grid. Copy those rows and colums enclosed by the bounding box found in step 1, into the new grid.
3. **Output:** The new grid is the output.

In short - extract the rectangle from the input that contains all of the azure colored pixels.
