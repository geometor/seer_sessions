**input:**

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7CE41B8FC9D0>

**output:**
```
4 0 4

4 4 4
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are yellow (4) and white (0). The input grid appears to be larger than the output grid. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, focusing on the yellow pixels and some of the white pixels. The spatial arrangement of the yellow pixels is maintained, but their relative distances are compressed.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      cells:
        type: pixel
        properties:
          color: [integer, color_name]
          position: [row, column]
    instances:
      input_grid:
        dimensions: [5, 7]
        cells:
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [0, 0]}
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [0, 6]}
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [4, 0]}
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [4, 5]}
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [4, 6]}
          - {color: [0, white], position: [...]}
      output_grid:
        dimensions: [3, 3]
        cells:
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [0, 0]}
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [0, 2]}
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [2, 0]}
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [2, 1]}
          - {color: [4, yellow], position: [2, 2]}
          - {color: [0, white], position: [...]}

actions:
  - type: reduce_grid
    parameters:
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial_compression
    description: The relative positions of yellow pixels are maintained, but the grid is compressed around them.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color yellow (4) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine** the minimum bounding rectangle that encompasses all yellow pixels. The new grid will be the smallest square that holds all yellow pixels
3.  **Create** a new, smaller output grid.
4.  **Copy** the yellow pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding shape.
5.  **Fill** the background with white.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts the smallest square region containing all the yellow pixels, and scales down by removing blank rows and columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
