Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The core concept appears to be extracting a specific pattern of non-zero pixels from the input grid and forming a smaller, condensed output grid. The output grid seems to maintain the relative positions of the non-zero pixels from a specific, repeating section of the input, but it removes some rows and columns that don't contribute to the repeated part.

**Facts (YAML):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - description: Contains a repeating pattern of non-zero pixels.

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - description: A condensed version of the input grid, containing only the core repeating non-zero pattern.

  - name: non_zero_pixels
    type: set of pixels
    properties:
      - values: integers (1-9)
      - description: The key elements forming the pattern.

actions:
    - Extract repeating pattern of non-zero pixels.
    - Condense input array by extracting specific sections.
    - Create new array using pattern and size defined by sections.
    
relationships:
  - input_grid *contains* non_zero_pixels.
  - output_grid *is derived from* input_grid.
  - output_grid *represents* condensed non_zero_pixels.
  - The condensation follows a 3x3 pattern
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with values greater than 0.
2.  **Determine Repeating Pattern:** Observe that the non-zero pixels form a repeating 3x3 block within input grid.
3.  **Condense Rows:** The height of the output is equal to the number of rows containing non-zero elements in every other group of rows.
4.  **Condense Columns:** The width of the output grid is equal to the number of columns that have non-zero elements in every other group of columns.
5.   **Create Output:** Generate output with new dimensions. Copy corresponding values of input pixels to output, only for non-zero values.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts a recurring 3x3 block of non-zero pixels from the input grid and uses this to create new 3x3 output array.
