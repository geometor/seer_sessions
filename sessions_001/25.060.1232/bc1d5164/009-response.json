The primary colors involved are red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The input grid appears larger than the output grid. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, and some selection or filtering of pixels based on their color and/or position.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
