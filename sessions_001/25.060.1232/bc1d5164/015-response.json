The primary colors present are yellow (4) and white (0). The input grid is larger (7x5) than the output grid (3x3). The output grid seems to be a condensed or cropped version of the input, focusing only on the yellow pixels and some of the surrounding white pixels. The relative positions of the yellow pixels are maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
