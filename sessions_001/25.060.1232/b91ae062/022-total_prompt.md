Here's a report on my perception of the task, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception:**

The transformation appears to involve expanding the input grid into a larger output grid. Each color (represented by a number) in the input seems to be replicated into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output. The relative positions of the colors are maintained. The overall shape changes from 3x3 in the input to 9x9 in the output.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid.
  - object: color_block
    properties:
      - color: Value from 0 to 9, representing a specific color.
      - size: Initially 1x1 in the input.
      - expanded_size: 3x3 in the output.
    actions:
      - expand: Replicates the color into a 3x3 block.
  - relationship: spatial_mapping
    description: |
      The relative positions of color blocks in the input are preserved in the output.
      For each cell (x,y) in the input grid, there is a corresponding 3 x 3 block with starting index (x*3, y*3) in the output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell (pixel) in the input 3x3 grid.
2.  For each cell with color 'C' at position (x, y):
    *   **Expand** the cell into a 3x3 block in the output grid.
    *   The top-left corner of this 3x3 block will be at position (x\*3, y\*3) in the output grid.
    *   Fill all nine cells of this 3x3 block with the color 'C'.

In essence, the transformation takes each pixel in the input and blows it up into a 3x3 square of the same color in the output, effectively scaling the entire image by a factor of 3 in both dimensions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
