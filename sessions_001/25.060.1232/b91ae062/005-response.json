            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of expanding each pixel into a 2x2 square. The provided code successfully transforms the training examples. This indicates that the initial hypothesis about pixel expansion is correct and robust across different input grid shapes and color patterns. No errors were reported.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSince there were no errors, the primary strategy is to:\n1.  restate the existing Natural Language Program for maximal clarity and conciseness.\n2.  fully describe the results in YAML format.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nSince there were no errors to report, I will skip running any code and will provide a summary using information in the problem.\n\n**Example Summaries:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 3x3\n    *   Output dimensions: 6x6\n    *   Colors present: White(0), Green(3)\n    * result: Pass\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input dimensions: 5x1\n    *   Output dimensions: 10x2\n    *   Colors present: Blue (1)\n    * result: Pass\n\n*    **Example 3:**\n    *    Input dimensions: 1x1\n    *   Output dimensions: 2x2\n    *   Colors present: Red(2)\n    * result: Pass\n\n**YAML Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  overall_transformation: |\n    The input grid is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.\n    Each pixel in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block of pixels\n    of the same color in the output grid.\n\n  objects:\n    - name: input_grid\n      properties:\n        - type: 2D array\n        - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n        - dimensions: variable (MxN)\n\n    - name: output_grid\n      properties:\n        - type: 2D array\n        - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n        - dimensions: (2M)x(2N) where M and N are input_grid dimensions\n\n  actions:\n    - description: Pixel Expansion\n      details: |\n        Each pixel at coordinates (row, col) in the input grid is mapped\n        to a 2x2 block of pixels in the output_grid. The top-left corner\n        of this block is at coordinates (2*row, 2*col). All pixels within\n        this 2x2 block have the same color as the original input pixel.\n  examples:\n     - example_1:\n        input_shape: 3x3\n        output_shape: 6x6\n        colors: White(0), Green(3)\n        result: Pass\n     - example_2:\n        input_shape: 5x1\n        output_shape: 10x2\n        colors: Blue(1)\n        result: Pass\n     - example_3:\n        input_shape: 1x1\n        output_shape: 2x2\n        colors: Red(2)\n        result: Pass\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Scale Up:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to determine the dimensions of the output grid.\n2.  **Pixel Expansion:** For each pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 square of pixels in the output grid.\n3.  **Color Replication:** The color of the original input pixel is replicated in the corresponding 2x2 square in the output grid. Each cell of the 2x2 block will have the same color.\n4.  **Coordinate Mapping:** A pixel at `(row, col)` in the input maps to a 2x2 block starting at `(2*row, 2*col)` in the output.\n\n"
