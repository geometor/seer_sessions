Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid (3x3) into a larger grid (12x12).  The original grid's colors and their spatial arrangement seem to be the key. Each colored pixel in the input appears to be expanded into a 4x4 block of the same color in the output. The relative positions of the colored blocks are maintained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Initial input grid dimensions
      elements: [pixels] # individual cells
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [12, 12] # Output grid dimensions
      elements: [blocks] # each a group of pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0-9] # Integer representing color
      position: [row, col] # within grid

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Each pixel in the input grid becomes a 4x4 block in the output grid.
    parameters:
      factor: 4 # Expansion factor

relationships:
  - input_grid contains pixels
  - output_grid contains blocks
  - each pixel corresponds to a block, with preserved color and relative positioning
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is 4 times larger in both dimensions than the input grid (12x12 vs. 3x3).

2.  **Iteration:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Get the color of the current pixel.
    *   Determine the corresponding block's top-left corner coordinates in the output grid. This is done by multiplying the pixel's row and column indices by the expansion factor (4).
    *   Fill a 4x4 block in the output grid, starting at the calculated top-left corner, with the pixel's color.

3.  **Completion:** The output grid is now filled with expanded blocks, representing the transformation of the input grid.

In essence, the program takes each pixel in the input and "blows it up" into a 4x4 square of the same color in the output, maintaining the relative layout.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
