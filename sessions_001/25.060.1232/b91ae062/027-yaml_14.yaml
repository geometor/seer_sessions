objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Initial input grid dimensions
      elements: [pixels] # individual cells
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [12, 12] # Output grid dimensions
      elements: [blocks] # each a group of pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0-9] # Integer representing color
      position: [row, col] # within grid

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Each pixel in the input grid becomes a 4x4 block in the output grid.
    parameters:
      factor: 4 # Expansion factor

relationships:
  - input_grid contains pixels
  - output_grid contains blocks
  - each pixel corresponds to a block, with preserved color and relative positioning
