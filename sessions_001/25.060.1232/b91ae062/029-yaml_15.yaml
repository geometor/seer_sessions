task_description: |
  The task involves expanding each pixel of the input grid into a larger block of pixels in the output grid.  The expansion is uniform and maintains the color of the original pixel.

objects:
  - name: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.
    attributes:
      - height: Variable, between 1 and 30.
      - width: Variable, between 1 and 30.
      - pixel_values: Integers ranging from 0 to 9, representing colors.

  - name: output_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors, resulting from the transformation of the input grid.
    attributes:
      - height: 4 times the height of the input_grid.
      - width: 4 times the width of the input_grid.
      - pixel_values: Integers ranging from 0 to 9, representing colors, corresponding to the expanded input pixels.

actions:
  - name: expand_pixel
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 4x4 block of pixels in the output grid.
    input: A single pixel from the input_grid.
    output: A 4x4 block of pixels in the output_grid, all having the same color as the input pixel.
    process: |
      The position of the 4x4 block in the output grid corresponds to the position of the original pixel in the input grid, scaled by a factor of 4.  For example, the pixel at input_grid[0,0] becomes the top-left pixel of the 4x4 block at output_grid[0:4, 0:4].
