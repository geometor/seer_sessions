The colors in the input grid seem to be replicated in the output grid, but in a specific pattern. The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, where each original pixel is transformed into a 2x2 block of the same color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The 2x2 block's top-left corner will be at position (2\\*row, 2\\*column) in the output grid.\n4.  **Fill** all four pixels within this 2x2 block with the same color as the original input pixel.\n\nEssentially, each pixel in the input becomes a 2x2 square of the same color in the output.
