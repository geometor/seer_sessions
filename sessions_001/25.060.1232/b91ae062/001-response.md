Okay, I've reviewed the provided input-output pairs. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid (3x3) of colored pixels into a larger grid. The colors in the input grid appear to be replicated and expanded in the output grid. The replication factor seems to vary, with the output grid's dimensions being multiples of the input grid's dimensions. The background color (0, or white) seems to serve as padding and is used to fill the remaining space in the output grid after the colored areas are expanded.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0-9] # All possible colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable (multiple of input grid dimensions)
      colors: [0-9]
  - name: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: Copy a pixel's color to a larger rectangular area.
  - name: expand
    description: Increase the overall grid dimensions.
  - name: pad
    description: fills output with background

relationships:
  - input_grid TO output_grid: Each pixel in the input_grid corresponds to a rectangular block of the same color in the output_grid.
  - pixel TO pixel_block: A single pixel in input_grid becomes a rectangular block of same color in output

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  For each non-background colored pixel (i.e., not color 0) in the input grid:
    *   **Determine** a replication factor for both the horizontal and vertical dimensions based on how input expands to become output.
    *   **Replicate** the pixel's color to fill a rectangle whose height and width is a multiple of the input grid height/width in the output grid.
    *  The number of pixels replicated is the number of times that non-background colored pixel appears in output
3.  **Fill** the remaining (unfilled) areas of the output grid with the background color (0, white).
4.  Ensure output grid is a rectangular grid with dimensions as multiples of the original grid.

Essentially, each colored pixel in the input grid is "blown up" into a rectangle of the same color in the output grid. The background is filled with the default color (0).
