Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to double the size of the grid and expand each original pixel into a 2x2 square of the same color.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels 
    for row in range(input_height):
        for col in range(input_width):
            # Replicate the pixel's color to form a 2x2 block
            output_grid[row*2:row*2+2, col*2:col*2+2] = input_grid[row, col]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of expanding each pixel into a 2x2 square. The provided code successfully transforms the training examples. This indicates that the initial hypothesis about pixel expansion is correct and robust across different input grid shapes and color patterns. No errors were reported.

**Strategy:**

Since there were no errors, the primary strategy is to:
1.  restate the existing Natural Language Program for maximal clarity and conciseness.
2.  fully describe the results in YAML format.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Since there were no errors to report, I will skip running any code and will provide a summary using information in the problem.

**Example Summaries:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input dimensions: 3x3
    *   Output dimensions: 6x6
    *   Colors present: White(0), Green(3)
    * result: Pass

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input dimensions: 5x1
    *   Output dimensions: 10x2
    *   Colors present: Blue (1)
    * result: Pass

*    **Example 3:**
    *    Input dimensions: 1x1
    *   Output dimensions: 2x2
    *   Colors present: Red(2)
    * result: Pass

**YAML Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  overall_transformation: |
    The input grid is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
    Each pixel in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block of pixels
    of the same color in the output grid.

  objects:
    - name: input_grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
        - dimensions: variable (MxN)

    - name: output_grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
        - dimensions: (2M)x(2N) where M and N are input_grid dimensions

  actions:
    - description: Pixel Expansion
      details: |
        Each pixel at coordinates (row, col) in the input grid is mapped
        to a 2x2 block of pixels in the output_grid. The top-left corner
        of this block is at coordinates (2*row, 2*col). All pixels within
        this 2x2 block have the same color as the original input pixel.
  examples:
     - example_1:
        input_shape: 3x3
        output_shape: 6x6
        colors: White(0), Green(3)
        result: Pass
     - example_2:
        input_shape: 5x1
        output_shape: 10x2
        colors: Blue(1)
        result: Pass
     - example_3:
        input_shape: 1x1
        output_shape: 2x2
        colors: Red(2)
        result: Pass
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scale Up:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to determine the dimensions of the output grid.
2.  **Pixel Expansion:** For each pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 square of pixels in the output grid.
3.  **Color Replication:** The color of the original input pixel is replicated in the corresponding 2x2 square in the output grid. Each cell of the 2x2 block will have the same color.
4.  **Coordinate Mapping:** A pixel at `(row, col)` in the input maps to a 2x2 block starting at `(2*row, 2*col)` in the output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
