facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3, output grid is 6x6.
  - object: Input pixel.
    properties:
      - color: Defined by integer value (0-9).
      - location: (row, column) in the input grid.
    actions:
      - Replicated into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - relationship: Each input pixel's color maps directly to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output.
  - observation: The transformation doubles the dimensions of the grid.
