    The input grid is scaled up by a factor of 2 in both dimensions.
    Each pixel in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block of pixels
    of the same color in the output grid.

  objects:
    - name: input_grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
        - dimensions: variable (MxN)

    - name: output_grid
      properties:
        - type: 2D array
        - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
        - dimensions: (2M)x(2N) where M and N are input_grid dimensions

      details: |
        Each pixel at coordinates (row, col) in the input grid is mapped
        to a 2x2 block of pixels in the output_grid. The top-left corner
        of this block is at coordinates (2*row, 2*col). All pixels within
        this 2x2 block have the same color as the original input pixel.
  examples:
     - example_1:
        input_shape: 3x3
        output_shape: 6x6

     - example_2:
        input_shape: 5x1
        output_shape: 10x2

        result: Pass
     - example_3:
        input_shape: 1x1
        output_shape: 2x2
