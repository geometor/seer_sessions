The grids primarily contain '0' values (white pixels), with a few exceptions. The input grid has a green pixel (3) and a yellow pixel (4). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input, where one row of all zeros has been removed, specifically, the row immediately above the green pixel.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
