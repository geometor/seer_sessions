Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the Green Pixel:** Locate the first instance of a green pixel (value 3) within the input grid. If no green pixel is found, the output is identical to the input.
2.  **Check for Adjacent Zero Rows:** Once the green pixel is found, check for the presence of an all-zero row immediately *above* the green pixel. Also check for the presence of an all-zero row immediately *below* the green pixel.
3.  **Conditional Row Removal:**
    *   If an all-zero row is found *above* the green pixel, remove that row.
    *   Otherwise, if an all-zero row is found *below* the green pixel, remove that row.
    *    If neither condition is met, do not modify the grid.
4.  **Output:** Return the resulting grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
