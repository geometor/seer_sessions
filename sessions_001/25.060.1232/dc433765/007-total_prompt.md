Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the green object and the yellow object within the input grid. Note the presence of the yellow object may vary.
2.  **Calculate Center:** Determine the center of the *output* grid. Since the input and output grids are the same dimensions, we determine the center of the input grid. The center is defined as (rows // 2, cols // 2). For even dimensions, the center is considered as the top-left of the four center pixels.
3.  **Move Green:** Move the green object to the calculated center of the output grid.
4.  **Preserve Yellow** If the yellow object exists, keep in it's original location in the output grid.
5.  **Clear Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid, besides those occupied by the green and yellow object, should be set to white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
