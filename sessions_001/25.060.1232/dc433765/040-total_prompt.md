**input:**
```
0 0 3
0 0 0
4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B95F850>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 3 0
4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B95D6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two non-zero pixels: a green (3) pixel and a yellow (4) pixel. The rest of the pixels are white (0). The output grid also contains the same two non-zero pixels, but their positions appear to have shifted relative to their positions in the input.

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: green
        value: 3
        initial_position: [0, 2]
        final_position: [1, 1]
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
        initial_position: [2, 0]
        final_position: [2, 0]
      - color: white
        value: 0
        initial_position: all other cells
        final_position: fills_remaining
    transformation:
      - description: "Move green to the right center"
      - description: "Yellow stays at the same place"
      - description: "Keep the grid 3 by 3"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0.
2.  **Green Pixel shift:** the green pixel is translated to the center of the grid.
3. **Yellow Pixel**: does not move.
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (value 0) remain 0.
5 **maintain dimensions** Keep the grid 3 by 3.

In more concise terms. Green move to center, Yellow remain at initial position. Keep all other cells empty.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
