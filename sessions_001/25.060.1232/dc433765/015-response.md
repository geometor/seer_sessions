Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (5x5) where each cell can contain a single digit integer (0-9). The input grid has two non-zero values, 3 (green) and 4 (yellow), surrounded by 0s (white). The output grid is nearly identical, except that the '3' has shifted one cell to the right.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task: grid_transformation
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements:
      - type: cell
        values: [0, 3, 4] # Possible cell values, integers
        colors: [white, green, yellow]
properties:
  - grid_size: constant
  - cell_values: integers
  - colors: mapped to integers
actions:
  - move:
      object: cell with value 3
      direction: right
      amount: 1 cell
relationships:
  - spatial: 2D grid arrangement
  - color_value: integer to color mapping
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate the cell containing the value '3' (green) within the input grid.
2.  **Move**: Shift the '3' one cell to the right.
3.  **Preserve**: Keep all other cells, including those with '0' and other non-zero values ('4' in the example) in their original positions.

In essence, the transformation rule is to move only value `3` one position to the right in the grid.
