**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 4
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7CE423308150>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (5x5) where each cell can contain a single digit integer (0-9). The input grid has two non-zero values, 3 (green) and 4 (yellow), surrounded by 0s (white). The output grid is nearly identical, except that the '3' has shifted one cell to the right.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements:
      - type: cell
        values: [0, 3, 4] # Possible cell values, integers
        colors: [white, green, yellow]
properties:
  - grid_size: constant
  - cell_values: integers
  - colors: mapped to integers
actions:
  - move:
      object: cell with value 3
      direction: right
      amount: 1 cell
relationships:
  - spatial: 2D grid arrangement
  - color_value: integer to color mapping
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate the cell containing the value '3' (green) within the input grid.
2.  **Move**: Shift the '3' one cell to the right.
3.  **Preserve**: Keep all other cells, including those with '0' and other non-zero values ('4' in the example) in their original positions.

In essence, the transformation rule is to move only value `3` one position to the right in the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
