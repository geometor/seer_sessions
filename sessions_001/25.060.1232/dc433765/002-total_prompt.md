<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2944x1488 at 0x7CE41B94D050>Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), yellow (4), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve shifting the positions of the non-zero colored pixels within the grid, while keeping the zeros in their original relative positions. The dimensions of the input and output grids remain the same. The key aspect seems to be the relative positioning of colored pixels with respect to each other and to the grid edges, with colored cells moving downwards and the white cells (0) remaining relatively static.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - cells: contain integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
        - 0: white
        - 3: green
        - 4: yellow
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: shift_colored_pixels
    description: Move colored pixels (non-zero) while maintaining their relative order.
    details: >
      Pixels appear to be moved to new positions relative to their original position in the input matrix
      specifically toward the center row.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Relative positions of colored pixels are preserved.
  - type: containment
    description: Pixels are contained within the grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Pixels:** Locate all pixels with non-zero values (in this case, 3 and 4, representing green and yellow).
2.  **Preserve Relative Order**: Ensure the colored pixels, when moved, maintain their order of appearance from left-to-right, top-to-bottom of original position.
3. **Center Row Placement**: Colored cells shift to the middle row, maintaining their relative horizontal positioning.
4.  **Maintain Grid Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
5. **Retain Whites**: Cells that are white (value 0) remain in their original relative locations. Specifically, if a zero is above, below, left, or right of another zero in the input, this relative positioning should exist in the output.

In summary, the transformation involves moving the colored pixels (3 and 4) to the middle row of the grid, maintaining their relative horizontal positions, and ensuring that the size of the matrix does not change. The cells with the 0 value do not appear to be directly part of the logic for moving the non-zero cells, but they do remain in place relative to each other.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
