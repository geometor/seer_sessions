            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: moving a green object to the right. However, the initial program only considered the rightmost boundary. The results of running the code on the training examples show a consistent behavior where the green pixel either moves one step to the right, or if it is on any boundary, it remains there. It's failing because the movement is constrained by *all* boundaries, not just the rightmost one.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Gather Metrics:** Analyze each input/output pair and the program's output to pinpoint exactly when and why the current logic succeeds or fails. I will use code execution to verify positions and boundary conditions.\n2.  **YAML Fact Gathering:** Create a YAML block summarizing observations, focusing on object identification (the green pixel), its initial and final positions, and boundary interactions.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately reflect the observed behavior, especially the refined boundary conditions. The revised program will include checks to ensure the green pixel does not move out of the grid, no matter where the wall is.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using conceptual code execution - not real python):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Green: (2, 0)\n    *   Expected Output Green: (2,1)\n    *   Actual Output Green: (2,1)\n    *   Result: Success\n    *    Edge: No\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Green: (1, 2)\n    *   Expected Output Green: (1, 2)\n    *   Actual Output Green: (1,2)\n    *    Result: Success\n        *   Edge: Right\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Green: (0, 0)\n    *   Expected Output Green: (0, 0)\n    *   Actual Output Green: (0,1)\n    *    Result: **Failure**\n        *    Edge: Left, Top\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: \"green pixel\"\n    value: 3\n    initial_positions:\n      - example_1: [2, 0]\n        constraints: [ \"left\"]\n      - example_2: [1, 2]\n        constraints: [ \"right\"]\n      - example_3: [0, 0]\n        constraints: [ \"top\", \"left\" ]\n    movement: \"attempt to move one cell right\"\n    boundary_conditions:\n      description: |\n         The green pixel will attempt to move one cell right.\n         If the movement would move the pixel to a location outside\n         of the grid in any direction (including top and bottom),\n         then the pixel stays in its original location.\n    \n```\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the green object:** Find the single green pixel (value '3') in the input grid.\n2.  **Attempt to move right:** Attempt to move the green pixel one cell to the right.\n3.  **Boundary condition:** If the green pixel is at *any* edge of the grid (leftmost, rightmost, topmost, or bottommost), do not move. If a move to the right would place the object outside the grid, do not move.\n\n"
