The transformation seems to create a green (3) outline or border around the white (0) pixels. The green pixels appear to trace a spiral pattern or a series of concentric, incomplete rectangles, inwards from the outer edge. The core of the shape is always white and the surrounding shape is always green.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If all pixels within this new boundary are 0 proceed. If not, then halt the transformation process.\n\n4.  **Alternating Insertion:** Change the right-most column of the layer to green.\n\n5.  **Inner Border:** Change the new outermost edge (excluding the first layer) of the remainder of the all-white grid to green (3).\n\n6. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 3-5, moving inwards one layer at a time, until either the subgrid has a width or height of 1, or it has any element with a value other than zero. The spiral shape forms because only some parts of a rectangular boundary is converted to green.\n\nThe algorithm is constructing an inward spiral/concentric rectangles by changing the color and skipping certain parts. It terminates when it has constructed all possible green spiral patterns.\n"
