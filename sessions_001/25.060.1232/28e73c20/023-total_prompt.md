Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).

2.  **Outer Square:** Draw a green (3) square around the entire outer edge of the grid.

3.  **Inner Border:** Create a white (0) border one pixel wide inside the outer green square.

4. **Dynamic Arm Length Calculation:** Calculate the cross arm_length.
    - If the grid size is 11, set it to 1.
    - If grid size is 15, set it to 3.
    - If the grid size is 19, set it to 5.

5.  **Cross:** Draw a green (3) cross centered in the grid. The length of each arm of the cross, extending from the center, is determined by `arm_length`.

6.  **Corner Squares:**
    - If the grid size is 11, no corner squares are drawn.
    - If grid size is 15, 3x3 green corner squares are drawn.
    - If the grid size is 19, 5x5 green corner squares are drawn.

    - The corners are placed adjacent to the ends of the cross arms, fitting within the implied larger square formed by extending the cross arms.

7.  **Center Pixel:** Set the very center pixel of the grid to green (3).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
