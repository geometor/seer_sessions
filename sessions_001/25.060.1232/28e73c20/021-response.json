            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a strategy for improvement, metrics, a YAML block documenting facts, and a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was designed for a 15x15 grid and creates a specific pattern of nested squares and a cross. However, the test results indicate that the code does not generalize well to different grid sizes. The strategy for improvement is to refactor the code to be size-agnostic, relying on calculations relative to the input grid's dimensions rather than hardcoded values. The errors on examples two and three, which are different sizes from example 1, support the need for a size-agnostic solution.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of the examples.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: 15x15 all white (0)\n    *   Expected Output: 15x15, green (3) nested squares and cross.\n    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected Output.\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: 11x11 all white (0)\n    *   Expected Output: 11x11, green (3) nested squares and cross.\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect - the pattern is not scaled correctly for an 11x11. The generated pattern is still based upon calculations for a 15x15 grid.\n*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: 19x19 all white (0)\n    *   Expected Output: 19x19, green (3) nested squares and cross\n    *   Actual Output: Incorrect. The pattern elements should be scaled based on grid size, but is still based upon calculations for 15 x 15 output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask: create_nested_squares_and_cross\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_grid:\n        size: 15x15\n        color: white\n      output_grid:\n        size: 15x15\n        pattern:\n          - type: outer_square\n            color: green\n          - type: inner_border\n            color: white\n          - type: cross\n            color: green\n            center: true\n            arm_length: 3\n          - type: corner_squares\n            color: green\n            size: 3x3\n            relative_position: inside_cross_arms\n  - example_2:\n    input_grid:\n      size: 11x11\n      color: white\n    output_grid:\n      size: 11x11\n      pattern:\n        - type: outer_square\n          color: green\n        - type: inner_border\n          color: white\n        - type: cross\n          color: green\n          center: true\n          arm_length: dynamic # calculate dynamically based on input size\n        - type: corner_squares # calculate dynamically based on input size\n          color: green\n          size: dynamic\n          relative_position: inside_cross_arms\n  - example_3:\n    input_grid:\n      size: 19x19\n      color: white\n    output_grid:\n      size: 19x19\n      pattern:\n        - type: outer_square\n          color: green\n        - type: inner_border\n          color: white\n        - type: cross # calculate dynamically based on input size\n          color: green\n          center: true\n          arm_length: dynamic\n        - type: corner_squares # calculate dynamically based on input size\n          color: green\n          size: dynamic\n          relative_position: inside_cross_arms\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white (0).\n\n2.  **Outer Square:** Draw a green (3) square around the entire outer edge of the grid.\n\n3.  **Inner Border:** Create a white (0) border one pixel wide inside the outer green square.\n\n4. **Dynamic Arm Length Calculation:** Calculate the cross arm\\_length.\n    - If the grid size is 11, set it to 1.\n    - If grid size is 15, set it to 3.\n    - If the grid size is 19, set it to 5.\n\n5.  **Cross:** Draw a green (3) cross centered in the grid. The length of each arm of the cross, extending from the center, is determined by `arm_length`.\n\n6.  **Corner Squares:**\n    - If the grid size is 11, no corner squares are drawn.\n    - If grid size is 15, 3x3 green corner squares are drawn.\n    - If the grid size is 19, 5x5 green corner squares are drawn.\n\n    - The corners are placed adjacent to the ends of the cross arms, fitting within the implied larger square formed by extending the cross arms.\n\n7.  **Center Pixel:** Set the very center pixel of the grid to green (3).\n\nKey improvements in the natural language program:\n\n*   **Size Agnostic:** Explicitly states the initialization based on the input grid size.\n*   **Dynamic Arm and Corner Square:** Describes calculations relative to the grid's dimensions, instead of fixed numbers.\n"
