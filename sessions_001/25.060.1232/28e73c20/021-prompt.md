Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation creates a pattern of nested squares and a cross shape using green (3) on a white (0) background. The process involves:
1. Initializing a 15x15 grid with all 0s (white).
2. Creating an outer green square by changing the outermost border to 3s.
3. Making an inner white border by setting the pixels one inside the outermost border to 0.
4. Drawing a green cross centered in the grid with arms of length 3.
5. Filling the corners inside the cross with 3x3 green squares.
6. Setting the very center point to 3.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
