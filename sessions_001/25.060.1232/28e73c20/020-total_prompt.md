Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 15x15 grid filled entirely with 0s (white pixels). The output is a 15x15 grid with a complex pattern of 0s (white) and 3s (green). The output appears to have a symmetrical, almost fractal-like structure, with nested squares of green and white. There's an "x" pattern of green in white, and the borders of the square change between white and green.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 15x15
      elements:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 3]
  - pixel:
      type: element
      colors:
          0: white
          3: green

actions:
    - replace:
        description: Change pixel values based on a specific pattern.

relationships:
    - spatial:
        description: The pattern is defined by the position of pixels relative to each other and the grid boundaries.
        type: nested_squares
        properties:
          symmetry: yes (both horizontal and vertical)
          center: (7,7)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Start with the input 15x15 grid filled with 0s (white).

2.  **Outer Green Square:** Change all pixels on the outermost border to 3 (green).

3.  **Inner White Border:** Change all pixels to 0 on the row and column that is one inside the outermost border.

4.  **Main Structure Creation:** Create a plus symbol (or a cross) centered in the grid with arms of length 3, using color 3, by changing from 0 to 3.
5.  **Fill corners:** Inside the cross, create filled squares in the corners of size 3 x 3, by setting 3s.

6. **Center point:** Set the center point of the grid to 3 (green)

In summary, the process involves creating nested squares with changing border pixels, and a cross with filled corners using green (3) on a base of white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
