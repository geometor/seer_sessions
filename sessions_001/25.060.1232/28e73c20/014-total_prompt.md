Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is an 8x8 grid filled entirely with 0s (white pixels). The output is also an 8x8 grid, but it contains a combination of 0s (white) and 3s (green). The 3s appear to form a filled square outline or border, while the inside pattern is an arrangement of green and white pixels. The core transformation seems to involve introducing the color green (3) based on a specific geometric pattern, while some of the original white pixels (0) are retained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    values: [0, 3]
    colors: [white, green]

  - type: shape
    description: "outer border of the grid is green"
    color: green

  - type: shape
    description: "filled square within the border with cross"
    color: green
    
relations:
 - "output grid has the same dimension with input grid"
 - "green pixels form the outer border of the grid, which is one pixel in thickness"
 - "some areas of the inner grid, form another, smaller, filled square with a cross-shape"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Create a Border:** Initialize an 8x8 output grid identical to the input grid. Change all pixels on the outermost edge (top, bottom, left, and right borders) to green (value 3).

2.  **Inner square:**
    *   Change the color of cell at coordinates (2,2) to (2,5), (3,2), (3,5), (4,2), (4,3), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) to green (value 3)

3.  **Preserve Zeros:** Ensure that any pixel in the input that is 0 and is not part of the border remains 0 in the output. The introduction of green pixels should not overwrite any existing non-zero value. (Although in this specific example, all input pixels are 0.)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
