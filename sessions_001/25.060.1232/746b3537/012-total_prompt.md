**input:**
```
2 3 3 8 1
2 3 3 8 1
2 3 3 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7CE41B97A450>

**output:**
```
2 3 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x64 at 0x7CE42330A4D0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x5 grid (3 rows, 5 columns) of colored pixels, represented by single-digit integers. The output is a 1x4 grid (1 row, 4 columns) of colored pixels. The colors in the output seem to correspond to some of the colors present in the input, but with a reduced number of pixels and a change in the arrangement/shape of the grid. The input grid has repeating rows, which might be important to the transformation. There are duplicated colors and unique colors in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x5 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 1x4 grid.
  - observation: Input grid has repeating rows.
  - property: Each cell in the grids represents a color.
  - property: Color values are integers from 1 to 9.
  - observation: The colors in output are all present in input
  - observation: Output grid is created using unique colors from each column.
  - observation: two columns in the input which are made up of the same number get combined to make up one in output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Unique Colors Per Column:** Examine each column of the input grid independently. For each column identify the unique color, ignoring duplicates if a column only containts one color it becomes the unique color.
2.  **Construct Output Row:** Create a new row. For each column in the original grid, place the identified (or deduplicated) color in the output row, the output row should now have as many items as there are unique colors per column in the input..

Essentially, the transformation collapses each column down to its unique color, and then combines these unique colors into a single output row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
