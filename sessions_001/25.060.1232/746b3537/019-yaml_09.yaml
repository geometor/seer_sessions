objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain single-digit integers representing colors
      - row-blocks: contiguous rows with identical color values across all columns

  - type: color
    properties:
      - representation: single-digit integer (0-9)
      - mapping: corresponds to a specific color (e.g., 4: yellow, 2: red, 8: azure, 3: green)

actions:
  - identify_row_blocks: locate contiguous rows with identical color values
  - extract_color: determine the single color value of a row-block
  - condense: reduce each row-block to a single representation of its color
  - order_vertically: preserve the original top-to-bottom order of row-blocks in the output

relationships:
  - row-block_contains_color: Each row-block is defined by a single, uniform color.
  - input_to_output: The output is a condensed, ordered representation of the input's row-blocks, showing only each block's color.
