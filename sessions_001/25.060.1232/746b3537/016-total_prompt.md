Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a limited understanding from a single training example. The core idea of identifying similar rows is relevant, but the implementation and, consequently, the description, are too specific and fail to generalize to other examples. The current implementation only considers pairs of rows and extracts single elements instead of full rows, the reshape to force column output is also an unnecessary constraint. We need to shift from a "pair-wise comparison" approach to a more general "identify unique rows and preserve their order" strategy.

**Strategy**

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Examine all input-output pairs to understand the general pattern, don't depend on any prior assumptions from previous tasks.
2.  **Correct Misinterpretations**: Revise the program to deal with complete rows.
3.  **Generalize**: Focus on identifying *all* unique rows, not just pairs.
4.  **Order Preservation**: Ensure the order of unique rows in the output matches their first appearance in the input.
5.  **YAML & Natural Language Program**: Refactor both deliverables.

**Example and Results Metrics & Analysis**

To better understand what is happening in each example, I will use the `display_grid` to see a visualization of each example in the training set:

for i, example in enumerate(task_data['train']):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print("Input:")
    display_grid(np.array(example["input"]))

    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)
    print("Predicted Output:")
    display_grid(predicted_output)    
    print(f"Prediction is correct: {np.array_equal(predicted_output, output_grid)}")
    print("-" * 20)

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
