The input grid appears to have a consistent pattern: pairs of rows with identical colors and values. The output grid seems to extract a single representative value/color from each of these paired rows. The colors and their corresponding numerical values are maintained between the input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Populate this column with the representative rows extracted in step 3, preserving the original vertical order.\n\nIn essence, the transformation collapses pairs of identical rows into single-row representations in the output.\n"
