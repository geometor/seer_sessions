**input:**
```
1 1 1
2 2 2
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B8FFC50>

**output:**
```
1

1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x192 at 0x7CE41B8FC450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid into a 3x1 grid (a single column). The values within the grid represent colors (1: blue, 2: red). The transformation seems to involve extracting a specific column from the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        1: blue
        2: red
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x1
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        1: blue
        2: red

actions:
  - name: extract_column
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    parameters:
      column_index: 0 # first column is index 0

relationships:
  - type: column_extraction
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The output grid is formed by extracting the first column of the input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to extract the first column (index 0) of the input 3x3 grid to create the output 3x1 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
