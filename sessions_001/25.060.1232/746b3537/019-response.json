The output appears to be a simplified, condensed representation of the input grid. Specifically, the output seems to extract the unique colors present in each *row-block* of the input, maintaining their vertical order. A \"row-block\" seems to be defined as a set of contiguous rows with identical values across all columns.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A row-block is a group of one or more consecutive rows where *all* the cells in each row have the *same* color value.\n\n2. **Extract Representative Colors:** For each identified row-block, extract the single color value that represents all cells within that block.\n\n3. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new 1-dimensional grid (a single column).  Each element in this output grid corresponds to a row-block in the input grid, in their original vertical order (from top to bottom). The value of each element in output grid will be representative color of its corresponding row block.\n\n4. The result will be a 1-dimensional grid listing a sequence of color values, where the sequence corresponds to the color of each row block in the input from top to bottom.\n"
