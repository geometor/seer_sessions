**input:**
```
3 4 6
3 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B8FFDD0>

**output:**
```
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x64 at 0x7CE41B95FCD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored squares, where each color represents a digit (as defined in the `COLOR_MAP`). The input grid appears to be reduced in its dimensions to form the output. The output maintains the original ordering and color of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description:
  task_type: grid_transformation
  input:
    type: 2D_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: green (3)
        position: [0,0], [1,0],[2,0]
      - color: yellow (4)
        position: [0,1], [1,1],[2,1]
      - color: magenta (6)
        position: [0,2], [1,2],[2,2]
  output:
    type: 2D_grid
    dimensions: 1x3
    elements:
      - color: green (3)
        position: [0,0]
      - color: yellow (4)
        position: [0,1]
      - color: magenta (6)
        position: [0,2]

  transformation_type: dimension_reduction
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the first row of the input grid.**
2.  **Create a new grid consisting of the first row only.**
3.  **The new grid is the output.**

In simpler terms, extract the first row of the input grid and present it as the output. The transformation collapses the input grid's height to a single row, preserving the top row's colors and their order.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
