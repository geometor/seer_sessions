Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observing 2x2 red squares and placing a blue pixel in a corresponding, but offset, location in a smaller output grid. The test results show that this approach doesn't hold true for all training examples.

The initial hypothesis is only partially correct. The code *does* correctly identify 2x2 red squares. The errors seem to be related to placement of the blue pixel and output size.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Verify Correct Detection:** Double-check that the `find_squares` function is accurately identifying all 2x2 red squares in *all* training inputs. I'll use `code_execution` to examine the intermediate results of this function.
2.  **Analyze Output Dimensions:** Determine the correct relationship between the input and output grid dimensions. The initial assumption of reducing each dimension by 2 is incorrect based on the failing test cases.
3.  **Analyze Blue Pixel Placement:** Determine the precise rule governing where blue pixels are placed relative to the detected red squares. The assumption of output\[y-1, x-1] is wrong.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program and Code:** Based on the findings, I'll refine the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation and then you will revise the code.

**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution)**

I'll use the provided python code, focusing on the `find_squares` function and grid shapes, to gather information on each example.

        for x in range(width - size + 1):
            if grid[y, x] == color and np.all(grid[y:y+size, x:x+size] == color):
                squares.append((x, y))  # Note: Appending (x, y)

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Scan the Input Grid:** Examine the input grid to identify all 2x2 squares where all four pixels are red (color 2).

2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:**
    The output grid's height is input_height - (red-square height + red_square.height - 2).
    The output grid's width is input_width - (red_square.width + red-square.width - 2).

3.  **Place Blue Pixels:** For each 2x2 red square found:
    *   Calculate the output x-coordinate: `output_x = x - (input_grid.shape[1] - output_grid.shape[1])`
    *   Calculate the output y-coordinate: `output_y = y - (input_grid.shape[0] - output_grid.shape[0])`

        where `x` and `y` are the top-left coordinates of the 2x2 red square in the *input* grid.
    *   If the calculated `output_x` and `output_y` are within the bounds of the output grid, place a blue pixel (color 1) at the calculated coordinates in the output grid.

4.  **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid should be white (color 0).

Based on the provided code execution, the output coordinates seem to always use this reduction. The critical change is to use the difference in dimensions.
The previous version incorrectly assumed a fixed reduction of -1,-1

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
