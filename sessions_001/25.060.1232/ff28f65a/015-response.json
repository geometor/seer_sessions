The input grid contains two disconnected 2x2 squares of red (value 2) pixels, with the rest of the grid being white (value 0). The output grid seems to represent a simplified, abstracted version, with blue (value 1) pixels where the red squares were, and white (value 0) elsewhere. It looks like we're reducing the grid to the center 3x3 area and replacing filled regions in the input by single pixels in output, representing some notion of presence or absence of original shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Imagine dividing the input grid in nine 3x3 segments (overlapping is allowed).\n3. **Abstract Representation:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\n4.  **Presence Check:** For each cell in the 3x3 output, if any of the 2x2 red squares from the input *overlap with corresponding 3x3 segment* in the original image, set that output cell to blue (1). Otherwise, set it to white (0).\n\nIn essence, the program detects the presence of red 2x2 squares in area *corresponding* to central 3x3 grid and represents their *presence* by a blue cell.\n"
