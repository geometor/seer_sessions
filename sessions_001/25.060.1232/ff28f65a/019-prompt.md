Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Locate all 2x2 contiguous blocks of red (value 2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Mapping:**  Divide the input grid into nine regions, corresponding to the 3x3 output grid. The regions are determined by dividing the input grid's height and width by 3.
3.  **Abstract Representation:** Create a 3x3 output grid initialized with white (0).
4.  **Presence Check:** For each cell in the 3x3 output grid:
    -   Determine the corresponding region in the input grid.
    -   Check if *any* 2x2 red square exists *anywhere* within that region.
    -   If a red square is found within the region, set the output cell to blue (1). Otherwise, leave it as white (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
