The input grid contains '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The output grid contains '0' (white) and '1' (blue) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in color and a reduction in the number of colored pixels. Specifically, a 2x2 block of red pixels is replaced with a single blue pixel in the top-left corner.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
