The output is a 3x3 grid containing white (0) and blue (1). The output grid appears to be a highly simplified, abstracted representation of the input grid, focusing on the overall shape or pattern formed by the red pixels, and possibly their relative position. It almost looks like we are detecting big connected components.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The 7x7 input does not divide perfectly by three, however a little bit of rounding could be acceptable.\n3.  **Simplify Each Region:** For each of the nine regions in the input grid, observe whether non-white color cells, or \"ink,\" is in the region or not.\n4.  **Populate the Output Grid**: If a region in the input grid contains any \"ink\" pixels, set the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 output grid to blue (1). Otherwise, set it to white (0).\n\nEssentially, the transformation checks for the *presence* of red pixels within nine conceptual regions of the input grid and represents that presence with a blue pixel in the corresponding output region.\n"
