Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 6x6 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two 2x2 squares of red (color 2) pixels, separated by a two-column gap of white (color 0) pixels. The output grid has two blue (color 1) pixels in the top corners, separated by a single, white (color 0) pixel. The rest of the output grid is white. It seems the input squares are "detected" or "represented" as single pixels on output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: square1
    type: square
    color: red (2)
    position: (1,1) # top-left corner
    size: 2x2
  - id: square2
    type: square
    color: red (2)
    position: (4,4) # top-left corner relative to the start of that second square
    size: 2x2
  - id: background
    type: grid
    color: white (0)
    size: 6x6

transformations:
    - action: detect_squares
      input_objects: [ square1, square2 ]
      output:
          size: 3 x 3
          positions:
            square1_representation: (0,0)
            square2_representation: (0,2)
          color: blue (1)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all 2x2 squares of red pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Create** an output with dimensions that compress each original input square, shrinking the original grid size to a third.
3.  **Represent** each identified 2x2 square from the input as a single blue pixel in the output grid. The row is always 0. The column is the original starting column divided by the dimension factor (in this case, 2).
4.  All other pixels in the output grid are white.

In simpler terms: The program finds 2x2 red squares in the input, and for each, creates a blue pixel on the first row output grid with an x position corresponding to original position / 2.
