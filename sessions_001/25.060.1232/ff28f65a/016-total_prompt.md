Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x7 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two disconnected 2x2 squares of red (value 2) pixels, with the rest of the grid being white (value 0). The output grid seems to represent a simplified, abstracted version, with blue (value 1) pixels where the red squares were, and white (value 0) elsewhere. It looks like we're reducing the grid to the center 3x3 area and replacing filled regions in the input by single pixels in output, representing some notion of presence or absence of original shapes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: pixels
    values: [0, 2]
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    values: [0, 1]
  - type: square
    name: red_square_1
    color: red
    dimensions: 2x2
    position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner coordinates in input_grid
  - type: square
    name: red_square_2
    color: red
    dimensions: 2x2
    position: (2,4)

relations:
-  input_grid contains red_square_1
-  input_grid contains red_square_2
- output_grid represents abstract_presence of red_squares
- output_grid is_smaller_than input_grid

actions:
  - action: abstract
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The input grid is abstracted to a smaller 3x3 representation.
  - action: replace
    input: '2'
    output: '1'
    description: Red (2) regions are replaced with single Blue (1) pixel, representing their existence in a certain area.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Locate all 2x2 contiguous blocks of red (value 2) pixels within the 7x7 input grid.
2.  **Center Extraction:** Focus on the central 3x3 region of the input grid. Imagine dividing the input grid in nine 3x3 segments (overlapping is allowed).
3. **Abstract Representation:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
4.  **Presence Check:** For each cell in the 3x3 output, if any of the 2x2 red squares from the input *overlap with corresponding 3x3 segment* in the original image, set that output cell to blue (1). Otherwise, set it to white (0).

In essence, the program detects the presence of red 2x2 squares in area *corresponding* to central 3x3 grid and represents their *presence* by a blue cell.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
