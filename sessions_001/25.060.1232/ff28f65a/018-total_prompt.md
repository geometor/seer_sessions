Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Locate all 2x2 contiguous blocks of red (value 2) pixels within the 7x7 input grid.
2.  **Center Extraction:** Focus on the central 3x3 region of the input grid. Imagine dividing the input grid in nine 3x3 segments (overlapping is allowed).
3. **Abstract Representation:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
4.  **Presence Check:** For each cell in the 3x3 output, if any of the 2x2 red squares from the input *overlap with corresponding 3x3 segment* in the original image, set that output cell to blue (1). Otherwise, set it to white (0).

    squares = []
    for i in range(grid.shape[0] - size + 1):
        for j in range(grid.shape[1] - size + 1):
            if np.all(grid[i:i+size, j:j+size] == color):
                squares.append((i, j))
    return squares

    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)
    
    # Find 2x2 red squares
    red_squares = find_squares(input_grid, 2, 2)

    # Check for overlap and set output grid
    for r_sq in red_squares:
        # Map the top-left corner coordinates of the 2x2 square to the output grid coordinates.
        row_out = r_sq[0] // 2  # scale the row index
        col_out = r_sq[1] // 2  # scale the col index

        # Ensure the output grid coordinate is valid
        if 0 <= row_out < 3 and 0 <= col_out < 3:
           output_grid[row_out, col_out] = 1  # change to 1 (blue)

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a reasonable first attempt, focusing on identifying 2x2 red squares and mapping them to a 3x3 output grid. However, the results across the training examples reveal inconsistencies. The core issue seems to be an incorrect mapping/scaling logic between the location of red squares in the input and the corresponding cells in the output grid. The initial program assumed a direct correspondence that doesn't hold true across all cases, and failed to account for multiple red squares influencing one output cell, or red squares spanning multiple 'output regions'. The strategy for resolving the error must address scaling or downsampling, from regions in the input grid to create the output grid. Also, overlapping is not necessary.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Scaling:** The current scaling (`// 2`) is too simplistic. We need to determine the precise relationship between input grid coordinates and output grid coordinates. Since the input grids change in size, it appears that we need to map different sized regions of the input to the 3x3 output.
2.  **Refine Overlap Logic:** Clarify how the presence of red squares *within a region* of the input determines the output. Instead of a strict corner-based overlap, use a more flexible area-based condition, where red squares may be in any location within the area mapped to the output cell.
3.  **Handle Multiple Squares:** The current logic only sets a cell to blue once. We must accurately reflect whether *any* overlapping region has a red square.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

I'll use `code_execution` to gather specific metrics about the input grids and the identified red squares, and see how they correlate with the expected outputs. We want to confirm sizes and location of the red squares.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def find_squares(grid, size, color):
    squares = []
    for i in range(grid.shape[0] - size + 1):
        for j in range(grid.shape[1] - size + 1):
            if np.all(grid[i:i+size, j:j+size] == color):
                squares.append((i, j))
    return squares

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output):
    red_squares = find_squares(input_grid, 2, 2)
    print(f"Input grid shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"Red squares found: {red_squares}")
    print(f"Expected output: \n{expected_output}")

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
