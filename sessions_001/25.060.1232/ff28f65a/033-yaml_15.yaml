objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    property: static, fills the entire grid initially
  - id: object_1
    color: red (2)
    shape: irregular, appears to consist of two separate 2x2 squares
    property: potentially independently identifiable
  - id: object_2
      color: red (2)
      shape: irregular, appears to consist of one 2x2 squares
      property: potentially independently identifiable
  - id: indicator
    color: blue (1)
    property: indicates presence of red objects in corresponding input region
  - id: output_background
    color: white(0)
    property: fills the output space not occupied by blue indicators

relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    from: object_1, object_2 (input)
    to: indicator (output)
    description: Locations of red objects in the input determine the locations of blue pixels in the output.
  - type: size_reduction
      from: input_grid
      to: output_grid
      description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.

actions:
  - type: object_detection
    description: Identify and locate contiguous regions of red pixels.
  - type: region_mapping
    description: Map the regions of detected red objects to corresponding locations in a smaller output grid.
  - type: presence_indication
    description: Mark the mapped regions in the output grid with blue pixels, other areas are white
