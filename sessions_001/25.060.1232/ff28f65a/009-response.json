The input grid contains two distinct 2x2 squares of color 2 (red). The output grid seems to represent a compressed or abstracted version of the input, with 1's (blue) appearing where the red squares were and 0's (white) everywhere else. The transformation doesn't preserve the full detail of the input but seems to indicate the presence and general location of the red squares. It is essentially showing the top row (y=0) of where there were previously objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
