The input grid contains only 0 (white) and 2 (red) pixels. The output grid contains 0 (white) and 1 (blue) pixels. The output seems to represent a simplified, smaller version of the input, focusing on the presence and relative position of red (2) areas in the input, converting them to blue (1). The transformation appears to extract a specific pattern or feature related to the largest connected red object in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
