Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify a 2x2 block of red (value '2') pixels.** If such block exists, continue, otherwise output = input
2.  **Replace this block:** Create one blue (value '1') pixel located at row 0, column 0.
3. **Clear Remaining Red:** Set all remaining red to white (value '0').
4. **Result:** Return the modified grid.
"""

    # Iterate through the grid to find a 2x2 block of red pixels
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for i in range(rows - 1):
        for j in range(cols - 1):
            if (grid[i, j] == 2 and grid[i + 1, j] == 2 and

    if red_block_coords:
       # if found replace with blue pixel at [0,0]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly identified the presence of a 2x2 red block and replaced it with a single blue pixel at [0,0]. However, it's clear from the other training examples that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core issue is that the location of the single blue pixel needs to be determined by properties of the red 2x2 square, not just placed at [0,0].

Here's the refined strategy:

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs in the training set to identify the consistent relationship between the 2x2 red block and the resulting blue pixel. The placement of the resulting blue pixel relative to the original 2x2 red square is critical, and consistent.
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language description to accurately reflect the generalized transformation rule, paying close attention to the positioning logic. It is likely to be one of the corners of the square.
3.  **Update observations:** Capture key properties and relationships in the YAML.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get a more precise understanding of the relationship between the input and output, We'll focus on the coordinates where a 2x2 red block is found, and the coordinates where the single blue pixel ends up.

            if (grid[i, j] == 2 and grid[i + 1, j] == 2 and
                grid[i, j + 1] == 2 and grid[i + 1, j + 1] == 2):
                return (i, j)
    return None

    rows, cols = grid.shape

        blue_pixel_coords = find_blue_pixel(output_grid)

        results.append({
            'red_block_top_left': red_block_coords,
            'blue_pixel': blue_pixel_coords

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
