      The output grid is smaller than the input grid by 2 in both dimensions.
      Each 2x2 red square in the input is represented by a single blue pixel
      in the output. The blue pixel's x-coordinate corresponds to the
      red square's top-left x-coordinate - 1. All of the blue squares are on row 0
