Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 5x5 grid containing a 2x2 block of red (value 2) pixels in the top-left corner. The rest of the grid is white (value 0).\n*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid with a single blue (value 1) pixel in the top-left corner. The rest of the grid is white (value 0).\n*   **Transformation:** It seems like the 2x2 red block is being represented by a single pixel of a different color (blue) and the overall grid size is being reduced. It is reducing the overall grid, but keeping the object in the upper left corner.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
