Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x7 grid containing two colors: white (0) and red (2). The output is a 3x3 grid containing white (0) and blue (1). The output grid appears to be a highly simplified, abstracted representation of the input grid, focusing on the overall shape or pattern formed by the red pixels, and possibly their relative position. It almost looks like we are detecting big connected components.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 7x7
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_colors:
    - white (0)
    - red (2)
  - output_colors:
    - white (0)
    - blue (1)
  - input_object: A pattern of red and white cells.
  - output_object: An abstract representation of the input's red cell pattern as a blue/white grid.
  - operation: Simplification or abstraction of the larger input grid into the output grid with reduction of colors.
  - spatial_relationship: The output seems to represent the simplified structure of non-white colored cells.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "ink":** Consider only the non-white pixels in the input grid (in this case, the red pixels).
2.  **Divide and Conquer:** Conceptually divide the input grid into nine roughly equal regions, corresponding to the 3x3 output grid. The 7x7 input does not divide perfectly by three, however a little bit of rounding could be acceptable.
3.  **Simplify Each Region:** For each of the nine regions in the input grid, observe whether non-white color cells, or "ink," is in the region or not.
4.  **Populate the Output Grid**: If a region in the input grid contains any "ink" pixels, set the corresponding pixel in the 3x3 output grid to blue (1). Otherwise, set it to white (0).

Essentially, the transformation checks for the *presence* of red pixels within nine conceptual regions of the input grid and represents that presence with a blue pixel in the corresponding output region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
