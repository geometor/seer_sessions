observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      shape: variable
    actions:
      - divided into regions based on output_grid shape
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers, predominantly 0 (white) and 1 (blue)
      shape: variable, smaller than input_grid
    actions: []
  - object: regions
    properties:
      type: sub-arrays of input_grid
      shape: determined by the ratio of input_grid and output_grid dimensions
      content: contain pixels from input_grid
    actions:
      - presence of non-zero pixels determines corresponding output_grid pixel value
  - general:
      relationship: output_grid represents a simplified view of input_grid, indicating presence/absence of non-zero (red) ink
      ratio: input_grid dimensions are proportional to output_grid dimensions (approximately)
