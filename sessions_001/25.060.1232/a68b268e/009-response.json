The input grid appears to contain several colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed or summarized version of the input, retaining some, but not all, of the original colors. The output grid is significantly smaller, suggesting a substantial reduction or filtering of information. It appears there is not a simple 1:1 correspondence or direct mapping of input cells to output cells.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
