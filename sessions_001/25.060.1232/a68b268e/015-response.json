Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The input grid has a horizontal line of blue (1) pixels dividing it roughly in half. There are distinct colored regions above and below this line. The output grid seems to be a condensed or summarized version of a specific area in the input. The output grid preserves some colors and relative positions of colored regions, but it is not a simple sub-grid extraction. The output consists of the four corner colors of the input, with a row of orange (7) at the bottom, and below it an azure (8) at the bottom left and white (0) bottom right.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
