Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colored pixels, while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, retaining some, but not all, of the original colors. The central blue vertical line of 1s in the input grid seems important as it is between two regions and is the only straight line.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 9x9
        elements: pixels (integers 0-9, representing colors)
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 4x4
        elements: pixels (integers 0-9, representing colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) within a grid

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Specific pixels from the input_grid are selected to form the output_grid.
  - type: arrangement
    description: The selected pixels are arranged in a new, smaller grid.

relationships:
 - input_grid contains multiple pixel objects.
 - output_grid contains a subset of pixel objects from input_grid, potentially with some transformation.
 - spatial relationship is key to determining selection

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Line:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid, which is between different colored regions on the grid.

2.  **Define Regions:** Consider the two regions formed on the grid. The first on the left of the blue line (1s) and the other on the right.

3. **Select Sub-grid:** From the input grid, define and select two 2 x 4 regions. The first region will start from the left top corner until the column before the blue line. The second will start after the blue line until the end and on the same rows as the first region.

4.  **Transpose the subgrids:** Rotate both selected region by 90 degrees clockwise

5.  **Combine:** combine these regions to form a 4 x 4 grid, placing the right rotated region above the left rotated region.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
