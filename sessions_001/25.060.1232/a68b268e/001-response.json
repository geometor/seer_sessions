A prominent feature is a horizontal line of '1's (blue) dividing the input grid into upper and lower sections. The output grids are consistently 4x4.  Colors in the output seem to be derived from the input, but their positions are altered, and the blue dividing line is absent. It seems input colors above the line are extracted somehow, and re-arranged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
