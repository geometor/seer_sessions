objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 9x9
        elements: pixels (integers 0-9, representing colors)
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 4x4
        elements: pixels (integers 0-9, representing colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) within a grid

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Specific pixels from the input_grid are selected to form the output_grid.
  - type: arrangement
    description: The selected pixels are arranged in a new, smaller grid.

relationships:
 - input_grid contains multiple pixel objects.
 - output_grid contains a subset of pixel objects from input_grid, potentially with some transformation.
 - spatial relationship is key to determining selection
