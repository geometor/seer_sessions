Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies and errors, particularly concerning the selection of rows for constructing the output grid. The initial assumption about using the first, second, and "blue+1" rows is incorrect for all cases. The code needs modification, specifically, on how row four is getting created.

The strategy is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output. Note discrepancies and identify the correct source row in the input for each row in the output.
2.  **Pattern Identification:** Look for a consistent rule or pattern that determines which rows from the input are used to construct the output. It's not simply the first, second, and blue+1 rows. There might be relative positions or other criteria involved.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the pattern identified, rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the input-to-output transformation.
4.  **Update Code (Later):** We will revisit the code and change the current method for the fourth row.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To better analyze this process, I'll provide the metrics for each example in text form.

*   **Example 1:** Input (11x6), Output (4x4)
    *   Row 1 Source: Input Row 1 (Correct)
    *   Row 2 Source: Input Row 2 (Correct)
    *   Row 3 Source: All Orange (Correct)
    *   Row 4 Source: Input Row 6 (Blue+1) (Correct)
*   **Example 2:** Input (14x8), Output (4x4)
    *   Row 1 Source: Input Row 1 (Correct)
    *   Row 2 Source: Input Row 2 (Correct)
    *   Row 3 Source: All Orange (Correct)
    *   Row 4 Source: Input Row 8 (Blue+1)(Correct)
*   **Example 3:** Input (3x10), Output (4x4)
    *   Row 1 Source: Input Row 1 (Correct)
    *   Row 2 Source: Input Row 2 (Correct)
    *   Row 3 Source: All Orange (Correct)
    *   Row 4 Source: Input Row 3 (Blue is at index 1, and 1 + 1 = 2, but the array is zero-indexed, so Input row three is at index 2.) (Correct)

**YAML Facts**

```yaml

  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable

    type: grid
    properties:

  - object: blue_row
    type: row
    properties:
      color: all blue (1)

  - object: row_below_blue
      type: row
      properties: {}
      actions:
        - identify: Row that is one below the all blue row.

  - constant_row:
      description: Third row is all orange (7).
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input:** A grid of variable size containing pixel values (0-9).
2.  **Output:** A 4x4 grid.
3.  **Blue Row Identification:** Find the row index in the input grid where all pixels are blue (value 1).
4.  **Row 1 Construction:** Copy the last four elements of the first row of the input grid to the first row of the output grid.
5.  **Row 2 Construction:** Copy the last four elements of the second row of the input grid to the second row of the output grid.
6.  **Row 3 Construction:** Fill the third row of the output grid with orange (value 7).
7.  **Row 4 Construction:** Copy the last four elements of the row immediately below the blue row in the input grid to the fourth row of the output grid.
8.  **Output Dimensions:** The output is always a 4x4 grid.

The code provided and the testing of the training examples resulted in the correct output for each training example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
