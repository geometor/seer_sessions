facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    observations:
      - contains multiple distinct colored regions
      - presence of horizontal and vertical lines
      - orange (7), yellow(4), azure (8) and magenta (6) colors are prominent in distinct regions separated by the blue(1) line
      - a blue horizontal line of 1s separates two regions

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
    observations:
      - colors seem to correlate with regions in the input_grid
      - size is significantly smaller than the input_grid

  - relationship: input_to_output
    type: transformation
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid, likely by summarizing or abstracting larger regions into single pixels.
    details:
      - The top-left corner of each of the four regions (orange, yellow, azure, magenta) in input is retained in the output.
      - The output consists of the top-left corner pixel of each of these regions and a horizontal line separating the two.
