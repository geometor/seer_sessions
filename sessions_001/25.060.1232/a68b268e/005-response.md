Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and devise a strategy for improvement.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed based on the first training example, which involved identifying a central vertical blue line, selecting two 2x4 regions on either side, rotating those regions, and concatenating them. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this approach is too specific and doesn't generalize well. The core issue is that the initial assumption of a central *vertical* blue line, and the selection of specific subgrids need to account for cases where the grid dimensions are different.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** The central blue line might not always be vertical, it could be horizontal. Also the shapes are not consistent between examples.

2.  **Generalized Subgrid Selection:** Instead of hardcoding the subgrid dimensions (2x4), we need a more flexible way to identify and select the relevant regions based on the position of the blue line (or other potential delimiters).

3.  **Handle Different Line Orientations:** The code currently only looks for a vertical line. It needs to be extended to detect horizontal lines as well.

4.  **Consistent rotation:** verify if all subgrids are rotated.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

To understand each example better, let's use code to get properties.
