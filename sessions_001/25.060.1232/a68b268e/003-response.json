The input grid contains various colored pixels, while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, retaining some, but not all, of the original colors. The central blue vertical line of 1s in the input grid seems important as it is between two regions and is the only straight line.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The first on the left of the blue line (1s) and the other on the right.\n\n3. **Select Sub-grid:** From the input grid, define and select two 2 x 4 regions. The first region will start from the left top corner until the column before the blue line. The second will start after the blue line until the end and on the same rows as the first region.\n\n4.  **Transpose the subgrids:** Rotate both selected region by 90 degrees clockwise\n\n5.  **Combine:** combine these regions to form a 4 x 4 grid, placing the right rotated region above the left rotated region.\n\n"
