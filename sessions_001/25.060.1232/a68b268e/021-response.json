There are distinct colored regions, including orange (7), black (0), blue (1), yellow (4), azure (8), and magenta (6). A prominent feature is the vertical blue line (1) in the center.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 4x4 grid, significantly smaller than the input. It seems to retain some colors from the input (orange, azure, yellow, magenta), but in a different arrangement. The positions and overall structure are drastically different. It appears we are not simply cropping or scaling.\n*   **Transformation:** It's likely that the output extracts specific pixels based on a certain rule, which relates to relative position of colored regions in the input relative to the central blue line.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This line serves as a reference point.\n2.  **Observe the pattern:** Moving from left-to-right, and top-to-bottom, select the first occurance of colors in this order: orange, azure, yellow, magenta.\n3. **Extract Selected Pixels**: Once this set of colors is found, record the next occurance in the order, repeating the sequence.\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid. Arrange the extracted pixels into the 4x4 grid, row by row.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts one pixel of each of four distinct colors (orange, azure, yellow, magenta), which appear to have a specific relationship with the central blue. It is important to note that the pixels surrounding the blue line in the middle column and row do not appear in the final result. The selected pixels are assembled into a new, smaller grid.\n"
