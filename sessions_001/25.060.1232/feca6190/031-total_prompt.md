Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input is a single-row grid containing a single non-zero pixel. The output is a square grid.
The size of the output grid is determined by the position of the non-zero pixel in the input row,
counting from right to left (size = length of input row - index of non-zero pixel).
The output grid contains a diagonal line of the non-zero pixel's color, running from the top-right
to the bottom-left. The number of colored pixels in the output is equal to the output grid's dimension.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid (single-row) into a square output grid with a diagonal.

    Args:
        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid (single row).

    Returns:
        A 2D numpy array representing the square output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
