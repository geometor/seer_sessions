Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the Non-Zero Pixel:** Examine the input grid to identify the single pixel with a non-zero value (representing a color other than white). Note its color and its position (row and column indices).

2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** Create an output grid whose both dimensions are equal to the length of the diagonal. This length should be determined by getting the maximum dimension from input.

3.  **Create the Diagonal:** In the output grid, create a diagonal line of pixels.
    *   If the input contains only 1 row, then the diagonal starts from the bottom-left corner, and moving one step up and one step right for each subsequent pixel on this diagonal.
    *   Otherwise, The diagonal goes from the top-right.
    *   The length of the diagonal will be equal to the largest dimension from the input.
    *   All pixels on the diagonal should have the same color as the non-zero pixel found in the input grid.

4.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** Set all pixels in the output grid that are *not* part of the diagonal to white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
