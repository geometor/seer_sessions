Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved placing a single row of pixels along the anti-diagonal of a 15x15 grid. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this approach is too specific and doesn't generalize. The size of the output grid and the placement of the input are not consistent across all examples. Some examples include multiple repetitions of the input. The strategy should be to identify a more general rule that takes the dimensions of both the input and output grids into consideration.

**Metrics and Observations**

I will generate a simple report here for brevity - in the future code_execution will be used.

*   **Example 1:** Input (1x3), Output (15x15) - SUCCESS. The initial rule works correctly.
*   **Example 2:** Input (1x3), Output (3x3) - FAIL. The output grid size is different, and the input is repeated to fill the output grid. The input row constitutes the first row of the output, then is repeated below, shifted right one, and truncated if it goes beyond the dimensions of the grid.
*   **Example 3:** Input (1x12), Output (12x12) - FAIL. Similar to Example 2, the dimensions are different, the input row becomes the first row of the output grid. The following rows contain the input row shifted to the right one position.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        shape: 1x3
        data_type: int
      output:
        shape: 15x15
        data_type: int
        pattern: input row along anti-diagonal, rest are black.
      result: PASS
  - example_2:
      input:
        shape: 1x3
        data_type: int
      output:
        shape: 3x3
        data_type: int
        pattern: >
          input row as first output row, repeated and shifted
          right on subsequent rows.
      result: FAIL
  - example_3:
      input:
        shape: 1x12
        data_type: int
      output:
        shape: 12x12
        data_type: int
        pattern: >
          input row as first output row, repeated and shifted
          right on subsequent rows.
      result: FAIL

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Output Grid Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the number of columns of the input grid (NxN).
2. **First row:** The first row of the output grid is the same as the input row.
3.  **Subsequent Rows:** Each subsequent row of the output grid takes the previous row and applies a circular shift to the right by one position.
