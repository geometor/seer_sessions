facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 1x5 grid representing a sequence of colors.
  - observation: |
      The output is a 10x10 grid.
  - observation: |
      Each color in the input grid generates a diagonal line of pixels in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      The diagonals start on a "baseline" which is itself a diagonal running from (9,0) to (5,4) of the output grid.
  - observation: |
      The starting point of each diagonal on the baseline corresponds to the index of the color in the input grid.  The first color (index 0) starts at (9,0), the second (index 1) at (8,1), and so on.
  - observation: |
      The length of each diagonal is equal to its starting index in the input grid plus one. The first diagonal has length 1, the second has length 2, etc.
  - observation: |
      Diagonals extend upwards and to the right.
  - observation: |
     The color of the diagonal is determined by color of the pixel at that position in the input
