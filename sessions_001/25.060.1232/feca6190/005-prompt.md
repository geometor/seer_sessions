Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a 1x5 input grid into a 10x10 output grid by expanding each element
of the input diagonally from bottom-left to top-right, adding zeros to each
side of the original input pixel colors.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize a 10x10 output grid filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((10, 10), dtype=int)
    input_height = len(input_grid)
    input_width = len(input_grid[0])
   
    # Diagonal Expansion: Iterate through each element in the input.
    for n in range(input_width):
        # Place the current input element at the bottom-left starting position.
        output_grid[10 - n -1][n] = input_grid[0][n]

        # Expand diagonally upwards and to the right.
        for i in range(1, 9):
           if 10 - n - 1 - i >= 0 and n + i < 10:
            output_grid[10 - n - 1 - i][n + i] = input_grid[0][n]
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
