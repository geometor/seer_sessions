The input row appears to be replicated diagonally in the output, with the rest of the output grid filled with black (color 0). The diagonal pattern expands from the bottom-left corner towards the top-right corner. The dimensions of output grid is equal to input row length multiplied by number of elements in a row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case width of the input row is five, and its length is 1, so 5 x 1 = 5. It gives dimensions of 5x5 *incorrect*, the size of the output is 15 x 15.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an N x N grid filled with black pixels (color 0).\n3. **Initialization**: Multiply length and width of the input to get step size.\n4.  **Replicate Diagonally:** Iterate through the input row. For each element in the input row, replicate its color value diagonally on output grid. The diagonal starts from the bottom-left corner. With each step move one column to the right and one row up and put the next element from the input grid.\n5. **Fill remaining**: Fill the remaining pixels with 0.\n\nI made a mistake by perceiving the length. It should be 15.\n\n1.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid's dimensions are N x N, where N is the length of the input row multiplied by number of columns in a row. In this case input row length is five, and its number of column is 1, so 5 * 1 = 5. The output size is 15 x 15.\n2. **Create Output Grid**: Initialize an N x N grid fill with color 0.\n3.  **Copy input**: Iterate the input row. For each element, place in the output grid in diagonal fashion.\n4. Start at bottom left corner with first element. Then shift one element up and one right, and put a next item from the input row.\n\n"
