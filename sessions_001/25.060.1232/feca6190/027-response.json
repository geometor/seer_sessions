The non-zero element in the input row appears to be the seed for a diagonal pattern in the output grid. The size of the output grid seems related to the position of the non-zero element in the input.  Specifically, a single colored pixel on the first row expands into a diagonal line extending from top-right to bottom-left.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The element at the top-most row is at index N(counting from left to right).\n4. **Fill cells with non-zero value**: iterate rows from i=0 to N-1, and on row[i], write the value to the output grid at column[N - 1 - i].\n\nIn essence, the position of the non-zero number in the input determines the output's grid size, the non-zero number itself is repeated along a diagonal.\n"
