        [[4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]]
        ```
    *   Actual Output (from provided code, and also what should happen):

        ```
        [[4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]
         [4 4 4 4 4 0 4]]
        ```
        Result: The current code produced the expected output on this case *by accident*. The description states that a diagonal should be made but the program and code duplicated the row.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8]]`
    *   Expected Output:

        ```
        [[8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]]
        ```
    *   Actual Output (from provided code):

        ```
        [[8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]
         [8 8 0 8 8 8 0 0 8]]

        ```
    Result: The current code *happens* to work again but it isn't doing the correct steps as described.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2]]`
    *   Expected Output:

        ```
        [[2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]]
        ```
    *   Actual Output (from provided code):
        ```
        [[2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]
         [2 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2]]
        ```
    Result: Same as above.
