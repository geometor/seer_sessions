Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 1x5 grid (single row) containing numerical values representing colors. The colors present are blue (1), white (0), and orange (7).
*   **Output:** A 10x10 grid. The input grid's contents appear to be "expanded" or "projected" diagonally, creating a larger grid, with the diagonal running from the bottom-left to top-right. The original values seem to act as a "seed" for this diagonal expansion.
* The output grid expands the original elements and all pixels have had zeros added to each side.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x5
    elements: [1, 0, 7, 0, 0]  # Blue, White, Orange, White, White
    properties:
      - single_row: true

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    properties:
        - diagonal_pattern: true
  - relation:
    type: expansion
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: "Each element in input_grid is expanded diagonally and zeros added to the side of each pixel to make a 10 x 10 grid"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 10x10 output grid filled with zeros (white).

2.  **Diagonal Expansion:** For each element in the input grid, starting from the bottom-left corner of the output grid and for n = number of input pixels:
    *   Place the element's value at position output\_grid\[10-n]\[n-1].
    *   Iterate a counter, i, from 1 to 9:
        *   Place the element from input[n-1] into grid location output\_grid\[10-n-i]\[n-1+i]

3.  **Complete.** The 10x10 output grid now represents the expanded input, with zeros forming the filler and other colors expanding diagonally.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
