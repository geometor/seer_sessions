Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule takes a 1x5 input grid and expands it into a 5x5 output grid.
The single non-zero (red) pixel in the input grid becomes a diagonal line of red pixels
in the output grid, stretching from the bottom-left to the top-right.
All other pixels in the output grid are white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the 5x5 output grid with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((5, 5), dtype=int)

    # Find the non-zero pixel in the input grid.
    non_zero_indices = np.where(input_grid != 0)
    non_zero_value = input_grid[non_zero_indices]

    # Check to handle potential empty input or no non-zero elements.
    if non_zero_indices[0].size > 0 :
          # Create the diagonal line of red pixels in output.
          for i in range(5):
            output_grid[4-i, i] = non_zero_value[0]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
