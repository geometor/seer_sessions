The non-zero values in the input grid seem to be \"projected\" diagonally in both directions within the output grid.  Zero values in the input are treated as \"background\" and are not explicitly projected, but influence the size of the output. The output grid appears to be a square matrix. The dimension of the output matrix is defined by the length of the input array. The number of non zero values defines the length of the diagonal.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

The output will be a square grid of size NxN.\n\n2. **Iterate Input:** For each element in the input array, get its value and its index (position).\n\n3. **Diagonal Projection (if non-zero):** If the element's value is not zero, perform the following:\n   a. **Create two diagonals:** In the output grid, draw a diagonal line of the same color (value) as the current input element, starting from the top row, at the column corresponding to the input element's index. Extend this diagonal downwards and to the left.\n   b. Simultaneously, create a second diagonal of the same color, starting at the same position in the input grid on the top row, but expanding it downwards and to the right.\n\n4. **Zero Handling:** Zero values in the input array are skipped (no diagonal is drawn).  They serve to define the size of the output. They are the background.\n\n5. **Complete Output:** The final output grid is the result of all diagonal projections, with zeros filling the remaining cells.\n\nIn essence, the non zero elements form a cross, and it's coordinates are determined by the index and the value of the input elements.\n"
