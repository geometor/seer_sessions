task_elements:
  - type: input_grid
    description: 1-dimensional array of integers (0-9). Represents colors.
    properties:
      - size: 1xN (where N varies)
      - values: integers from 0 to 9

  - type: output_grid
    description: 2-dimensional array of integers (0-9). Represents colors.
    properties:
      - size: NxN (square matrix where N is equal to the number of elements on input array)
      - values: integers from 0 to 9

  - type: transformation
    description:  Expands the input grid into a square output grid, projecting non-zero values diagonally.
    operations:
      - input_size_determination: "The number of elements N in the input array, determines the dimensions (NxN) of the output grid."
      - diagonal_projection: "Each non-zero element in the input array creates a diagonal line of the same value in the output grid."
      - diagonal_direction: "The diagonals run from top-right to bottom-left and from top-left to bottom-right, intersecting at cells corresponding to the original position of the input element."
      - zero_handling: "Zero values in the input do not create diagonals; they define the size of the output square."
