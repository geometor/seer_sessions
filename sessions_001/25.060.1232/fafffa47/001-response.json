The top grid contains the color maroon (9) and white (0), while the bottom grid consists of blue (1) and white (0). The output is a single grid, smaller in height than the combined input grids, and contains only red (2) and white (0). The maroon and blue colors in the input grid are replaced by red and white, respectively, in the output grid. It seems like the height of input is reduced.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
