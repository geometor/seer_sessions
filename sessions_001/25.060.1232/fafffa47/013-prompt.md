Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is reduced to the upper 3xN subgrid, where N is the original width.
Maroon (9) becomes red (2), all other colors are unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # Get dimensions of input
    height = input_array.shape[0]
    width = input_array.shape[1]

    # Initialize an empty 3xN output grid filled with white (0).
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, width), dtype=int)

    # Process the upper subgrid (first 3 rows).
    for i in range(min(3, height)):  # Ensure we don't go out of bounds
        for j in range(width):
            if input_array[i, j] == 9:  # If the cell is maroon (9)
                output_grid[i, j] = 2  # Change it to red (2)
            else:
                output_grid[i,j] = input_array[i,j]

    return output_grid.tolist()

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
