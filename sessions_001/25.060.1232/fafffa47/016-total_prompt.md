**input:**
```
0 9 0
9 0 9
9 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7CE41B857BD0>

**output:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE42330B2D0>
Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 6x3 grid containing the colors maroon (9), blue (1), and white (0). The output is a 3x3 grid containing only red (2) and white (0). It appears that the input grid is being reduced in size, and the maroon (9) and blue (1) pixels in specific locations are transformed to Red(2) while white (0) pixels seem to mostly stay as white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x3
    elements: [0, 9, 1]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 2]
  - name: pixel_colors_in
    elements:
        0: white
        9: maroon
        1: blue
  - name: pixel_colors_out
    elements:
        0: white
        2: red

actions:
  - name: size_reduction
    description: The input grid's dimensions are reduced by half.
  - name: color_transformation
    description: Specific colors are changed to red (2), seemingly based on position, where maroon (9) and blue (1) values are replaced with red(2).
  - name: color_retention
    description: Some colors remain unchanged (white).

relationships:
    - input grid is transformed to output grid
    - height of input_grid is twice the height of output_grid
    - width of the input grid is the same as the output grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 6x3 input grid.

2.  **Dimension Reduction:** Create a 3x3 output grid. The height will be half of the input, and the width will be the same.

3.  **Color Transformation (Top Half):**
    *   Iterate through the top half (first three rows) of the *input* grid (rows 0-2 inclusive).
    *   For each row in the top half:
        * if the cell in column 0 is maroon (9), a cell with Red(2) is placed in the top half output grid (rows 0-2) at the mirrored horizontal location, column 2.
        * if the cell in column 2 is maroon(9), a cell with Red(2) is placed in the top half output grid (rows 0-2) at the mirrored horizontal location, column 0.

4.  **Color Transformation (Bottom Half):**
    *   Iterate starting at the middle row of the *input* grid (rows 3-5)
    *   If a cell contains a blue (1), the next row below at the same location is transformed to red (2) in the output grid.

5. White Retention:
    * White cells in general remain unchanged.
    * The exception being where maroon cells are located, causing a red(2) cell to exist at the mirrored horizontal postion.

6. Transfer.
    * All the mirrored locations are changed in the Top half output grid, rows 0-2.

7.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
