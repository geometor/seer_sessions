Previous Code:
```python
"""
Divides the input grid into 2x1 sections and maps colors based on the presence of maroon (9) and blue (1) pixels.
If maroon is present in the section, the output is red (2). Otherwise, the output is white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on 2x1 sections, mapping to red (2) if maroon (9) is present,
    and white (0) otherwise.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    height, width = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((height // 2, width), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through each 2x1 section
    for i in range(0, height, 2):
        for j in range(width):
            section = input_grid[i:i+2, j:j+1]

            # Map colors based on section content
            if 9 in section:
                output_grid[i//2, j] = 2  # Red if maroon is present
            else:
                output_grid[i//2, j] = 0  # White otherwise

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a reasonable hypothesis, dividing the input grid into 2x1 sections and checking for the presence of maroon (9). However, the results across multiple examples indicate that this hypothesis, while partially correct for some cases, is not universally applicable. The primary issue is that while the presence of maroon (9) *sometimes* results in red (2), the initial hypothesis is oversimplified. A more refined approach would be to consider the section of the input and derive the output based on its value at 0.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, noting not just the presence of maroon, but also the overall configuration and relationship between pixels within the 2x1 sections and the output.
2.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Based on the detailed analysis, adjust the hypothesis to incorporate additional rules or conditions that govern the transformation. The presence/absence of maroon might be a *part* of the rule, but it's clearly not the *whole* rule.
3.  **Iterative Improvement:** Test the refined hypothesis and repeat the analysis and refinement process until the code correctly handles all training examples.

**Example and Results Metrics:**

To aid in pattern recognition, let's create a helper function to extract relevant information from each example and its results. We are most interested in the contents of the 2x1 sections.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_section(input_grid):
    """
    Analyzes 2x1 sections of the input grid and reports their contents.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    height, width = input_grid.shape
    section_data = []

    for i in range(0, height, 2):
        for j in range(width):
            section = input_grid[i:i+2, j:j+1]
            section_data.append({
                'row_start': i,
                'col': j,
                'contents': section.tolist(),
                'has_maroon': 9 in section,
                'top_value' : section[0][0]
            })

    return section_data

def test_transform_with_analysis(task, transform_function):
    """
    Tests the transform function on each example and provides section analysis.
    """
    results = []
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output_grid = example['output']
        predicted_output_grid = transform_function(input_grid)
        is_correct = predicted_output_grid == expected_output_grid

        section_analysis = analyze_section(input_grid)

        results.append({
            'input': input_grid,
            'expected_output': expected_output_grid,
            'predicted_output': predicted_output_grid,
            'is_correct': is_correct,
            'section_analysis': section_analysis
        })
    return results

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: 2x1_section
    description: A vertical section of two pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - top_value: The value of the pixel at the top of the section.
      - has_maroon: A boolean indicating whether the section contains the value 9 (maroon).
  - object: output_pixel
    description: single pixel of the output grid.
    properties:
      - value: is the top value of the 2x1_section.
        
actions:
  - name: divide_into_sections
    description: The input grid is divided into 2x1 vertical sections.
  - name: map_top_value
    description: The value of each section is the top value of the pixel.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into contiguous 2x1 vertical sections.
2.  **Map:** For each 2x1 section, the output pixel value is equal to the value of the top pixel in that section.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
