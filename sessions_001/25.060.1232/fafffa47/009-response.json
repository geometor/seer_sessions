The colors in the input are primarily white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1), while the output contains white (0) and red (2).  There's a clear reduction in size and a change in colors. The input grid seems to be divided or partitioned into two subgrids of size 3x3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

No values from this section map to non-white values in the output grid\n\n4. **Combine**: There is only one 3 x 3 grid produced, comprised of only the results of processing the upper subgrid. The output of processing the lower subgrid is discarded.\n\nIn summary: The 6x3 input grid is reduced into a 3x3 ouput grid. The upper subgrid dictates the output colors, maroon (9) becomes red(2). The lower subgrid is discarded.\n"
