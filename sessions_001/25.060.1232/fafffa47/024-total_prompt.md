Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves compressing the input grid vertically by a factor of two and mapping colors. Each pair of rows in the input becomes a single row in the output. Maroon (9) is mapped to red (2), blue(1) to white(0), and white (0) remains white (0).

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height = input_height // 2
    output_width = input_width
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

            val2 = input_grid[2*i + 1, j]

            if val1 == 9 or val2 == 9:
                output_grid[i,j] = 2 # maroon becomes red
            elif val1 == 1 or val2 == 1:
                output_grid[i,j] = 0 # blue becomes white

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation rule to the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code captures the vertical compression by a factor of two and implements a basic color mapping. However, the results indicate that the color mapping logic is incomplete and needs adjustment. The original description oversimplified the conditions for color changes. It needs refinement to better represent the dependencies.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to how colors in adjacent rows of the input determine the color in the corresponding output row. We need to determine the exact conditions that cause a pixel in the output to be red, white, or to keep original value.
2.  **Metrics and Reporting:** Use `code_execution` to generate precise reports about the input and output grids, helping pinpoint discrepancies.
3.  **Refined YAML and Natural Language Program:** Update both the YAML documentation and the natural language program to reflect the more accurate and complete transformation rule.

**Metrics and Reporting (using code_execution):**

```python
def grid_report(grid, name="Grid"):
    report = f"{name}:\n"
    report += f"  Shape: {grid.shape}\n"
    report += f"  Unique Values: {np.unique(grid)}\n"

    # count of each value
    for value in np.unique(grid):
        count = np.count_nonzero(grid == value)
        report += f"  Count of {value}: {count}\n"

    return report

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml

  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: variable, even
      width: variable
      colors: [0, 1, 9] # White, Blue, Maroon
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: input_grid.height / 2
      width: input_grid.width
      colors: [0, 2] # White, Red
  - action: compress_vertically
    description: The input grid is compressed vertically by a factor of 2.
    details: Each pair of consecutive rows in the input becomes one row in the output.
  - action: map_colors
    description: Colors are mapped based on the values in the two input rows.
    details: |
      If either of the two corresponding input pixels is Maroon (9), the output pixel is Red (2).
      Otherwise, the output is white (0)

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Vertical Compression:** The input grid is compressed vertically by a factor of two. Every two consecutive rows in the input grid are combined to produce a single row in the output grid.
2.  **Color Mapping:** For each column, examine the two pixels from the two consecutive input rows.
    *   If *either* of the input pixels is Maroon (9), the corresponding output pixel is Red (2).
    *   Otherwise, if either of the two corresponding input pixels is Blue(1), then the corresponding output pixels is White(0).
    *    Otherwise, the output is white (0).

The predicted output of training set example 2 indicates that the last condition is correct: Otherwise output is white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
