```python
"""
The input grid is compressed vertically by a factor of two. Every two consecutive rows in the input grid are combined to produce a single row in the output grid. For each column, examine the two pixels from the two consecutive input rows. If either of the input pixels is Maroon (9), the corresponding output pixel is Red (2). Otherwise, the output is white (0).

    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height = input_height // 2

            if val1 == 9 or val2 == 9:
                output_grid[i,j] = 2 # maroon becomes red
            else:
                output_grid[i,j] = 0 # otherwise white

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single training example. While it correctly identified the vertical compression and the conditional color change (Maroon to Red), it seems to have missed a crucial detail that other colors also trigger this change. The first example was simple and the current description can't be correct for all the cases. The code did not pass all tests. We need to refine the rule to accurately reflect the transformation present in all training examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will meticulously examine each input-output pair, focusing on the pixel values in the input rows that contribute to a single output row.
2.  **Identify Trigger Condition:** The core task is to determine the exact condition that triggers the change to Red (2) in the output. The current rule (either pixel is Maroon) is too narrow.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Based on the refined trigger condition, I will rewrite the natural language program to be comprehensive and accurate.
4. **YAML documentation:** I will summarize observations.

**Metrics and Example Analysis (using a conceptual approach, as code execution isn't directly available here):**

Let's conceptually analyze what code execution would reveal, focusing on the failing tests:

*   **Example 1:** (Passed) Input had maroon, output was red. Consistent with original observation.
*   **Example 2:** (Failed) Expected the output to contain Red (2), but the function returned all white (0) because there are no 9s. This reveals that other colors must also trigger a transformation to Red. We observe that the input has Red (2), Magenta(6), and Green (3) that match up with Red pixels in the output.
*   **Example 3:** (Failed) Expected that output contains Red(2), but the function returned all white(0) since there are no 9s. This, combined with example 2, solidifies our understanding that we have an incomplete rule. We observe in this example, the same pattern from example 2: Red, Magenta, and Green match up with Red output pixels.

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: variable
      width: variable
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: input_grid.height // 2
      width: input_grid.width
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - action: compress_vertically
    description: Combine two consecutive input rows into one output row.
  - action: conditional_color_change
    description: >
      If either of the two input pixels being combined is Red(2), Magenta(6),
      Green(3), or Maroon(9), the output pixel is Red(2).
      Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).
    trigger:
      input_pixels: [2, 3, 6, 9]
    result: 2 #red
  - action: default_white
    description: If the trigger colors are not in the combined input rows, the output row's pixels are white
    trigger:
        input_pixels_not_in: [2,3,6,9]
    result: 0 #white
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is compressed vertically by a factor of two. Each pair of consecutive rows in the input grid is combined to form a single row in the output grid. For each column, consider the two pixels from the two consecutive input rows. If either of these input pixels is Red (2), Magenta (6), Green (3), or Maroon (9), the corresponding output pixel becomes Red (2). Otherwise, the output pixel becomes White (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
