The input grid contains a seemingly random arrangement of azure (8), white (0), and red (2) pixels. The output is a single white (0) pixel. The core task appears to be summarizing, counting or otherwise reducing the input grid into one value, based on color and potentially spatial arrangement.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
