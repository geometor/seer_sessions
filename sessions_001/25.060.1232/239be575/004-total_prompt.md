**input:**
```
0 0 8 0 8
2 2 8 0 0
2 2 0 0 8
0 0 0 2 2
8 8 0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7CE41A795750>

**output:**
```
0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41A797350>
Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations in the requested format.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid containing digits 0, 2, and 8, which correspond to white, red, and azure colors, respectively. The output is a single cell containing the digit 0 (white). It seems likely that the transformation involves some kind of summarization or aggregation of the input grid's contents, potentially counting or performing other operations with certain colors and resulting in a single value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description:
  input:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
      - value: 8
        color: azure
    objects:
      - description: colored pixels
        properties:
            - color: white, red, or azure
  output:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
  transformation:
    type: summarization # Hypothesis
    details: "The input is a grid.  The output is the total number of red (2) pixels minus the total number of azure (8) pixels. The absolute value of the result."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Count the number of red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Count the number of azure (value 8) pixels in the input grid.
3. Subtract the count of azure pixels from the count of red pixels and store the result.
4. Take the absolute value of that result
5.  Create a 1x1 output grid.
6.  Set the value of the single cell in the output grid to the result, or to 0 if the calculated value is negative (although it could be absolute).

Based on the description provided, the natural language program is complete and can calculate the result of the provided input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
