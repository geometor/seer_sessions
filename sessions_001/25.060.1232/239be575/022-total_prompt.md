**input:**

**output:**

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE4233084D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of numbers (representing colors), and the output is a single number (also representing a color). The input grid contains a seemingly random arrangement of azure (8), white (0), and red (2) pixels. The output is a single white (0) pixel. The core task appears to be summarizing, counting or otherwise reducing the input grid into one value, based on color and potentially spatial arrangement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_type: reduction
input_type: grid
output_type: single_value
input_colors: [8, 0, 2] # azure, white, red
output_color: [0] # white
input_dimensions: [6, 7]
output_dimensions: [1, 1]
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [8, 0, 2]
      position: (row, col)
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
actions:
  - type: count
    description: Count the occurrences of each color.
  - type: reduce
    description:  Condense the entire grid information into a single value.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of pixels of each distinct color (azure, white, and red) present in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Output:** The output is white (0). It is possible the problem will use the counts as conditions to determine the output. Since this is just one example, at present it looks like the program should be `return 0`


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
