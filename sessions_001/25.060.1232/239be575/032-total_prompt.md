Previous Code:
```python
"""
Counts a specific feature (currently unknown due to limited examples) in the input grid 
and returns 0 as the output. The specific feature likely involves the interaction
between azure (8), white (0), and red (2) regions.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid - single value of 0
    output_grid = np.array([[0]])

    # Count occurrences of '0' (white) pixels. This is a placeholder and likely
    # needs adjustment after viewing more training examples.  The single example
    # suggests a count might be involved, but the actual rule is unknown.
    # white_count = np.sum(input_grid == 0)

    # Other counting or feature detection logic would go here, based on further examples.

    return output_grid

```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial `transform` function against the training examples and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a very limited understanding, essentially a guess based on the first example. It hypothesized that counting something (white pixels, as a placeholder) might be relevant and that the output was always 0.  The additional examples clearly show this is incorrect. The outputs are not always 0, and simply counting white pixels won't work.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Observation:** I'll meticulously examine each input/output pair, focusing on:
    *   Object identification (shapes, colors, sizes).
    *   Spatial relationships (adjacency, containment, position).
    *   Changes between input and output (additions, removals, movements, color changes).
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:**  I'll use the observations to iteratively refine the transformation rule hypothesis. The first guess was clearly wrong, so I need to discard it and look for new patterns. I will keep the `output_grid = np.array([[0]])` until I see enough evidence that the shape or initialization needs to change.
3.  **Metric Gathering:** I will use code execution to verify observations and to generate quantifiable data about each example. I will also report the results of each input and expected output.
4.  **YAML Documentation:** Create structured observations about properties and actions.
5.  **Natural Language Program:** Formulate a clear, concise description of the transformation rule, taking all the example pairs into account.

**Metric Gathering and Results**
I will create several helper functions and variables to get the results.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
