<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7CE41B94CC50>

**output:**
```

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B8FC850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 6x6 grid containing digits representing different colors (as per the provided color map). The output is a single digit, '0'. The prominent colors in the input grid are azure (8), white (0), and red (2). There appears to be some interaction between the different colored regions/objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [1,2], [0,5], [2,4], [3,2], [3,4], [4,5], [5,1], [5,2], [5,4]]
      - color: white (0)
        positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1], [1,5], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2], [2,3], [2,5], [3,3], [4,2], [4,3], [5,0], [5,3], [5,5]]
      - color: red (2)
        positions: [[0,3], [0,4], [1,3], [1,4], [3,0], [3,1], [4,0], [4,1]]

  - type: single_cell
    value: 0
    color: white

actions:
    - type: count
      description: "Possible counting of certain patterns of colors."

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Colors are adjacent to each other, forming distinct regions."
  - type: containment
    description: "Not applicable - output doesn't show any containment."
  - possibly: counting

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe the Input Grid:** Examine the 6x6 input grid, noting the distribution of colors azure (8), white (0), and red (2).

2.  **Count a specific feature**: Determine if there's a specific feature relating to the position, counts, or some combination of azure, white, and red regions that corresponds to a count.

3.  **Output**: The result of the count, or computation, is a single cell, with color white(0).

Based on this single example, it is highly likely that the output is a count. Specifically looking at the input, there are:
- 11 azure pixels
- 15 white pixels
- 8 red pixels

and different shapes and combinations for each. Without more examples it hard to say for sure how the output of `0` is arrived at. It could be related to objects being inside or overlapping with other object, or a combination.

It is critical to see the other examples to derive the pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
