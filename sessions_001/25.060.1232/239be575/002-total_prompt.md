**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves input grids containing pixels of three colors: white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The output is always a single pixel, either white (0) or azure (8). The key seems to be identifying a dominant color or a color that meets a specific condition within the input grid. There isn't any obvious geometric transformation or object manipulation. Instead the relationship between all of the different colors present in the input is used to produce the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red, azure]
      - values: [0, 2, 8]
  - name: output_pixel
    type: single cell
    properties:
      - colors: [white, azure]
      - values: [0, 8]

observations:
  - example_1:
    input_colors: {white: 14, red: 6, azure: 5}
    output: white
  - example_2:
    input_colors: {white: 17, red: 6, azure: 12}
    output: azure
 - example_3:
    input_colors: { white: 14, red: 6, azure:16}
    output: azure
 - example_4:
    input_colors: {white: 16, red: 6, azure: 14}
    output: white
 - example_5:
   input_colors: {white: 17, red: 6, azure: 13}
   output: azure
 - example_6:
   input_colors: {white: 15, red: 6, azure: 10}
   output: white

relationships:
  - The output color is present in the input grid.
  - The output color is either white or azure.

actions:
  - Count the number of occurrences of each color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the input grid:** Count the number of pixels of each color (white, red, and azure).
2.  **Determine the output:**
    *   If the count of azure pixels is greater than or equal to 11, the output is azure (8).
    *   Otherwise, the output is white (0).

The logic appears to be a simple thresholding based on the count of azure pixels. Red pixels are seemingly irrelevant other than preventing the azure and white counts from going higher.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
