Find Dominant Object Color: Identify the color that constitutes the largest object(s) by area. We consider not only the number of pixels with same color but also the fact they should create a large area of this color (contiguous pixels). In case of several largest areas of different colors, choose any.\n3.  Output: Create a 1x1 output grid. The single pixel's color in the output grid should be the color of the largest object found in the input grid, as defined in step 2.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies distinct objects in the grid using connected component labeling.\n    \"\"\"\n    labeled_grid, num_objects = label(grid)\n    return labeled_grid, num_objects\n\ndef get_object_sizes(labeled_grid, num_objects):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of each object.\n    \"\"\"\n    object_sizes = {}\n    for i in range(1, num_objects + 1):  # Object labels start from 1\n        object_sizes[i] = np.sum(labeled_grid == i)\n    return object_sizes\n\ndef get_object_colors(grid, labeled_grid, num_objects):\n     \"\"\"\n     Determine color of each object\n     \"\"\"\n     object_colors = {}\n     for i in range(1, num_objects+1):\n          object_colors[i] = grid[labeled_grid == i][0] #get color from any pixel of the object\n     return object_colors\n     \n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid based on the largest object's color.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Identify Objects\n    labeled_grid, num_objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Calculate object sizes\n    object_sizes = get_object_sizes(labeled_grid, num_objects)\n    \n    # Get object colors\n    object_colors = get_object_colors(input_grid, labeled_grid, num_objects)\n\n    # Find the largest object\n    largest_object_id = max(object_sizes, key=object_sizes.get)\n    \n    # Find color of largest object\n    dominant_color = object_colors[largest_object_id]\n\n    # Create 1x1 output grid with the dominant color\n    output_grid = np.array([[dominant_color]])\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
