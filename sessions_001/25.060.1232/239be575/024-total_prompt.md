**output:**

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B9E74D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers). The output appears to be a single color (also represented by a number) extracted from the input grid. The dominant colors in the input grid are azure (8), white (0), and red (2). The output is azure (8). It seems like the output might be related to the most frequent or significant color in the input, or potentially a color related to the outer edge, or based on some criteria like most isolated.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 7] # Height, Width
      cells:
        - color: 8 # Azure
          positions: [[0, 0], [0, 5], [2, 0], [3, 2], [3, 5], [4, 2], [4, 6], [5, 0], [5, 5]]
        - color: 0 # White
          positions: [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 1], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 3], [3, 4], [4, 0], [4, 1], [4, 3], [4, 5], [5, 1], [5, 4], [5,6]]
        - color: 2 # Red
          positions:  [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [4, 3], [4, 4], [5, 2], [5, 3]]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 8 # Azure

output:
    type: single_color_grid
    properties:
      color: 8
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify all unique colors** present in the input grid.
2.  **Count the occurrences** of each unique color.
3.  **Determine the color along the border of grid.**
4.   **Select one of the border colors**. In this case, select the color azure (8).
5.  **Output a 1x1 grid** with only the value 8.

Alternative hypothesis (discarded for now, but kept for consideration if further examples contradict the above):

1. Count the number of isolated groups of each color. An isolated group is one where it is not connected to other pixels of same color.
2. In this case, azure has six isolated groups, white has zero, and red has zero.
3. Select azure (8)
4.  **Output a 1x1 grid** with only the value 8.

The first program seems the most appropriate to use right now.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
