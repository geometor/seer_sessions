Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially mostly white (0). The input grid contains two azure (8) pixels. The output grid retains the azure pixels in their original positions and introduces a sequence of green (3) pixels horizontally connecting the two azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - green (3)
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]

actions:
  - name: connect_azure_pixels
    description: Creates a horizontal line of green pixels between two azure pixels.
    preconditions:
      - Two azure pixels exist in the same row.
    postconditions:
      - Green pixels fill the space between the azure pixels on the same row.

relationships:
  - type: horizontal_connection
    description: Azure pixels in the same row are connected by a green line.
    participants: [azure pixel 1, azure pixel 2, green pixels]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **For each pair** of azure pixels located on the same row:
    *    **Determine** the horizontal distance (number of columns) between them.
    *    **Fill** all the grid cells between that pair with green (3) pixels.
3. Output the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
