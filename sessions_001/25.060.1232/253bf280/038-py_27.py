"""
The transformation rule is a perfect identity operation. The output grid is an exact, pixel-for-pixel copy of the input grid. This means:

1.  Dimensions: The output grid has the exact same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.
2.  Pixel Values: Each pixel in the output grid has the identical value (0-9) as the corresponding pixel in the input grid, at the same row and column position.
3.  Colors: The colors represented by the pixel values are therefore also identical and in the exact same locations.
4. No Operation: No pixels are changed, added, removed, or moved. The entire input grid is simply duplicated.

In essence, the output is a clone of the input.
