**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 8 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B8C3750>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 8 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B8C3ED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a single colored pixel (azure, represented by the number 8) at the center, surrounded by white pixels (represented by the number 0). The output grid is identical to the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: identity_transformation
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        color:
          - white (0)
          - azure (8)
        positions:
          - [0,0] - [2,2] # all positions in a 3x3 grid
properties:
  grid:
    - dimension: 3x3
  pixel:
    - color
    - position
actions:
  - name: none #no action is performed, copy
relationships:
    - spatial: The azure pixel is surrounded by white pixels.
    - input_output: The input grid is identical to the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is an identity operation. The input grid is copied directly to the output grid without any modifications. In other words, no changes are made, it's simply a replication of the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
