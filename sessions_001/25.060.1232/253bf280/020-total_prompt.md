Previous Code:
```python
"""
Copy the input grid to the output grid. For each row, find all occurrences of azure pixels ('8'). If a row contains two or more '8's, replace all pixels between and including the first and last '8' with green pixels ('3'). Ensure the '8' pixels in the identified locations remain in the output grid.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    for r in range(rows):

        indices_of_8 = np.where(input_grid[r] == 8)[0]

        # Check if there are at least two '8's in the row

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on identifying azure ('8') pixels within each row and modifying the pixels between the first and last occurrences. However, the examples reveal a nuance: The transformation *only* occurs if the azure pixels are *not* adjacent. The current code doesn't account for adjacency, leading to incorrect transformations when azure pixels are next to each other. My strategy will be to incorporate a check for adjacency of the azure pixels before applying the fill operation.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the specifics, I'll use `code_execution` in a hypothetical sense to generate information for each example. Since I'm in the "dreamer" phase, I'm outlining how I would use the tools rather than directly executing the code.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input Shape: (3, 5)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 5)
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 1: Indices [1, 3] (Non-adjacent) -> Transformation Applied
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 2: None -> No Transformation
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 3: Index [2] (Single) -> No Transformation

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *    Output Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 1: None -> No transformation
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 2: Indices [1,2] (Adjacent) -> Transformation should NOT have happened.
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 3: Index [2] (Single) -> No transformation
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 4: Indices [0, 4] (Non-adjacent) -> transformation applied.
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 5: Indices [2,3] (Adjacent) -> Transformation should NOT have happened.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
*   Input Shape: (7, 7)
*   Output Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Azure Pixels in Row 1: Indices [3,4,5] (Adjacent) -> Transformation should NOT have happened.
    *   Azure Pixels in other rows are all single, so correctly, no transformation.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - name: azure_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      row_index: integer
      column_index: integer
  - name: green_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      color: green (3)

actions:
  - name: find_azure_pixels
    description: Locate all azure pixels within a row.
    input: row (1D array)
    output: list of column indices

  - name: check_adjacency
    description: Determine if any two azure pixels in a list are adjacent.
    input: list of column indices
    output: boolean (True if adjacent, False otherwise)

  - name: fill_between
    description: Replace pixels between two non-adjacent azure pixels with green pixels, keeping the azure pixels.
    input: row (1D array), start_index, end_index
    output: modified row (1D array)

  - name: transform_row
      description: combines actions to apply transformation logic for each row, only if the row has at least two non-adjacent azure pixels.
      input: row
      output: modified row

  - name: transform_grid
      description: transforms each row in the grid
      input: input grid
      output: transformed output grid
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Input:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Iterate Rows:** For each row in the grid:
    a. **Find Azure:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the current row.
    b. **Check for at Least Two:** If there are fewer than two azure pixels, proceed to the next row.
    c. **Check Adjacency:** If there are two or more, check if *any* of the azure pixels are adjacent (i.e., their column indices differ by 1).
    d. **Conditional Fill:** If and *only if* there are at least two azure pixels and they are *not* adjacent, replace all pixels between (and including) the first and last azure pixels with green (3) pixels. Ensure the azure pixels themselves remain azure.
3. **Return:** After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
