Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Azure Pixels:** Identify all pixels in the input grid that are colored azure (8).
2.  **Count Azure Pixels:** Determine the number of azure pixels found.
3.  **Determine Green Line Column:** The green line will be drawn in the same column as the azure pixels.
4.  **Determine Green line length and position:** The green line will have a height equal to the number of azure pixels, bound by the grid size.
5.  **Draw Green Line:** Create a vertical line of green (3) pixels in the output grid. The line's length is equal to the number of azure pixels found in the input. The line is in the same column as the azure pixels, and it should stay within the bounds of the output grid.
6. **No Azure Pixels:** If no azure pixels are found, return a copy of the input grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
