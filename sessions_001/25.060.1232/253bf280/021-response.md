Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, most of which are white (value 0). There are two key colors/values present: azure (8) and green (3). The azure pixels appear to define "anchor points", and the green pixels form a vertical line between them. The output grid retains the azure pixels in their original positions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - green (3)
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]

actions:
  - name: identify_anchors
    description: Locate azure (8) pixels.
  - name: draw_line
    description: Create a vertical line of green (3) pixels between the azure anchors.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Azure pixels act as boundaries for the green line.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Anchors:** Find all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Maintain Anchors:** Keep the locations and the value of azure pixels in the result.
3.  **Draw Vertical Line:** For each *pair* of vertically aligned pixels, if found, between their row positions, change the value to 3.

In simpler terms: Find the azure pixels. Keep the azure pixels in the output. Draw a green vertical line between vertically aligned azure pixels.
