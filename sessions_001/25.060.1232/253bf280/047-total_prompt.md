Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Create Green Cross:** For each azure pixel:
    *   If there is not a green pixel directly above the azure, place green pixel in the grid location directly above it.
    *   Repeat for the locations: below, to the left and to the right.
3.  **Preserve Azure:** Maintain all existing azure pixels in their original locations, unchanged.
4. **Maintain all Zeros:** The black (0) pixels remain as they are.

In other words if there is an object composed of connected azure pixels:

1.  Maintain the initial object pixels.
2.  Expand the shape into a '+' cross like shape by adding green to each branch.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
