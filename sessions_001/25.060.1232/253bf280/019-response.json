            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on identifying azure ('8') pixels within each row and modifying the pixels between the first and last occurrences. However, the examples reveal a nuance: The transformation *only* occurs if the azure pixels are *not* adjacent. The current code doesn't account for adjacency, leading to incorrect transformations when azure pixels are next to each other. My strategy will be to incorporate a check for adjacency of the azure pixels before applying the fill operation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo better understand the specifics, I'll use `code_execution` in a hypothetical sense to generate information for each example. Since I'm in the \"dreamer\" phase, I'm outlining how I would use the tools rather than directly executing the code.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 5)\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 1: Indices [1, 3] (Non-adjacent) -> Transformation Applied\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 2: None -> No Transformation\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 3: Index [2] (Single) -> No Transformation\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *    Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 1: None -> No transformation\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 2: Indices [1,2] (Adjacent) -> Transformation should NOT have happened.\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 3: Index [2] (Single) -> No transformation\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 4: Indices [0, 4] (Non-adjacent) -> transformation applied.\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 5: Indices [2,3] (Adjacent) -> Transformation should NOT have happened.\n\n*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n*   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n*   Output Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Azure Pixels in Row 1: Indices [3,4,5] (Adjacent) -> Transformation should NOT have happened.\n    *   Azure Pixels in other rows are all single, so correctly, no transformation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: variable\n      columns: variable\n      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n  - name: azure_pixel\n    type: cell\n    properties:\n      color: azure (8)\n      row_index: integer\n      column_index: integer\n  - name: green_pixel\n    type: cell\n    properties:\n      color: green (3)\n\nactions:\n  - name: find_azure_pixels\n    description: Locate all azure pixels within a row.\n    input: row (1D array)\n    output: list of column indices\n\n  - name: check_adjacency\n    description: Determine if any two azure pixels in a list are adjacent.\n    input: list of column indices\n    output: boolean (True if adjacent, False otherwise)\n\n  - name: fill_between\n    description: Replace pixels between two non-adjacent azure pixels with green pixels, keeping the azure pixels.\n    input: row (1D array), start_index, end_index\n    output: modified row (1D array)\n\n  - name: transform_row\n      description: combines actions to apply transformation logic for each row, only if the row has at least two non-adjacent azure pixels.\n      input: row\n      output: modified row\n\n  - name: transform_grid\n      description: transforms each row in the grid\n      input: input grid\n      output: transformed output grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Copy Input:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.\n2.  **Iterate Rows:** For each row in the grid:\n    a. **Find Azure:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the current row.\n    b. **Check for at Least Two:** If there are fewer than two azure pixels, proceed to the next row.\n    c. **Check Adjacency:** If there are two or more, check if *any* of the azure pixels are adjacent (i.e., their column indices differ by 1).\n    d. **Conditional Fill:** If and *only if* there are at least two azure pixels and they are *not* adjacent, replace all pixels between (and including) the first and last azure pixels with green (3) pixels. Ensure the azure pixels themselves remain azure.\n3. **Return:** After processing all rows, return the modified output grid.\n"
