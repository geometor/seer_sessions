Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, representing colors. The input grid contains a few '8's (azure) on a background of '0's (white). The output grid retains the '8's in their original positions and introduces '3's (green) between the '8's horizontally.  The transformation appears to be limited to the rows containing the '8's.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 12x11 (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - 0: white
          - 3: green
          - 8: azure
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: fill
    properties:
      - color: 3 (green)
      - start: first occurrence of 8 in a row
      - end: last occurrence of 8 in a row
      - condition: row contains at least two 8s

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid
  - conditional: filling occurs only on rows containing multiple '8' pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Rows:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check for Multiple '8's:** For each row, check if it contains two or more pixels with the value '8'.
3.  **Locate '8's:** If the condition in step 2 is met, find the column indices of the first and last occurrences of '8' in that row.
4.  **Fill with '3's:**  In the output grid, fill all the pixels between the identified start and end column indices (inclusive) with the value '3', on the rows where the condition in step 2 is true.
5.  **Copy other values:** Copy all the other values (in this case only 8) that are within the start and end indices to the new grid. All values outside these indices should be copied over (in this case 0).

Essentially, the transformation connects the azure ('8') pixels in each row with a horizontal line of green ('3') pixels, leaving the other areas unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
