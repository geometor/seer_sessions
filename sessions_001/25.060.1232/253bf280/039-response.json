The transformation seems to involve creating a vertical line of green (3) pixels centered on the column where the azure pixels are located. The length of the green line appears related to, but different than, the distribution of azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The azure area seems to start at row index 1 and and row index 6. The green area is 4 high and is centered vertically, leaving one open cell above and below.\n4. **Draw Green line** draw green pixels in all cells identified in the previous step.\n\nIn summary input azure pixels are transformed to an output green vertical line of height 4 centered on the column of the azure pixels.\n"
