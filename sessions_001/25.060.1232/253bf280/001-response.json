In this case, the azure (8) pixels appear to be the primary objects.\n*   **Transformations:** The azure objects seem to be either generating green (3) lines extending from them, or sometimes remaining unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If they cross (both exist in horizontal and vertical, fill both).\n    *   If azure pixels are not aligned, or only one azure pixel, keep the output the same as the input.\n\nThe core concept is that azure pixels, when aligned, \"bridge\" or \"connect\" by filling the intervening space with green pixels.
