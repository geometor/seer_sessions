facts:
  - task: "Set main diagonal to gray, all other cells to white."
  - objects:
      - name: grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - rows: variable
          - cols: variable
          - main_diagonal: cells where row index equals column index
  - actions:
      - description: "Iterate through each cell of the grid."
      - condition: "If the cell is on the main diagonal (row index equals column index)."
        result: "Set cell value to 5 (gray)."
      - condition: "If cell is not on main diagonal."
        result: "Set cell to 0 (white)"
  - outcome: input grid with main diagonal set to gray and the rest set to white
