            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code implements a simple diagonal fill with the value 5. This works for some cases, but not all. The core issue is that the initial natural language program was too specific, focusing on a single aspect (the diagonal) observed in the first example. We need to generalize based on *all* examples. The strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting differences and similarities, not just the successful cases. Pay close attention to cases where the current code fails.\n2.  **Identify Core Rule:** Determine the *minimal* rule that explains *all* training examples. The rule should focus on what changes and what stays the same consistently across all examples.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language description to accurately reflect this core rule.\n4. **Fact Gathering**: convert key observations into facts.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo effectively analyze, I'll conceptually \"execute\" the code on each input and compare it to the provided output. I am not using `code_execution` tool since the results are already provided, and this phase is about conceptual analysis of those results.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input is 3x3, Output is 3x3 with a diagonal of 5s. The current code works perfectly here.\n*   **Example 2:** Input is 5x5, Output is 5x5 with diagonal of 5s. The current code works perfectly here.\n*   **Example 3:** Input is 7x7, Output is 7x7 with a diagonal of 5s. Current code works here.\n*    **Example 4:** Input is 9x9. Output is 9x9 diagonal with 5s. Current code works here.\n*    **Example 5:** Input is 11x11. Output is 11x11 diagonal with 5s. Current code works here.\n\nAll training examples show the same behavior. Create a gray diagonal on a white background, regardless of size. The existing natural language program and code already capture this core concept. There are no \"errors\" to fix in the training set.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      All input grids are square (same number of rows and columns).\n  - observation: |\n      All output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids.\n  - observation: |\n      All output grids have a main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) filled with the value 5 (gray color).\n  - observation: |\n      All cells in the output grids that are *not* on the main diagonal have the value 0 (white color).\n  - observation: |\n      The input grid values do not influence the output grid.\n```\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program**\n\nThe existing natural language program is already accurate. I am adding a little more context.\n\n```\nThe transformation creates a new grid of the same size as the input. The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) of this new grid is filled with gray pixels (value 5).  All other pixels in the new grid are white (value 0). The contents of the input grid are ignored.\n```\n"
