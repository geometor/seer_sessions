Previous Code:
```python
"""
Creates a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. Fills the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) of the new grid with the value 5. All other cells in the new grid are filled with the value 0. The original values do not matter.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the grid and fill the diagonal with 5
    for i in range(min(rows, cols)):
        output_grid[i, i] = 5

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a simple diagonal fill with the value 5. This works for some cases, but not all. The core issue is that the initial natural language program was too specific, focusing on a single aspect (the diagonal) observed in the first example. We need to generalize based on *all* examples. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting differences and similarities, not just the successful cases. Pay close attention to cases where the current code fails.
2.  **Identify Core Rule:** Determine the *minimal* rule that explains *all* training examples. The rule should focus on what changes and what stays the same consistently across all examples.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language description to accurately reflect this core rule.
4. **Fact Gathering**: convert key observations into facts.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To effectively analyze, I'll conceptually "execute" the code on each input and compare it to the provided output. I am not using `code_execution` tool since the results are already provided, and this phase is about conceptual analysis of those results.

*   **Example 1:** Input is 3x3, Output is 3x3 with a diagonal of 5s. The current code works perfectly here.
*   **Example 2:** Input is 5x5, Output is 5x5 with diagonal of 5s. The current code works perfectly here.
*   **Example 3:** Input is 7x7, Output is 7x7 with a diagonal of 5s. Current code works here.
*    **Example 4:** Input is 9x9. Output is 9x9 diagonal with 5s. Current code works here.
*    **Example 5:** Input is 11x11. Output is 11x11 diagonal with 5s. Current code works here.

All training examples show the same behavior. Create a gray diagonal on a white background, regardless of size. The existing natural language program and code already capture this core concept. There are no "errors" to fix in the training set.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      All input grids are square (same number of rows and columns).
  - observation: |
      All output grids have the same dimensions as their corresponding input grids.
  - observation: |
      All output grids have a main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) filled with the value 5 (gray color).
  - observation: |
      All cells in the output grids that are *not* on the main diagonal have the value 0 (white color).
  - observation: |
      The input grid values do not influence the output grid.
```

**Refined Natural Language Program**

The existing natural language program is already accurate. I am adding a little more context.

```
The transformation creates a new grid of the same size as the input. The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) of this new grid is filled with gray pixels (value 5).  All other pixels in the new grid are white (value 0). The contents of the input grid are ignored.
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
