**input:**
```
2 2 2
3 2 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE423382450>

**output:**
```
5 0 0
0 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE423382E50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing the numbers 2 and 3, representing red and green colors, respectively. The output is also a 3x3 grid, but it contains the numbers 5 and 0, representing gray and white colors. The transformation seems to involve replacing some of the original colors with a new color (gray, 5) in a specific pattern, and the remainder are set to white (0). The specific pattern appears to be the diagonal from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Input grid contains values 2 (red) and 3 (green).
  - observation: Output grid contains values 5 (gray) and 0 (white).
  - relationship:  Values on main diagonal of input are replaced with 5 in the output.
  - relationship: All other values in input not on the main diagonal are replaced with 0 in the output.
  - object: Input grid
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - values: [2, 3]
  - object: Output grid
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - values: [5, 0]
  - action: Replace values on main diagonal with 5.
  - action: Replace other values with 0.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the main diagonal:**  Locate the cells that form a diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the input grid.
2.  **Replace Diagonal:** Change the value of all cells located on the main diagonal to 5 (gray).
3. **Replace Off-Diagonal:** Change value of the cells *not* on the main diagonal to 0 (white)
4.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
