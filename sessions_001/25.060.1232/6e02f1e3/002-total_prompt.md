**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input consists of 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.
*   **Output Grids:** The output also consists of 3x3 grids. These grids contain only the values 0 and 5, also likely representing colors (white and grey, based on the color map).
*   **Spatial Relationships:** The position of the non-zero elements in the output grid seems to relate to the input grid, but not in a simple mirroring or rotation.
*    **Diagonal Pattern** It seems a diagonal is constructed in output in some cases, otherwise, a horizontal line.
* **Color change:** All colored pixels in input are transformed to the grey color (value 5)

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0, 5)

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    input: input_grid cell value
    output: output_grid cell value (0 or 5)
  - name: determine_position
    input: input grid
    output: a pattern or a strategy to define output grid.

relationships:
    - type: input_to_output
      description: Each input grid corresponds to a specific output grid.
    - type: element_transformation
      description:  The transformation rule seem to be to check where the input grid contains non-equal neighboring pixels, and use this position.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3), initially filled with 0s.

2.  **Check input grid color pattern:**.
    *   If all pixels of input have the same color, the output is a horizontal line of grey (5) in the first row.
    *   Otherwise, put grey color (5) in the output according these rules:
        *   If the top-left pixel is different in color to both the top-center and left-center pixels, construct a diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right of grey (5) pixels.
        *    If the top-right pixel is different in color to both the top-center and right-center pixels, construct a diagonal from the top-right to bottom-left of grey (5) pixels.
        *   Otherwise, if only the colors in the first row are different, construct a diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right of grey (5) pixels.
3.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   Replace the pixels in the output grid with the gray color (5)


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
