**input:**
```
3 3 3
3 3 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B9E59D0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE423327750>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid consists entirely of green pixels (represented by the number 3). The output grid is also a 3x3 grid, but with the top row being gray (represented by the number 5) and the remaining two rows being white (represented by the number 0). The grid dimensions remain constant. The black borders are considered insignificant styling, and not a color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: The output is a 3x3 grid.
  - object: Input grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      pixels: All green (value 3)
  - object: Output grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      pixels:
        row_1: All gray (value 5)
        row_2: All white (value 0)
        row_3: All white (value 0)
  - relationship: Input grid transforms to output grid.
  - action: Change pixel colors based on row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Maintain Dimensions:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).
2.  **Top Row Transformation**: Change all pixels in the top row of the input grid to gray (value 5).
3.  **Other Rows Transformation**: Change all pixels in the remaining rows (second and third rows) of the input grid to white (value 0).
4. Preserve the dimensions.

Essentially, the transformation rule recolors the input grid based on the row index. The first row becomes gray, and all other rows become white. The core logic isolates the row index as the element of the grid to operate on.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
