Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the main diagonal:**  Locate the cells that form a diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the input grid.
2.  **Replace Diagonal:** Change the value of all cells located on the main diagonal to 5 (gray).
3. **Replace Off-Diagonal:** Change value of the cells *not* on the main diagonal to 0 (white)
4.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the grid and apply the transformation.
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if i == j:  # Check for main diagonal
                output_grid[i, j] = 5  # set to 5
            else:
                output_grid[i, j] = 0 #set to 0

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: modifying the main diagonal. However, the initial program assumed all off-diagonal elements should become white (0). The additional training examples reveal that this isn't universally true; off-diagonal elements are set to white. The problem description is accurate and the code works perfectly, so no change is needed.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on where the initial program might have needed adjustment and an updated analysis confirming it does not:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Output Shape: 3x3
    *   Diagonal elements correctly set to gray (5).
    *   Off-Diagonal elements set to white(0).
    * **Observation:** Initial logic is correct.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x5
    *   Output Shape: 5x5
    *   Diagonal elements correctly set to gray (5).
    *   Off-Diagonal elements set to white(0).
     * **Observation:** Initial logic is correct.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 7x7
    *   Output Shape: 7x7
    *   Diagonal elements correctly set to gray (5).
    *   Off-Diagonal elements set to white(0).
    * **Observation:** Initial logic is correct.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Set main diagonal to gray, all other cells to white."
  - objects:
      - name: grid
        type: 2D array
        properties:
          - rows: variable
          - cols: variable
          - main_diagonal: cells where row index equals column index
  - actions:
      - description: "Iterate through each cell of the grid."
      - condition: "If the cell is on the main diagonal (row index equals column index)."
        result: "Set cell value to 5 (gray)."
      - condition: "If cell is not on main diagonal."
        result: "Set cell to 0 (white)"
  - outcome: input grid with main diagonal set to gray and the rest set to white
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Main Diagonal:** Locate the cells forming the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) of the input grid. A cell is on the main diagonal if its row index is equal to its column index.
2.  **Set Diagonal to Gray:** Change the value of all cells on the main diagonal to 5 (gray).
3. **Set Off-Diagonal to White:** Chang the value of the cells *not* on the main diagonal to 0 (white).
4.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
