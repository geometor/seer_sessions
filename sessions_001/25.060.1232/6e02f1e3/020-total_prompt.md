    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # change output pixels 

    # Change the top row to gray (5)
    for j in range(cols):
        output_grid[0, j] = 5

    # Change the remaining rows to white (0)
    for i in range(1, rows):
        for j in range(cols):

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a simple observation: the top row becomes gray, and the rest become white. While this holds true for the first training example, it's clearly not the universal rule, as evidenced by the errors, especially in the third example. The other two examples were correct because they had solid colors, matching our overly simplistic description. We need to discern a more sophisticated pattern that accounts for the variations in the training examples.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll use code execution to inspect each input and output grid, focusing on color changes and spatial relationships that were missed in the first iteration.
2.  **Object Identification:** I will clearly define what constitutes an "object" in each example, considering contiguous regions of the same color.
3.  **Relationship Mapping:** I will analyze how these objects relate to each other and how their positions or properties change from input to output.
4.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will formulate a revised natural language program that accounts for the observed transformations accurately and generalizes across all provided training examples.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Let's use code execution to derive information about what we missed, focusing on the changes.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Top Row:** Find the topmost row of the input grid.
2.  **Top Row Transformation:** Change the color of all pixels in the top row to gray.
3.  **Identify the Bottom Row:** Find the bottommost row of the input grid.
4. **Bottom Row Transformation:** Change the color of the pixels in the bottom row to white *if the row is not the top row*.
5.  **Identify Corners:** If the corners have one color, and the top row has that same color, change all corner colors to white, *if it is not already white*.
6.  **Other Rows:** Examine all the rows that are not the top or bottom.  If a pixel is not part of the top row or bottom row, and it does not have the same value of the bottom row, and it is at the edge, make the pixel the same color as the bottom row.

This revised program accounts for the top row always turning gray. It also accounts for cases like example 3, where we have colors on the perimeter that must be set to white.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
