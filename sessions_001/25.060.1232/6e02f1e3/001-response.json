Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output also consists of 3x3 grids. These grids contain only the values 0 and 5, also likely representing colors (white and grey, based on the color map).\n*   **Spatial Relationships:** The position of the non-zero elements in the output grid seems to relate to the input grid, but not in a simple mirroring or rotation.\n*    **Diagonal Pattern** It seems a diagonal is constructed in output in some cases, otherwise, a horizontal line.\n* **Color change:** All colored pixels in input are transformed to the grey color (value 5)\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
