Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the main diagonal:**  Locate the cells that form a diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the input grid.
2.  **Replace Diagonal:** Change the value of all cells located on the main diagonal to 5 (gray).
3. **Replace Off-Diagonal:** Change value of the cells *not* on the main diagonal to 0 (white)
4.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.
"""

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through the grid and apply the transformation.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
