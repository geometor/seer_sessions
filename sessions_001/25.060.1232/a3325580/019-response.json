The input grid contains various single-digit integers, each representing a color. Distinct colored regions (objects) are present. The output grid appears to only contain the digit '2' (red). The key seems to lie in identifying a specific object or pattern in the input that relates to '2'. The presence of '2' along with other digits in the input suggest the program isn't just selecting or counting a single color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
