facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid's width corresponds to the number of distinct non-zero colors present in the input grid.
  - observation: |
      The output grid's height is equal to the number of distinct colors in the input.
  - observation: |
      Each column in the output grid represents a unique color from the input grid.
  - observation: |
      Each column is filled with the color it represents, repeated for the height of the output grid.
  - observation: |
    The input grid size is not relevant to the output grid size other than in the count of distinct colors
  - action: |
      The transformation identifies the unique non-zero colors in the input.
  - action: |
      The transformation creates an output grid where each column corresponds to a unique color.
  - action: |
      The transformation fills each column with its corresponding color, repeating the color down the column.
