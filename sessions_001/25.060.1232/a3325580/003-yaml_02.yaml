  - task: "Create columns of colors based on input."
  - example_1:
      input_colors: [2, 3]
      output_colors: [2, 3]
      output_shape: (3, 2)
      color_sequence: "Colors in the same row are grouped together"
      notes: "Output height matches rows with all colors."
  - example_2:
      input_colors: [2, 3]
      output_colors: [2, 3]
      output_shape: (4, 2)
      color_sequence: "Colors in the same row are grouped together"
      notes: "Output height matches rows with all colors."
  - example_3:
      input_colors: [2, 3]
      output_colors: [2, 3]
      output_shape: (3, 2)
      color_sequence: "Colors in the same row are grouped together"
      notes: "Output height matches rows with all colors."
  - example_4:
      input_colors: [1, 2, 3]
      output_colors: [1, 2, 3]
      output_shape: (5, 3)
      color_sequence: "Colors in the same row are grouped together. If a column has no additional colors, pad with black"
      notes: "Output height matches rows with all colors. Zero padding."
  - example_5:
      input_colors: [2, 5]
      output_colors: [2, 5]
      output_shape: (3, 2)
      color_sequence: "Colors in the same row are grouped together"
      notes: "Output height matches rows with all colors."
  - general:
    - "The output grid always contains columns for each distinct, non-zero color present in the input grid."
    - "The height is determined by matching colors across a row."
    - "If a color is not found, use the background color (black)"
