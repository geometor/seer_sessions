The output is a 3x2 grid, also with colored pixels. The colors present in the input are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The output grid only contains red and green pixels. The spatial arrangement of the colors in the input seems to be related to their appearance in the output. Specifically it looks like there are two separate colored objects, and the output grid combines them into columns.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this example, we find two objects: a red object and a green object.\n2. **Extract Colors**: Record the distinct colors of those objects, here Red (2) and Green(3).\n3. **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with dimensions based on number of objects. the height of each colored object determines height of the columns. The width will be the number of colors, in our case 2.\n4. **Arrange Colors:** Put first color in first column, second color in the second column. Repeat colors vertically down their respective columns.\n\n"
