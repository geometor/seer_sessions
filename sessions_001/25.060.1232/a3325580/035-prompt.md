Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct, connected regions (objects) of non-white pixels within the input grid. Record the color, shape, and bounding box (min/max row and column) of each object.

2. **Analyze Input-Output Relationship**: Based on example analysis:

    *   If the objects are simple and aligned vertically and of the same height, the output consists of vertical columns, each with the color of a corresponding object, and the height of each column matches the maximum height of the input objects.
    * If there is only a single object and it is L-shaped, construct the similar size of object but fill all cells by that color.
    *  If the input is a solid, single-color square, the output matches the input dimensions.
    * If input contains multiple scattered, the program is unable to generalize.

3. **Output Construction:**
      Construct grid based on rule derived in step 2.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
