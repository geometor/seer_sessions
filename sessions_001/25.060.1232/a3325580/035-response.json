            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, capturing some basic transformation patterns (vertical columns, L-shapes, and squares). However, the test results show that the logic is incomplete and fails to generalize to all cases. The primary issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Handling of Scattered Objects:** The code doesn't correctly process cases with multiple, non-aligned objects. It defaults to a 2x2 orange square, which is incorrect for most of these cases.\n2.  **Oversimplification of Rules:** The rules for vertical columns, L-shapes, and squares are too specific and don't cover variations in object arrangements and transformations.\n3. The vertical alignment constraint is too strict.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, noting the number, color, shape, position, and spatial relationships of objects *before* and *after* the transformation. I need to check rows and columns.\n2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Ensure the `find_objects` function accurately identifies all distinct objects, regardless of their shape or arrangement.\n3.  **Identify Core Transformations:** Determine the *fundamental* operations being applied. Are objects being replicated, resized, recolored, moved, or combined?\n4.  **Develop More General Rules:** Instead of specific cases (like \"L-shape\"), try to formulate rules based on object properties and relationships (e.g., \"objects of color X are expanded to fill the bounding box\").\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and code incrementally, testing against all examples after each change.\n6.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Pay attention to any unusual examples or \"exceptions\" to the general rules.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, including metrics gathered using hypothetical code execution (as actual code execution isn't possible in this environment):\n\nTo clarify the metrics, I will use the following terms:\n\n*   **Objects:** Connected regions of non-white pixels.\n*   **Bounding Box:** The smallest rectangle that encloses an object.\n* Shape - the set of cells occupied by the object\n* Contour - the perimeter of the shape - cells adjacent to a cell of a different value\n\n```python\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    input_objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    output_objects = find_objects(output_grid)\n\n    print(\"Input Objects:\")\n    for i, (color, pixels) in enumerate(input_objects):\n        rows = [p[0] for p in pixels]\n        cols = [p[1] for p in pixels]\n        min_row, max_row = min(rows), max(rows)\n        min_col, max_col = min(cols), max(cols)\n        height = max_row - min_row + 1\n        width = max_col - min_col + 1\n        print(f\"  Object {i+1}:\")\n        print(f\"    Color: {color}\")\n        print(f\"    Bounding Box: ({min_row}, {min_col}) to ({max_row}, {max_col})\")\n        print(f\"    Height: {height}, Width: {width}\")\n        print(f\"    Number of Pixels: {len(pixels)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nOutput Objects:\")\n    for i, (color, pixels) in enumerate(output_objects):\n        rows = [p[0] for p in pixels]\n        cols = [p[1] for p in pixels]\n        min_row, max_row = min(rows), max(rows)\n        min_col, max_col = min(cols), max(cols)\n        height = max_row - min_row + 1\n        width = max_col - min_col + 1\n        print(f\"  Object {i+1}:\")\n        print(f\"    Color: {color}\")\n        print(f\"    Bounding Box: ({min_row}, {min_col}) to ({max_row}, {max_col})\")\n        print(f\"    Height: {height}, Width: {width}\")\n        print(f\"    Number of Pixels: {len(pixels)}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {np.array_equal(transform(input_grid), output_grid)}\")\n\n# Hypothetical code execution for each example (using the provided example grids).\n# I've added example data here so you can imagine how this runs.
