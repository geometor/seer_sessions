Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain several distinct colored regions: yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), and maroon (9), with a significant presence of white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, retaining only certain colors and seemingly focusing on the lower-right quadrant of the input grid. The colors in output corresponds to the non-white colors in input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 4, 5, 6, 9]
      - dimensions: 8x8
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [5, 6, 9]
      - dimensions: 4x4
  - name: yellow_region
    type: object
    color: 4
    location: top-left
  - name: grey_region
    type: object
    color: 5
    location: top-right
  - name: magenta_region
    type: object
    color: 6
    location: bottom-left
    shape: L
  - name: maroon_region
    type: object
    color: 9
    location: bottom-right

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: [yellow_region, grey_region, magenta_region, maroon_region]
  - type: corresponds_to
    from: output_grid
    to: input_grid

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Select non-zero color values.
  - type: cropping
    description: Focus on the lower-right quadrant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Examine the input grid and identify contiguous regions of the same non-zero color. Treat these as distinct objects.
2. **Focus Area** Extract a sub-grid that is size 4x4 aligned with colors from the bottom right of input.
3.  **Preserve Colors:** Within the selected area, remove all white(0) colors.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid from what is left.

In essence, the transformation extracts the bottom-right 4x4 non-zero colored subgrid from input and presents in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
