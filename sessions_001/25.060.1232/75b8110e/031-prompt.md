"""
1. **Identify Color Regions:** Examine the input grid and identify contiguous regions of the same color, focusing on colors 0 (white), 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), and 9 (maroon).

2. **Detect Intersections:** Find locations where at least three *different* colored regions intersect.  An intersection is defined as a region where pixels of these different colors are adjacent (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) or in close proximity (not strictly within a 2x2 window, but within a slightly larger, flexible neighborhood).

3. **Determine Output Grid and Pixel Placement:** The output grid's size and pixel placement are determined by the *locations* of the detected intersections. Each significant intersection will correspond to a pixel in the output grid. The precise mapping from intersection location to output pixel location may not be a simple stride, but rather a correspondence based on the overall distribution of intersections.

4. **Assign Output Pixel Colors:** For each intersection found, place a pixel in the corresponding location in the output grid. The color of this output pixel is one of the colors present at the intersection. Specifically, examine a 2x2 window on the input, locate the upper-left most pixel of that 2x2 window that participates in the intersection, and set that value at the output pixel.

5. The output grid size is not simply half of the input size. It is dynamically sized by finding the intersections.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
