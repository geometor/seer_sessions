Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The input grid appears to have distinct regions or objects of different colors, while the output grid seems to be a condensed or summarized version, potentially highlighting intersections or interactions between these regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, look for regions of colors 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), and 9 (maroon). Also of interest are areas of 0 (white).\n\n2. **Focus on Intersections:** The output grid focuses on locations that show a 2x2 region where at least 3 different color regions intersect in the input, in the form of a cross or plus pattern.\n\n3. **Construct Output:** Create an output grid by iterating in 2x2 windows through the input grid. If a cross pattern interaction/intersection occurs, record those colors. The color in each cell is the color that occurs on the cross pattern.\n\n4. The size of the output grid appears to be the result of applying the 2 x 2 window and sliding it 2 cells at at time (stride=2).\n"
