task: 7b6017b4
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 15x15, 17x17)
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - colors_present: [0, 4, 5, 6, 9]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, not a fixed function of input dimensions
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - object: color_region
    type: contiguous_area
    properties:
        - color: integer (0-9)
        - shape: irregular

  - relation: intersection
    type: spatial
    properties:
      - participants: [color_region, color_region, color_region] (at least three)
      - condition: "pixels of different colors are adjacent or in close proximity"
      - output_effect:  "a pixel of a specific color is placed in the output grid"
      - output_color_selection: "The color placed is one of the colors in the intersection"
      - proximity_rule: "within a flexible neighborhood, not just a 2x2 square"

  - process: transformation
    steps:
      - 1: "Identify color regions in the input grid."
      - 2: "Detect intersections of at least three different color regions."
      - 3: "Determine output grid dimensions based on intersection locations."
      - 4: "Place pixels in the output grid at locations corresponding to intersections."
      - 5: "The output pixel's color is determined by the color of the intersection."
