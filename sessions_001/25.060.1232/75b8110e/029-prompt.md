"""
1. **Identify Color Regions:** In the input grid, locate distinct regions formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. Specifically, look for regions of colors 4 (yellow), 5 (gray), 6 (magenta), and 9 (maroon). Also of interest are areas of 0 (white).

2. **Focus on Intersections:** The output grid focuses on locations that show a 2x2 region where at least 3 different color regions intersect in the input, in the form of a cross or plus pattern.

3. **Construct Output:** Create an output grid by iterating in 2x2 windows through the input grid. If a cross pattern interaction/intersection occurs, record those colors. The color in each cell is the color that occurs on the cross pattern.

4. The size of the output grid appears to be the result of applying the 2 x 2 window and sliding it 2 cells at at time (stride=2).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
