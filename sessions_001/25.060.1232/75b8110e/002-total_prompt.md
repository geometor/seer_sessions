<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2752x848 at 0x7CE41A7956D0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided task examples:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input grid of colored pixels into a smaller output grid. The colors present are yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), maroon (9), and white (0). The output grids seem to be a condensed representation of the input grids, focusing on specific color arrangements. It appears that the transformation isn't a simple sub-sampling or direct mapping of regions. There's a re-arrangement of colors involved, indicating a more complex rule than mere compression. The consistent 4x4 size of the output grids is a notable feature. The white (0) pixels in the input seem to often, but not always, disappear in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: variable (e.g., 8x8)
        elements: pixels
        element_properties:
            - color: [0, 4, 5, 6, 9] #white, yellow, gray, magenta, maroon
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 4x4
        elements: pixels
        element_properties:
          - color: [0, 4, 5, 6, 9]

actions:
  - name: condense
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Transforms the input grid into a 4x4 output grid.

relationships:
   - type: spatial_transformation
     description: The output grid is a spatially transformed representation of the input_grid. There is not direct one-to-one subregion mapping

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Key Colors:** Within the input grid, focus on the non-white (non-0) colored pixels. Treat white (0) pixels as background or separators.
2. **Color Grouping and Arrangement** : Examine the four non-zero colored pixels in the top-left area, note colors. Repeat to get three more groups of four, moving to the right, and then start at the left, one row down.
3. **Condense and Rearrange, Top Left Quadrant** : Create the top-left cell of the output grid using a color from among the first four colors in a consistent order.
4. **Condense and Rearrange, Top Right Quadrant** Create the top-right cell of the output grid using the color that follows the first in the four colors, in a consistent order.
5. **Condense and Rearrange, All** : Create the entire output grid using the patterns of colors and their consistent ordering.
6. **Output Grid**: The final result is a 4x4 grid containing a condensed and rearranged representation of the key color features from the input grid.

Essentially, the program extracts the color information, ignoring their precise coordinates, groups them, and reconstructs a 4x4 output with the essential non-background color information.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
