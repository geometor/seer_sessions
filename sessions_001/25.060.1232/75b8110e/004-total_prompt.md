Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the perceived transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** An 8x8 grid with colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9). There appear to be distinct regions or "objects" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color.
*   **Output:** A 4x4 grid, also with colored pixels. The output seems to be a compressed or abstracted representation of the input, maintaining some, but not all, of the original colors and spatial relationships. It appears like a 2x2 block has been sampled and reduced to a single pixel, with no consistent choice of which input cell.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: [8, 8]
      output: [4, 4]
    elements: pixels
    element_properties:
      color: [yellow, white, gray, magenta, maroon]

actions:
  - type: compression
    method: block_reduction
    block_size: [2, 2]
    selection: inconsistent #observed that the output pixel does not consistently represent any particular pixel (top-left, top-right, etc.) within the 2x2 input block.

relationships:
    - type: spatial_reduction
      description: Each 2x2 block in the input grid corresponds to a single pixel in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into 2x2 blocks of pixels. There will be a total of (8/2) * (8/2) = 16 such blocks.
2.  **Reduce:** For each 2x2 block in the input, select the a single pixel, the selection is not consistent between cells.
3.  **Construct:** Create a new 4x4 output grid. Each pixel's location will corespond to its equivalent 2x2 block. Place the selected pixels in the output grid accordingly.

The key here is recognizing the 2x2 block reduction. The challenge is the inconsistent selection.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
