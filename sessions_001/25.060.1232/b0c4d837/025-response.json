The additional training examples reveal that this isn't the case. The output grid's size and content are more dynamic and depend on the *number* of a certain type of object, not just the presence of azure.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The initial code focused solely on azure pixels. We need to shift focus to identify the relevant *objects* that dictate the output.  The provided code execution results reveal that counting a particular kind *object* (contiguous regions of a single color) determines the output grid dimensions.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Output Size:** The 3x3 output grid assumption is incorrect. The output grid size appears to be directly related to the number of the key objects counted.\n\n3.  **Content Beyond Azure:** The output isn't solely composed of azure pixels.  The value of the counted objects needs to be captured and transferred.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**\n\nI'll use `code_execution` to get precise metrics for each example. I'll focus on counting objects and their color, comparing input and output grid sizes.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_objects(grid):\n
