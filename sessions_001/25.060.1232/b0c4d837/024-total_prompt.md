Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extracts the azure (8) colored pixels from the input grid and places them into a new 3x3 grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Find azure (8) pixels
    azure_pixels = []
    for r_idx, row in enumerate(input_grid):
        for c_idx, pixel in enumerate(row):
            if pixel == 8:
                azure_pixels.append((r_idx, c_idx))

    # Fill the output grid with azure pixels, row by row. stops when 3x3 grid is full.
    count = 0
    for r in range(3):
      for c in range(3):
        if count < len(azure_pixels):
            output_grid[r][c] = 8
            count +=1

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved extracting azure pixels and placing them in a 3x3 grid. The core logic of identifying azure pixels is correct. However, the initial program fails to capture the complete rule, as evidenced by the errors in other examples. The initial code has hard-coded size 3x3, which may not be true across tasks.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Examine each input-output pair, focusing on how the azure pixels are positioned in the output relative to the input.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns in how the azure pixels are extracted and arranged. Pay attention to:
    *   The number of azure pixels extracted.
    *   The spatial arrangement in the output (e.g., are they clustered, spread out, forming a specific shape?).
    *   The overall size and shape of the output grid.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the identified patterns, update the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**

Here's a breakdown of each example and observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 6x9
    *   Output Shape: 3x3
    *   Azure Pixel Count (Input): 9
    *   Azure Pixel Count (Output):9
    *   Result: Pass

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 10x14
    *   Output Shape: 3x3
    *   Azure Pixel Count (Input): 6
    *   Azure Pixel Count (Output): 6
    *   Result: Pass

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 15x14
    *   Output Shape: 3x3
    *   Azure Pixel Count (Input): 2
    *    Azure Pixel Count (Output): 2
    *   Result: Pass

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task:
  input_grid_properties:
    - variable_size: true
    - contains_azure_pixels: true
  output_grid_properties:
    - size: 3x3
    - contains_only_azure_pixels_from_input: true
  transformation_rules:
    - extract_azure_pixels: true
    - output_grid_size_is_fixed: "3x3"
    - arrange_azure_pixels_in_output: true
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels with the color azure (value 8) in the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** Extract the azure colored pixels.
3.  **Create:** Create a new 3x3 grid.
4. **Arrange:** Fill new grid with azure colored pixels, row by row.
5.  **Output:** Return the new grid. If there are fewer azure pixels than grid
    cells, the remaining cells will be filled with black (value 0, which the
    code does by default).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
