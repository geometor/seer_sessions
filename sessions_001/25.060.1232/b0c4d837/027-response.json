The input grid appears to have a central \"object\" composed of gray (5) and azure (8) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid is smaller and contains only a single azure (8) pixel and many white (0) pixels. The key seems to be isolating a specific feature (the azure pixels) from the input and representing it in a different, smaller grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
