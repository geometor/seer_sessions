Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a central "object" composed of gray (5) and azure (8) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid is smaller and contains only a single azure (8) pixel and many white (0) pixels. The key seems to be isolating a specific feature (the azure pixels) from the input and representing it in a different, smaller grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 5, 8]
      shape: 6x5 (width x height)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0, 8]
      shape: 3x3
  - name: core_object
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      colors: [8]
      shape: variable
    relationships:
      - contained_in: input_grid
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: extract_and_resize
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core:** Find the contiguous block of azure (8) colored pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** Isolate the minimum bounding rectangle that fully encloses the azure core.
3. **Translate**: Take the value in the upper left corner of the identified rectangle.
4. **Resize:** create a 3x3 grid filled with value '0'.
5. **place**: place the value from step 3, into the upper left corner of the new grid.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the azure (8) pixels, determines the smallest rectangle that covers these, takes the value of the upper left position and places this value in the new grid of 0s.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
