**input:**

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 6x6 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains digits representing colors (0: white, 5: grey, 8: azure). The output grid contains only azure (8) and white (0) colors. The azure pixels in the input grid appear to be the focus of the transformation. There's a clear reduction in size, and a seeming extraction of a specific colored region.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 6x6
      output: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [white, grey, azure]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        grey: 5
        azure: 8
      location: [row, column]

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: "Extracting a subgrid based on color and position."

  - type: resizing/cropping
    description: change dimensions of grid

relationships:
  - input_grid contains pixels
  - output_grid contains pixels
  - azure_pixels in input_grid relate to azure_pixels in output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) that encloses all the identified azure pixels.
3.  **Extraction:** Extract the sub-grid defined as follows.
    *   The top row of the sub-grid should be the row that contains the azure pixels.
    *   The sub-grid should have 3 columns, starting from the first column containing azure.
4. **Output Construction:** The extracted sub-grid and resize/crop it to a 3x3, keeping only original pixels in the process.

In simpler terms: Find the azure pixels, draw a box around them. Get one row of the box and resize everything to 3x3.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
