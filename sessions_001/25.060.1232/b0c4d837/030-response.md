1.  **Locate Value:** Find the pixel value located at the 5th column (index 4) in the input grid. The specific row will change depending on where the non-zero pixel is, starting from top to bottom.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 grid filled with 0s.
3.  **Place value:** Place the value identified in step 1 into the top-left cell (position [0, 0]) of the output grid.
4. output the new grid.
