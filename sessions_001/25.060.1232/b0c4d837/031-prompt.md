Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Value:** Find the pixel value located at the 5th column (index 4) in the input grid. The specific row will change depending on where the non-zero pixel is, starting from top to bottom.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 grid filled with 0s.
3.  **Place value:** Place the value identified in step 1 into the top-left cell (position [0, 0]) of the output grid.
4. output the new grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Create a 3x3 output grid filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the rows of the 5th column (index 4)
    for row in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
      value = input_grid[row, 4]
      if value !=0:
        # Place the located value in the top-left corner of the output grid.
        output_grid[0, 0] = value
        break #stop after first non zero value


    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
