The input grid contains digits representing colors (0: white, 5: grey, 8: azure). The output grid contains only azure (8) and white (0) colors. The azure pixels in the input grid appear to be the focus of the transformation. There's a clear reduction in size, and a seeming extraction of a specific colored region.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
