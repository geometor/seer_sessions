Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x7 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains three distinct colors: white (0), gray (5), and azure (8).  The output grid contains only azure (8) and white (0). The azure pixels in the input seem to correspond to the azure pixels in the output. The gray pixels in the input seem to define a boundary or container around the azure pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: gray
        value: 5
      - color: azure
        value: 8
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: azure
        value: 8
  - observation: azure_region
    description: A contiguous region of azure pixels exists within the input grid.
  - observation: gray_outline
    description: gray pixels surround or outline the azure shape, forming an upside down U shape
  - action: extraction
    description: The azure region is extracted from the input grid.
  - action: size_reduction
    description: the size is significantly reduced from the input to output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels within the input grid. This region is enclosed or surrounded by gray (5) pixels that form an upside-down "U" shape.
2.  **Extract the Bounding Box:** Determine minimum bounding box of the azure region.
3.  **Output the Azure Region:** Create new grid using only the bounding box of the azure pixels.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
