Previous Code:
```python
"""
Counts the number of azure (8) pixels in the input grid and outputs the count as a 1x1 grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by counting all azure pixels.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A 1x1 grid containing the count of azure pixels.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Count all azure pixels
    azure_count = np.count_nonzero(input_array == 8)

    # Create the 1x1 output grid with the count.
    output_grid = [[azure_count]]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly counted azure pixels. However, it's clear from the other training examples that the rule isn't universally applicable. It works for some but not all. The core issue is that the transformation isn't *always* about counting azure pixels. We need to identify the common thread among all successful transformations and pinpoint the conditions under which different rules apply. My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Examine the input and output grids for each training example, not just those where the initial code failed. Pay close attention to the colors and spatial relationships.
2.  **Identify Alternative Rules:** Look for other possible transformations beyond simply counting azure pixels.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Consider if the correct transformation depends on certain conditions present in the input grid.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to reflect a more general and accurate rule, incorporating any identified conditions.

**Metrics and Observations via Code Execution**

I'll use `code_execution` to get precise details on the input and output grids. I'll focus on:

*   Dimensions of input and output grids.
*   Pixel counts for each color in both input and output.
*   Verification of the current code's output against the expected output.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    predicted_output_grid = np.array(predicted_output_grid)
    
    input_dims = input_grid.shape
    output_dims = output_grid.shape
    
    input_color_counts = {color: np.count_nonzero(input_grid == color) for color in range(10)}
    output_color_counts = {color: np.count_nonzero(output_grid == color) for color in range(10)}

    match = np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_output_grid)

    report = {
        "input_dimensions": input_dims,
        "output_dimensions": output_dims,
        "input_color_counts": input_color_counts,
        "output_color_counts": output_color_counts,
        "prediction_match": match
    }
    return report
train_reports = []
for idx, example in enumerate(task["train"]):
  predicted_output = transform(example["input"])
  report = analyze_example(example["input"], example["output"], predicted_output)
  train_reports.append({"example":idx, **report})

print(train_reports)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
