**input:**
```
8 0 8
0 8 0
8 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B94CE50>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE423380550>
Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid. The grid contains two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The azure pixels form a symmetrical pattern around the center.
*   **Output:** A single number, 2 (red).
* The output represents a count.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)]
      - color: white (0)
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]

  - type: integer
    value: 2

relationships:
  - type: count
    description: The output integer represents a count of something in the input grid.

actions:
    - type: find object
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Objects**: Locate separate, contiguous blocks of the same color within the grid. Each block counts as an object.
2.  **Count**: Count the number of azure (8) colored objects.
3.  **Output**: output is 2.

Based on the above observations. the input grid has azure objects that can split into 2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
