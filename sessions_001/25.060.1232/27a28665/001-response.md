Okay, I've reviewed the provided input-output pairs. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids in the input, and a single-color square with a digit in the output. The grids contain single-digit numbers (0-9), representing different colors. The output seems to be a single digit that relates to the colored numbers in the input grid, with the color of the output square representing the color corresponding to the number in the input. It seems like we are counting something in input and using it to make the output. The output number seems to be a *count* somehow.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid: 3x3 grid
  - output_square: 1x1 grid
  - cells: individual elements within the grids, with integer values (0-9)
  - color_map: defines the color of a cell based on its value
properties:
  - cell_value: integer (0-9)
  - cell_color: derived from cell_value using COLOR_MAP
  - count: the output number (integer)
actions:
  - count_non_zero: count cells with a value not equal to zero.
  - count_specific_color: count the number of occurrences of a specific value in the input grid
relationships:
  - input_to_output: the input grid determines output digit and color
  - output value represents a count of the non-zero and non-white colored pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid:** Observe the 3x3 grid and note the integer value of each cell.
2.  **Identify the non-zero values:** Count the number of cells with values that are not equal to zero (white color).
3. **Produce the output** single digit representing the counted value from step 2. The output color seems to depend on example:
    *   If non-zero count is 1, the output is blue.
    *   If non-zero count is 2, output is red.
    *   If non-zero count is 3, output is green.
    *   If non-zero count is 4 or 5, no pattern - skip.
    *   If non-zero count is 6, the output is magenta

Essentially input to output performs this: Count the non-zero (non-white) values.
