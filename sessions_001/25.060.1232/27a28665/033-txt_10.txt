    [[5, 5, 5],
     [5, 5, 5],
     [5, 5, 5]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** `[[5]]`
*   **Code Output:** `[[5]]`
*   **Assessment:** Correct. All pixels are the same color (gray) as the center, and the output is a 1x1 gray grid.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 5, 5, 5, 0],
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
     [0, 5, 5, 5, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** `[[5]]`
*   **Code Output:** `[[1]]`
*   **Assessment:** Incorrect. Not all pixels are the same color as the center (gray). The code incorrectly outputs blue. The expected output is gray. This indicates a more complex relationship is involved than just uniformity. We observe there is a solid gray object/shape and the border is made of a different color.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0],
     [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],
     [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
     [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** `[[5]]`
*   **Code Output:** `[[1]]`
*   **Assessment:** Incorrect. Similar to Example 2, not all pixels match the center, but the output should be gray. There is a solid gray object with borders made of different colors.

**Example 4:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
     [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0],
     [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
     [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],
     [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0],
     [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*    **Expected Output:** `[[7]]`
*    **Code Output:** `[[1]]`
*   **Assessment:** Incorrect, output should be orange. There is a solid shape of orange pixels with a border of black pixels.

**Example 5:**
*    **Input:**
    ```
    [[6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6],
     [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0],
     [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6],
     [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0],
     [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6],
     [0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0],
     [6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 6]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output**: `[[6]]`
*   **Code Output**: `[[1]]`
*   **Assessment**: Incorrect, output should be magenta. The shape is less like the others, but is still a consistent color "inside" and a different color "outside".
