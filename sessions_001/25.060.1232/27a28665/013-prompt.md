Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves counting the number of rows that contain at least one azure (8) pixel. The output is a 1x1 grid where the single cell's value is the number of such rows.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Counts the number of rows containing at least one azure (8) pixel.
    Returns the count as a 1x1 grid.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier processing.
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)

    # Initialize a count of rows with azure pixels.
    row_count = 0

    # Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    for row in input_grid:
        # Check if the color 8 (azure) is present in the current row.
        if 8 in row:
            # Increment the count if azure is found.
            row_count += 1

    # Create a 1x1 output grid with the final count.
    output_grid = np.array([[row_count]])

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
