Here's my analysis:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 3x3 grids in the input, and a single-color square with a digit in the output. The grids contain single-digit numbers (0-9), representing different colors. The output seems to be a single digit that relates to the colored numbers in the input grid, with the color of the output square representing the color corresponding to the number in the input. It seems like we are counting something in input and using it to make the output. The output number seems to be a *count* somehow.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The output color seems to depend on example:\n    *   If non-zero count is 1, the output is blue.\n    *   If non-zero count is 2, output is red.\n    *   If non-zero count is 3, output is green.\n    *   If non-zero count is 4 or 5, no pattern - skip.\n    *   If non-zero count is 6, the output is magenta\n\nEssentially input to output performs this: Count the non-zero (non-white) values.\n"
