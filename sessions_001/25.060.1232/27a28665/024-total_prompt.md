**input:**
```
0 8 8
0 8 8
8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B94CA50>

**output:**
```
3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B94CE50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: white (0) and azure (8). The output is a single number, 3, represented as a green (3) 1x1 grid. The number 3 seems to correspond to the number of azure colored pixels in the diagonal.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: azure
        value: 8
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements:
       - color: green
         value: 3

actions:
  - name: count_diagonal_azure
    input: input_grid
    description: Counts the number of azure (8) pixels along the main diagonal of the input grid.

relationships:
  - subject: output_grid
    predicate: represents
    object: count of azure pixels on diagonal
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid:** Observe the 3x3 grid.
2.  **Identify the main diagonal:** This runs from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.
3.  **Count azure pixels:** Count the number of azure (8) pixels along this diagonal.
4.  **Output the count:** Create a 1 x1 output grid, the cell value set to the count value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
