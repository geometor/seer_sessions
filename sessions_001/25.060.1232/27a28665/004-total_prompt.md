**input:**
```
5 5 0
5 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE41B94F8D0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE41B94CC50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing the digits '0' and '5'.  '0' corresponds to white and '5' corresponds to gray. The output is a 1x1 grid containing the digit '1', which corresponds to blue.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements: [1]

properties:
  - object: grid (3x3)
    attribute: color_distribution
    value: {0: 3, 5: 6}
  - object: grid (1x1)
    attribute: color
    value: 1

actions:
  - name: count_colors
    input: grid (3x3)
    output: color_distribution

relationships:
 - subject: input grid
   relation: transformed_to
   object: output grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count Occurrences:** Count the number of times each color (represented by digits) appears in the input grid.
2.  **Check for Majority:** If there's a color that appears more than all other colors, it is the majority color and the count of this majority color is greater or equal to the sum of the count of all other colors, create a new 1x1 matrix and populate the 1 x 1 grid with the value "1". If these conditions are not true, there is no transformation.

Essentially, it appears we transform the input grid with one value equal to `1` if there exists one majority color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
