The colors in the input are white (0) and red (2).  The output uses gray (5) and white (0). It seems like the output grid is a condensed or summarized version of the input grid. The red pixels in the input appear to correspond to gray pixels in the output, in locations that form connected objects. The structure is that the gray pixels in the output are arranged into a 3x1 shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
