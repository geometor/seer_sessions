Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Count: Count the number of green (value 3) pixels in the input grid.
2. Compress: Reduce the grid size from 5x5 to 3x3.
3. Fill output: If the green count is greater than 0, fill the bottom right
   corner cells with the value 5, in a square, the amount of pixels equals the
   count of the green. Fill all other cells with zero.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Count the number of green pixels (value 3).
    green_count = np.sum(input_grid == 3)

    # Initialize a 3x3 output grid filled with 0.
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)
    
    # Fill output - create a solid square of the value '5' based on green count
    if green_count > 0:
        side = int(np.sqrt(green_count))
        if side <= 3:          
            output_grid[-side:, -side:] = 5
        else:
            output_grid[:,:] = 5


    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program and supporting YAML observations.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and code were a reasonable starting point, focusing on counting green pixels and conditionally filling a region of the output grid. However, the results across multiple training examples reveal that the logic is too simplistic and needs refinement. The core issue is that the size and shape of the output are NOT always 3x3, and the filling of the value '5' (gray) is related to the green count, but not always in a square. It depends on the total size of the output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Inspect All Examples:** We need to carefully examine *all* input/output pairs, not just the first one. We must move past the initial assumption of a 3x3 output.
2.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** For each input/output pair, we'll use Python code (within the `code_execution` tool) to determine:
    *   Dimensions of input and output grids.
    *   Number of green pixels in the input.
    *   Number of gray pixels in the output.
    *   Precise location of gray pixels in the output.
3.  **Identify the True Relationship:** The key is to find the precise rule connecting green pixel count, output grid size, and gray pixel placement. It's likely that gray pixels are only used in the output.
4. **Refine Natural Language Program**
5.  **Update YAML:** Capture the refined observations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
