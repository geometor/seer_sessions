task_id: 39e1d7f9
observations:
  - input_grid_size: 5x5
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - object_colors:
      input: [green, black]
      output: [gray, black]
  - object_transformations:
      - color_change: green -> gray
      - shape_preservation:
          - "single green pixel transforms to a single gray pixel"
          - "vertical green line transforms to a vertical gray line"
          - "two separate green pixels transform into two separate gray pixels"
  - spatial_relationships: "The relative positions (vertical/horizontal) of green objects are preserved after transformation to gray."
  - background: "all non-green pixels in the input remain black (0) in the output"
