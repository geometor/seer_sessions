facts:
  - observation: "The number of gray pixels in the output grid always equals the number of green pixels in the input grid."
    type: count
    related_objects: [gray pixel, green pixel]
  - observation: "The output grid's height is related to the green pixel count, potentially green_count + 1, but this is not consistent."
    type: dimension
    related_objects: [output grid, green pixel]
    details: "Need to verify exact relationship."
  - observation: "The output grid's width is the input grid's height minus 2."
    type: dimension
    related_objects: [output grid, input grid]
  - observation: "The arrangement of gray pixels is not a simple bottom-right fill. It appears to be influenced by the position/arrangement, but not consistently."
    type: spatial_relationship
    related_objects: [gray pixel, output grid]
    details: "Investigate the precise positioning logic. It might involve row/column indices or relative positions."
  - observation: "In examples 2 and 3, where the green count results in gray_count + 1 > input_height - 2, output has only 1 row."
    type: constraint
    details: "Output row count can not be more than input height - 2."
