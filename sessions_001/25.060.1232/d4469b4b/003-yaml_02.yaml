  - transformation:
      type: "grid size reduction and color replacement"
      input_color_mapping:
        0: "no change"
        2: "becomes 5"
      spatial_relationship: |
           The transformation appears to involve combining or summarizing regions
           of the input grid to produce the output grid and specifically, all 2s become 5s.
