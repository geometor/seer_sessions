Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Blue Region:** Find the contiguous block of blue pixels (color 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Calculate the bounding box of this blue region. Let `bb_h` be the height and `bb_w` be the width of the bounding box.
3.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**  There are three variations:
    *   If bb_h == 3 and bb_w == 3, then output is bb_h by bb_w
    *   If bb_h == 3 and bb_w == 4, then output is bb_h + 1 by bb_w
    *   If bb_h == 3 and bb_w == 5, then output is bb_h + 2 by bb_w + 1
    *   If bb_h == 3 and bb_w == 4, then output can also be bb_h + 1 by bb_w + 2, if this occurs, then the pixels for the top 2 rows x first 2 columns and top 2 rows x last 2 columns are white and the remaining pixels are gray.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with the dimensions determined in step 3.
5. **Fill the Output:**
    *   If output dimensions = input blue region bounding box dimensions or output dimensions are (bb_h + 2, bb_w+1): fill the output grid with gray pixels (color 5). Place white pixels (color 0) at the four corners of the output grid: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
    *   If output dimensions = (bb_h+1, bb_w): fill with gray, and put white at corners.
    *    If output dimension = (bb_h + 1, bb_w + 2), then the pixels for the top 2 rows x first 2 columns and top 2 rows x last 2 columns are white and the remaining pixels are gray.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
