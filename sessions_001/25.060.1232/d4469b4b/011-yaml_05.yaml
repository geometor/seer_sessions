examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: rectangle
          bounding_box: [3, 3] # Height, Width
      output_objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: rectangle
          size: [3, 3]
        - color: white
          shape: points
          positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [2,0], [2,2]] # Corners
      transformation: |
          The output is a rectangle of gray pixels with the same dimensions as the
          blue rectangle's bounding box in the input. White pixels are placed at the
          four corners of the output rectangle.

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: rectangle
          bounding_box: [3, 4]
      output_objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: rectangle
          size: [4, 4]
        - color: white
          shape: points
          positions: [[0,0], [0,3], [3,0], [3,3]]
      transformation: |
         The output is a rectangle of size (bb_h + 1, bb_w) of gray pixes. White pixels are at each corner.

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: rectangle
          bounding_box: [3, 4]
      output_objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: rectangle
          size: [4, 6]
        - color: white
          shape: points
          positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [0,4], [0,5], [1,4], [1,5]]
      transformation: |
          The output is size (blue.h+1, blue.w + 2), the top two rows are filled, with the first two and last two pixels being white and others gray.

  - example_4:
      input_objects:
        - color: blue
          shape: rectangle
          bounding_box: [3, 5]
      output_objects:
        - color: gray
          shape: rectangle
          size: [5, 6]
        - color: white
          shape: points
          positions: [[0,0], [0,5], [4,0], [4,5]]
      transformation: |
         Output size is (bb_h + 2, bb_w + 1), and fill with gray, put white on corners.
