**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7CE423327BD0>

**output:**
```
0 5 0
5 5 5

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (5x5) into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and 1 (blue), while the output grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and 5 (gray). It appears the transformation involves some form of compression or summarization of the input grid. There's a change of not just size, but also color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 5x5
  - output_grid_size: 3x3
  - input_colors: [0, 1]  # white, blue
  - output_colors: [0, 5] # white, gray
  - transformation_type: compression/summarization
  - color_change: blue (1) becomes gray (5)
  - object_interaction: the set of blue pixels in input is replaced by the set of grey pixels in the output
  - object_relationship:
      input: an "L" shape object created by contiguous blue pixels
      output: grey pixels filling all cells except the corners
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Region:** Locate all blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
2. **Create Bounding Box.** The bounding box of the shape in input will be the size of the output
3.  **Compress to Output Grid:** Create 3x3 output.
4.  **Fill with Gray:** Fill cells inside the box with the color gray (5) except the corners.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
