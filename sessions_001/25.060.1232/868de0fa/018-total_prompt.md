Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the code on the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying white regions enclosed by blue pixels and filling them alternately with red and orange. The subsequent examples reveal a flaw in this approach: the assumption that the enclosed regions are independent of the surrounding pixels.

The primary issue is that the initial program doesn't fully capture the "enclosed" concept. It finds *all* contiguous white regions, but it doesn't correctly consider the context of the input and whether white regions are open.

The strategy for resolving this is to improve the region-finding logic (`find_regions`) to correctly identify white regions that are *completely* surrounded by blue pixels.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand the specific failures, let's examine each example:
*NOTE: I'm including a way to determine the number of regions, and
whether any open white pixels are present.*

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:** Scan the input grid to find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels that are *completely* enclosed by blue (1) pixels. A region is considered enclosed only if *all* of its constituent white pixels have neighboring blue pixels in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

2. **Identify Open Regions** Scan the input grid to find all contiguous regions of white (0) pixels that have at least one pixel in the group that does not have all blue pixels for neighbors in all for cardinal directions.

3.  **Fill Inner Regions:** Fill the enclosed white regions with orange (7).

4.  Leave the surrounding blue (1) pixels unchanged. Do not change the open white regions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
