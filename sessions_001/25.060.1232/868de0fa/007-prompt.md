Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialization:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.

2.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous blue regions (objects) in the input grid. Consider diagonally connected pixels as belonging to *separate* objects.

3.  **Border Identification:** Identify all blue pixels that are on the border of the grid.

4. **Interior Pixel Identification** For each object, determine its *interior pixels*. These are blue pixels where all four directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right) are also blue.

5.  **Color Transformation:**
    *   Blue border pixels remain blue.
    *  Change the color of large blue objects' *interior* pixels as follows:
      * if any of the object's pixels are in the top-left quadrant of the grid, and not all are border pixels, change the *interior* pixels to red (2)
      * Otherwise, if the object is large (more than 4 pixels) and not all border pixels, change interior pixels to orange (7).
    *   White pixels remain white.

6.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
