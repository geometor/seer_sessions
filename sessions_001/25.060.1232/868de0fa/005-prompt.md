Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialization:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.

2.  **Color Preservation:** All white (0) pixels in the input grid remain white (0) in the output grid.

3.  **Object Identification:** Identify contiguous regions (objects) of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Consider diagonally touching pixels as part of distinct regions.

4.  **Color Transformation by Object:**
    *   Blue pixels at top and bottom borders stay blue.
    *   Blue pixels at left and right borders stay blue.
    *   The blue object in the top-left corner that forms a shape similar to a square has the interior blue (1) changed to red (2).
    *   The blue object in the middle-right that forms a cross or plus shape has the interior blue (1) pixels changed to orange (7).
    *   The blue object at the center-bottom, similar to a reversed L, with interior blue (1) pixels, are changed to orange (7)

5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the final output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
