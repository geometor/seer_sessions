The primary colors observed are blue (1), white (0), red (2), and orange (7). The transformation seems to involve identifying blue (1) colored shapes and then either filling them with a new color or leaving the blue. The replacement color inside the shape is based on the type of the shape. If the input blue shape does not fully enclose a region, it is replaced with orange (7). If the input blue shape forms a closed boundary/region, the inside pixels are colored red (2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There may be complex, nested closed shapes, each should be identified as separate objects and actions.\n\n3. **Fill Enclosed Regions:** If a blue shape is closed, change the color of all pixels *inside* the enclosed region to red (2).\n\n4. **Fill open blue shapes:** If a blue shape is open, change the color of all pixels of the open blue shape to orange (7).\n\n5. **Output:** The output grid reflects these color changes, with other pixels retaining their original colors.\n"
