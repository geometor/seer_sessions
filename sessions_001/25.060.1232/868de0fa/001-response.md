Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing numerical values representing different colors. The primary colors observed are blue (1), white (0), red (2), and orange (7). The transformation seems to involve identifying blue (1) colored shapes and then either filling them with a new color or leaving the blue. The replacement color inside the shape is based on the type of the shape. If the input blue shape does not fully enclose a region, it is replaced with orange (7). If the input blue shape forms a closed boundary/region, the inside pixels are colored red (2).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: blue_shape
    type: connected component
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape:  can be open or closed
      - bounding_box: rectangle enclosing the shape

  - name: enclosed_region
    type: area within a closed blue_shape
    properties:
      - color: varies (potentially white (0) initially)

actions:
  - name: identify_shapes
    description: Find connected components of blue (1) pixels.

  - name: determine_closure
    description: Check if a blue shape forms a closed boundary.

  - name: fill_region
    description: Change the color of pixels inside a closed blue shape to red (2).
  
  - name: fill_open
    description: Change the color of pixels of an open blue shape to orange (7)

relationships:
  - blue_shapes *contain* enclosed_regions (if closed).
  - grid *is_composed_of* cells.
  - cells *can_be_part_of* blue_shapes or enclosed_regions.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Blue Shapes:** Scan the input grid and identify all connected components of blue (1) pixels. These are the "blue shapes."

2. **Check for Closure:** For each identified blue shape, determine if it forms a closed boundary. A closed boundary completely encloses an internal region. There may be complex, nested closed shapes, each should be identified as separate objects and actions.

3. **Fill Enclosed Regions:** If a blue shape is closed, change the color of all pixels *inside* the enclosed region to red (2).

4. **Fill open blue shapes:** If a blue shape is open, change the color of all pixels of the open blue shape to orange (7).

5. **Output:** The output grid reflects these color changes, with other pixels retaining their original colors.
