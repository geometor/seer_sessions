The input grid contains two distinct shapes formed by blue (1) pixels against a white (0) background. These blue shapes seem to be \"filled in\" with different colors in the output grid. The upper blue shape is filled with orange (7), and the lower blue shape is filled with red (2). The outlines remain blue.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
