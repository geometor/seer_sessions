Previous Code:
```python
"""
Observe the input grid. Identify the presence of a contiguous block of red pixels. This block may or may not contain a single yellow pixel. This red region is surrounded by white pixels.
Regardless of the input grid's contents, create a 1x1 output grid.
Fill this output grid with blue (color index 1).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a 1x1 numpy array.
    output_grid = np.array([[1]])

    # The output is always a 1x1 grid with the color blue (1), regardless of the input.
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
