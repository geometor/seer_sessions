The input image shows a distinct pattern.\n*   **Output:** A 1x1 grid containing a single blue (1) pixel. The output seems to be a significant reduction and simplification of the input.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to be reducing the entire input grid into a single pixel, perhaps based on some property of the input grid. The output color (blue) is not present in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
