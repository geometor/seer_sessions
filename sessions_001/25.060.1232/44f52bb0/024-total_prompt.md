Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Count the number of red (color 2) pixels in the input grid.
2. Add one to the count obtained in step 1.
3. Create a square output grid. If the number in Step 2 result, *N*, is greater than 1, the output grid is *N-1* x *N-1*. Otherwise, the output grid size is 1x1.
4. Set all the pixel values in the output grid equal to the number obtained in step 2.

def transform(input_grid):
    # Count the number of red (color 2) pixels in the input grid.
    red_pixel_count = np.sum(input_grid == 2)

    # Add one to the count.
    output_value = red_pixel_count + 1
    
    # Determine output grid size
    if output_value > 1:
        size = output_value - 1
    else:

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved counting red pixels, adding one, and creating a square grid. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize. The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example. The size and color of the generated grid are not always connected to the initial red count. We need a more general rule.

My strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze each example**: Carefully examine the input and output grids, focusing on the relationship between them, not just the red pixels. I will run a code block to gather grid dimensions, pixel counts for each color, and relationships of size, color, and pixel counts.
2.  **Identify common patterns**: Look for consistent relationships that hold across *all* training examples.
3.  **Revise the natural language program**:  Develop a new program that captures the generalized transformation rule, and is not overly specific.
4.  Verify: Mentally check, that the proposed general rule will be applicable to all the input/output pairs provided.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Output Dimensions**: The output grid's dimensions depend on the input's.
    *   In Example 1, The output grid is square, it's side length is the shortest dimension of the input.
    *   In Examples 2 and 3, the output grid height equals to the input's height and it's width equals to the input's width + 1.
2.  **Determine Output Color:**
    * The output grid is filled with a color that's not present on the input, and is related to the dimensions of the input. The value that fills the output is obtained by the (input gridWidth + 1).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
