**input:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE423308FD0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7CE423308450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values, which seem to represent colors (0 for white, 2 for red). The output is a single numerical value (1, potentially blue). The transformation seems to involve counting or identifying specific colored pixels within the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [0, 2] # white, red
  - type: value
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [1] # blue
      - quantity: integer

actions:
  - type: count
    target: pixels
    condition: color = 2

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    description: input grid transforms to output value based on pixel count
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Examine the input grid and count the number of red pixels (pixels with a value of 2).
2.  **Output:** The output is the count determined in step 1.

Essentially it counts the number of red squares, then outputs this number, in the color of blue (value of 1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
