**input:**

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have distinct vertical columns of colors, while the output grid seems to extract and reposition a specific color, forming a new pattern. The colors themselves are crucial, and their positions relative to each other and to the grid boundaries also seem to be factors in the transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x7 (rows x columns)
      - colors: [0, 7, 1, 5]  # white, orange, blue, gray
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x3
      - colors: [0, 3] # white, green
  - object: column_1
    type: object_group
    properties:
     - color: [0,0,0,0] #white
     - location: input_grid column 0
  - object: column_7
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - location: input_grid column 6
      - color: [0,5,0,0]
  - action: color_extraction
    description: A specific color from the input is selected and used to create the output grid.
  - action: pattern_creation
    description: The selected color forms a new pattern in the output grid.
  - relationship: input_output
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a specific rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Key Color:** The transformation extracts all pixels of value '1' (blue) that are in the fourth column.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** The new grid has the same amount of rows as the input.
    It also has width of 3.

3.   **Transform the Input**: Replace the selected blue pixels in the input grid with green pixels (value `3`) in the output.
Maintain the row but set the new column based on this:
    - If the blue pixel is located at an even-numbered row index (0-indexed), place the green pixel at column index 0 of the corresponding row in the output grid.
    - If the blue pixel is located at an odd-numbered row index, place the green pixel at column index 2 of the corresponding row in the output grid.
    - all other output cells are white (0).

In other words, it looks like the transformation identifies all blue pixels in the 4th column of the input and creates an output where those selected pixels locations transform from '1' to '3'. Also, the horizontal index is determined by if the vertical index is odd or even. Odd vertical indices have an horizontal output of 2, while even vertical indices have a horizontal output of 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
