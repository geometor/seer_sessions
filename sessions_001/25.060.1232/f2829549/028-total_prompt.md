**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid. The input grid seems to have varying colors (orange, white, blue, gray), while the output grid is significantly smaller and only contains white and green pixels. The dimensions also change: the input is 4x7, and the output is 4x3. There appears to be some relationship between the blue pixels (1) in the input and green (3) in the output, while all other colors are replaced by white/blank (0).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: color_and_dimension_reduction
input_grid:
  dimensions: 4x7
  colors: [orange, white, blue, gray]
  data_type: integer
output_grid:
  dimensions: 4x3
  colors: [white, green]
  data_type: integer
objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      color: [integer, 0-9]
      position: [row, column]
actions:
  - name: transform_color
    type: conditional replacement
    condition: "if input pixel is blue (1)"
    true_action: "output pixel is green (3)"
    false_action: "output pixel is white (0)"
  - name: reduce_dimension
    type: column selection/removal
    details: "select specific columns from the input to construct the output"
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "output grid maintains relative row positioning from the input grid,
    but a subset of the column, specifically only using the column containing blue (1)"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that has the number of rows and columns equal to, the number of rows in the input, and columns of the value 1.

2.  **Color Transformation:** Iterate through specific columns of the input grid: For each column, look for the value equal to 1.

3.  **Column Selection:** Select only columns from the input grid with the value one, into a new intermediate array.

4. **Pixel Mapping**: iterate through the rows of the intermediate array.
    *   If a pixel's value in intermediate array is 1 (blue), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to 3 (green).
    *   Otherwise, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to 0 (white).

5.  **Output:** The resulting output grid is the transformed output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
