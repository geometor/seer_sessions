    description: Input grid transforms to output grid.
    rules:
        - output cell (row,col) becomes green if:
            - input contains an orange pixel:
                to the left of blue stripe and (input row == output row * 2) or (input_row == (output_row * 2) + 1)
                to the right of blue stripe at locations (r+x, c+4) where x is 0 or 1; x represents how many rows below r
                there is a orange value
