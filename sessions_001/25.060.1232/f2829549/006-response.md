Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and training examples to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial strategy was to identify a column of all 1s (blue pixels) and extract a 3-column section including that column, then change any non-black pixel to green (3). This worked for the first example, but the subsequent examples show variations that this simple rule doesn't cover. Specifically, the position of the column of 1s shifts, and sometimes the extracted section needs to include the column *before* the all-1s column, and the output size varies.

The strategy needs to be more flexible in identifying the relevant region to extract. Instead of strictly taking three columns centered on the all-1s column, it should consider variations in the position and potentially the size of the output grid. The core idea of using the column of 1s as an anchor point is still valid, but the logic for extracting the region around it needs to be improved.

**Metrics and Results Analysis**

Here are the metrics from running the code:

```text
Example 1:
{'input_shape': (7, 6), 'output_shape': (7, 3), 'predicted_shape': (7, 3), 'correct': True, 'ones_column_index': 1}
Example 2:
{'input_shape': (7, 6), 'output_shape': (7, 3), 'predicted_shape': (7, 3), 'correct': False, 'ones_column_index': 2}
Example 3:
{'input_shape': (5, 7), 'output_shape': (5, 3), 'predicted_shape': (5, 3), 'correct': False, 'ones_column_index': 4}
```

Key observations from results:

*   **Example 1:** The code works perfectly.
*   **Example 2:** The `ones_column_index` is 2. The output should include columns 1, 2, and 3. The code currently includes columns 2, 3, and 4. Prediction is incorrect.
*   **Example 3:** The `ones_column_index` is 4. The output should include columns 3, 4, and 5. The code includes columns 4, 5, and 6. Prediction is incorrect.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: "The input grid contains a column of blue pixels (1)."
    object: "blue column"
    property: "color: blue (1)"
    location_details: "column index varies"
  - description: "The output grid is a subset of the input grid."
    object: "output grid"
    property: "is a sub-grid"
  - description: "The output grid contains the blue column and its adjacent columns"
    object: "output grid"
    property: "contains blue column"
    location_details: "Adjacent columns to the blue column."
  - description: "Non-black pixels in the selected region are changed to green."
    object: "selected region"
    action: "color change"
    details: "Non-black (0) pixels become green (3)."
  - description: "The output grid's width is always 3."
    object: "output grid"
    property: width: 3
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Anchor:** Find the column in the input grid that is entirely composed of blue pixels (value 1). This is our "anchor column."

2.  **Determine Extraction Range:** The output grid will always be 3 columns wide. The included columns are the one immediately to the left of the anchor column, the anchor column, and the one immediately to its right.

3. **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid containing only the three columns identified in step 2.

4.  **Change Colors:** Within this extracted subgrid, change all pixels that are *not* black (0) to green (3).

5.  **Return:** The modified 3-column subgrid is the output.
