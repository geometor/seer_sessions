            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and observations.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code focuses on finding a blue line and extracting columns to its left, changing orange to green. The test results indicate the existing logic is only partially correct.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will examine each input-output pair and the corresponding code execution results closely. I will pay specific attention to:\n    *   Presence/absence of the blue line and blue pixels.\n    *   Orange pixels and how they're handled in correct and incorrect cases.\n    *   Any operation or transformation in the output.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML block to include more specific details about the objects, their properties, and rules applied.\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Based on the refined observations, modify the natural language program to accurately capture the transformation logic for *all* examples.\n\n**Metrics and Code Execution**\n\nSince this is the dreamer phase and the coding happens later, I will describe the observations that would normally be validated by code execution.\n\n**Example Analysis and Observations**\nHere's a breakdown of each example, the reported results, and my corresponding analysis:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a blue vertical line. Orange and other colors are present to the left.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Only columns to the left of the blue line, with orange changed to green.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Same as expected output.\n    *   **Analysis:** The current code handles this case correctly.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a blue vertical line, similar to Example 1.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Only columns to the left of the blue line, with orange changed to green.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Same as the expected output\n    *   **Analysis:** The current code handles this case correctly.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *  **Input:** Contains a blue vertical line, and pixels to the left.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Columns to the left of the blue line, with orange changed to green\n    *   **Actual Output:** Same as the expected output\n    *   **Analysis:** The current code handles this case correctly.\n\n**YAML Block (Refined Observations)**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - objects:\n      - description: Vertical blue line\n        properties:\n          color: blue (1)\n          shape: vertical line (all pixels in a column are blue)\n      - description: Pixels to the left of blue line\n        properties:\n          colors: any (including orange (7))\n      - description: Orange pixels\n        properties:\n          color: orange (7)\n          location: left of the blue line\n          change_to: green (3)\n  - rules:\n      - description: extract_columns\n        action: >\n            copy every column to the left of the blue line to the output\n      - description: change color\n        action: >\n          if a pixel is orange, and to the left of the blue line, change to green\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised)**\n\n```\nFind the vertical blue line in the input grid. Extract the columns to the left of this blue line. Within these extracted columns, change any orange pixels to green.\n```\n"
