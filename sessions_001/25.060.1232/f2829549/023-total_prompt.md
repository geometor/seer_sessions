Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extract the columns to the left of the blue line, changing any orange pixels in those columns to green, and make every other cell white.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_blue_line_column(grid):
    # Iterate through columns to find the one containing only blue (1) pixels.
    for j in range(grid.shape[1]):
        if np.all(grid[:, j] == 1):
            return j
    return -1  # Return -1 if no blue line is found

def transform(input_grid):
    # Find the column index of the blue line.
    blue_line_column = find_blue_line_column(input_grid)

    # Initialize the output grid with the correct dimensions (same height, width up to blue line).
    output_grid = np.zeros((input_grid.shape[0], blue_line_column), dtype=int)
    
    # copy the grid up to blue line
    output_grid = input_grid[:, :blue_line_column].copy()

    # change any orange (7) to green(3)
    output_grid[output_grid == 7] = 3
    
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
