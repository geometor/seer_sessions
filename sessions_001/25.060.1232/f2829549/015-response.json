The input grid appears to have distinct vertical columns of colors, while the output grid seems to extract and reposition a specific color, forming a new pattern. The colors themselves are crucial, and their positions relative to each other and to the grid boundaries also seem to be factors in the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Also, the horizontal index is determined by if the vertical index is odd or even. Odd vertical indices have an horizontal output of 2, while even vertical indices have a horizontal output of 0.\n"
