  input:
    shape: [4, 5]
    blue_pixels:
      count: 3
      locations: [[0, 2], [1, 4], [3, 1]]
  output:
    shape: [4, 3]
    green_pixels:
      count: 3
      locations: [[0, 0], [1, 2], [3, 0]]
  observations:
    - "Output grid has three columns."
    - "Number of green pixels matches the number of blue pixels."
    - "Green and blue pixels share row indices."
    - "Green pixel column is determined by the parity of the corresponding blue pixel's row: even row -> column 0, odd row -> column 2."
