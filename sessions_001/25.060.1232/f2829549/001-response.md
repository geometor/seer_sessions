Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grids:** The input grids are rectangular and contain various colors represented by digits 0-9. There's a consistent vertical blue (1) stripe and varying arrangements of orange (7) and grey (5) pixels. The rest of the grid appears to be white (0).
*   **Output Grids:** The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids (3x3). They seem to contain only green (3) and white (0) pixels. The green pixels appear to be strategically placed, while the remaining cells are white.
* **Relationship:**: The green pixels' placement in the output grid seems related to the position of non-white, non-blue and specifically orange pixels in the input grid, relative to the central blue (1) column.

**YAML Fact Identification:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 5, 7] # White, Blue, Grey, Orange
      - size: variable (rows x cols)
      - blue_stripe:
          presence: true
          color: 1 # Blue
          location: vertical, column index 3

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 3] # White, Green
      - size: 3x3

  - relation: transformation
    description: Input grid transforms to output grid.
    rules:
        - output cell (row,col) becomes green if:
            - input contains an orange pixel:
                to the left of blue stripe and (input row == output row * 2) or (input_row == (output_row * 2) + 1)
                to the right of blue stripe at locations (r+x, c+4) where x is 0 or 1; x represents how many rows below r
                there is a orange value

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Blue Stripe:** Locate the vertical blue (1) stripe in the input grid. This stripe serves as a reference point. It is always in column index 3.
2.  **Output Grid Dimensions:** The output grid is always 3x3.
3.  **Mapping Input to Output:** For each cell in the output grid (at row *r* and column *c*):
    *   Examine rows r\*2 and (r\*2)+1 in the Input grid.
    *   If there's an orange (7) pixel to the *left* of the blue stripe in either of those rows:
        *   Set the output grid cell (*r*, *c*) to green (3).
        * Where c = 0 or 1 (corresponding to the orange on left of the input grid's blue line being in the first or second column.
    * if there is an orange (7) pixel to the *right* of the blue stripe and 4 colums to the right of blue, in rows (r\*2) or (r\*2+1):
       *  Set the output grid cell (*r*, *c*) to green (3).
        * where c=2
    *   Otherwise, set the output grid cell (*r*, *c*) to white (0).

In summary, the output grid is a 3x3 representation indicating the presence of orange pixels in specific regions relative to the blue stripe in the input grid. Two rows of input map to a single row of output. The left two columns and the right most section beside the blue stripe define the green zones.
