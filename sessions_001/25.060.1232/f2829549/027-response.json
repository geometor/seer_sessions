The input grid seems to have varying colors (orange, white, blue, gray), while the output grid is significantly smaller and only contains white and green pixels. The dimensions also change: the input is 4x7, and the output is 4x3. There appears to be some relationship between the blue pixels (1) in the input and green (3) in the output, while all other colors are replaced by white/blank (0).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
