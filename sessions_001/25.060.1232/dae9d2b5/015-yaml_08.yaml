facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 6]
      colors: [0, 3, 4]
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      colors: [0, 6]
  - color_mapping:
      0: white
      3: green
      4: yellow
      6: magenta
  - input_objects:
    - object1:
      color: 4
      shape: contiguous block #need to confirm shape
      location: [0,2], [1,1], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1]
    - object2:
      color: 3
      shape: contiguous block # need to confirm shape
      location: [0,4], [1, 3], [1, 5], [2,5]
  - output_objects:
    - object:
      color: 6
      location: fills almost entire grid except for [0,0]
  - transformations:
      - color_change:  "All non-zero pixels in the input are replaced with magenta (6) in the output."
      - dimension_change: "Output grid dimensions are different than the input."
      - spatial_relationship: The top-left zero remains zero.
