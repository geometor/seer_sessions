facts:
  - input_grid_dimensions: 3x6
  - output_grid_dimensions: 3x3
  - input_colors: [0, 3, 4]
  - output_colors: [0, 6]
  - input_objects:
      - color: 3
        positions: [(0,4), (2,3), (2,4)]
      - color: 4
        positions:  [(1,0), (2,2)]
  - output_objects:
      - color: 6
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]
  - color_mapping:
      - input: 3
        output: 6
      - input: 4
        output: 6
  - spatial_relationship: Input grid is condensed into the output grid, with non-zero input pixels mapping to a specific location and color in output grid.
