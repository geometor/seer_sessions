**input:**
```
4 4 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7CE41B97A350>

**output:**
```
6 6 0
0 0 6
6 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7CE4232F2050>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input grid has dimensions 3x6 (rows x columns), and the output grid has dimensions 3x3.  The colors in the input include yellow (4), green (3), and white (0). The output grid includes magenta (6) and white (0). The number of non-white pixels seems to be conserved, and there appears to be some relationship between input and output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - task: "grid transformation"
  - input_grid_dimensions: [3, 6]
  - output_grid_dimensions: [3, 3]
  - input_colors:
    - yellow: 4
    - green: 3
    - white: 0
  - output_colors:
    - magenta: 6
    - white: 0
  - object_count:
      input:
        yellow: 2
        green: 2
        white: 14
      output:
          magenta: 4
          white: 5
  - observations:
    - "The output grid is smaller in the x-dimension (columns)"
    - "The output grid has a total of 4 cells of 6 (magenta)."
    - "The number of colored pixels (non-white) is conserved."
    - "The input grid has 2 yellow and 2 green blocks, summing to 4 non-zero numbers."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count Colored Pixels:** Count the number of non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with dimensions 3x3.
3.  **Fill with Color:**  Fill the number of counted colored pixels, starting from top-left and filling from left to right and top to down.
4.  **Fill Remainder:** Fill the remaining cells in the output grid with white (0).

Essentially, the transformation counts the colored pixels and fills an equal number of cells in the output grid with a different color. The positions of the colored pixels don't seem to matter in this transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
