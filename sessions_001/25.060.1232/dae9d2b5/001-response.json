Here's a breakdown of my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** Rectangular grids of varying dimensions, containing digits 0-9, representing colors.\n*   **Output Grids:** Rectangular grids, consistently 3x3, containing digits 0 and 6 (white and magenta).\n*   **Colors:** The input grids contain yellow (4), green (3), and white (0). The output grids contain only magenta (6) and white (0).\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve replacing specific colors (yellow and green) with magenta (6) and maintaining white (0) while resizing the grid to 3x3. The positioning of the magenta and white pixels seems to relate to locations of non-white colors in input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Keep all white pixels (0) as white (0).\n\n3.  **Grid Resizing:**  Resize the grid to a 3x3 grid.\n\n4. **Positional mapping**:\n    *   Iterate through the original grid's rows and columns.\n    *    If a non-white pixel is present in the any position in an input row, the corresponding row index in output is magenta. If only white is in the input row, it's position is white in output.\n    *    Combine the new color with the new dimensions to generate output.\n\nIn summary: every row which includes any non-white pixel will result the corresponding row in output being magenta. The output is always a 3x3.\n"
