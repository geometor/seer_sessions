observations:
  - task: "Condense input grid to 3x3 output, preserving relative object structure."
  - input_objects: "Non-white pixels in the input grid, possibly forming connected shapes (objects)."
  - input_object_properties:
      - color: "Varies (1-9)."
      - position: "Row and column indices within the input grid."
      - connectivity: "Pixels of the same color adjacent to each other form an object."
  - output_objects: "Magenta (6) pixels in a 3x3 grid."
  - output_object_properties:
      - color: "Magenta (6)."
      - position: "Reflects the relative position/arrangement of input objects, scaled down to 3x3."
  - actions:
      - "Identify non-white pixels/objects in the input grid."
      - "Map the spatial configuration of the input objects to a 3x3 output grid."
      - "Represent input objects with magenta pixels in the output grid, maintaining relative positions."
