The input grid has dimensions 3x6 (rows x columns), and the output grid has dimensions 3x3.  The colors in the input include yellow (4), green (3), and white (0). The output grid includes magenta (6) and white (0). The number of non-white pixels seems to be conserved, and there appears to be some relationship between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
