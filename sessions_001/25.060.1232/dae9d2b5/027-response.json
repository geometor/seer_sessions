The colors present are white (0), green (3), and yellow (4).\n*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid with colored pixels. The colors present are white (0) and magenta (6).\n*   **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be a compressed and recolored version of the input grid. The dimensions are reduced, and the non-white colors in the input are replaced with magenta in the output. There appears to be a relationship between the input positions and output positions, as the colors that are not white have a specific arrangement in the output grid based on where the input is a non-white cell.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If a cell is not white(0)\n    * replace its value with magenta (6).\n4.  **Condensation and Placement:** : Create output grid\n    - If a cell in the input grid had green(3) or yellow(4)\n    - Set the cell to magenta(6) based on relative locations.\n    - The first non-white cell from top left will get mapped to output\\_grid\\[0]\\[1].\n    - The next non-white cells will be filled, to output\\_grid\\[1]\\[0], output\\_grid\\[2]\\[0], output\\_grid\\[2]\\[1] and output\\[2]\\[2].\n\nIn short: every non-white pixel from input grid, is set to 6 (magenta) in the output grid.
