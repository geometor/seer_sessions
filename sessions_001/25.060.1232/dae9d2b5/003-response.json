The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x6 in this example). The colors are defined by a color map that's provided. The transformation doesn't seem to involve complex spatial reasoning or object manipulation at first glance, rather a simple replacement based on some rule related to the pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
