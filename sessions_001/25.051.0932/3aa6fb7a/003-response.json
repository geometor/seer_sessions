            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the second example.\n\n**YAML Observation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  input_grid:\n    - object_1:\n        color: 8 (azure)\n        shape: L-shape\n        position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)\n    - object_2:\n        color: 8 (azure)\n        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)\n        position: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n    - object_3:\n        color: 8 (azure)\n        shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)\n        position: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\n  output_grid:\n    - object_1:\n        color: 8 (azure)\n        shape: L-shape\n        position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)\n    - object_2:\n        color: 8 (azure)\n        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)\n        position: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n    - object_3:\n        color: 8 (azure)\n        shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)\n        position: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n    - object_4:\n        color: 1 (blue)\n        shape: single cell\n        position: (1,4)\n    - object_5:\n        color: 1 (blue)\n        shape: single cell\n        position: (2,3)\n    - object_6:\n        color: 1 (blue)\n        shape: single cell\n        position: (5,3)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Description:**\n\nThe input grid has three L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8). The output grid contains the same three L-shaped objects, in the same positions and orientations.  Additionally, the output grid has a single blue (1) cell placed at the vertex (corner) of each of the azure L-shapes.\n\n**Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):**\n\n1.  **Identify** all L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.\n2.  **Copy** these L-shaped objects to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and shapes.\n3.  **Find** the vertex (corner cell) of each L-shaped object.\n4.  **Place** a blue (color 1) cell at the vertex location of each L-shaped object in the output grid.\n\nThe Python code provided in the previous response correctly implements this rule. No changes are necessary to the `transform` or `find_l_shapes` function. This example confirms the correctness of the previous solution, including handling of multiple L-shapes and different orientations.\n"
