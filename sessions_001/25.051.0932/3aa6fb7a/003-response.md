Okay, let's analyze the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
        position: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)
    - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)
        position: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)

  output_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (0,4), (0,5), (1,5)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
        position: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)
    - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)
        position: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)
    - object_4:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1,4)
    - object_5:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (2,3)
    - object_6:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (5,3)
```

**Natural Language Description:**

The input grid has three L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8). The output grid contains the same three L-shaped objects, in the same positions and orientations.  Additionally, the output grid has a single blue (1) cell placed at the vertex (corner) of each of the azure L-shapes.

**Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):**

1.  **Identify** all L-shaped objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Copy** these L-shaped objects to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and shapes.
3.  **Find** the vertex (corner cell) of each L-shaped object.
4.  **Place** a blue (color 1) cell at the vertex location of each L-shaped object in the output grid.

The Python code provided in the previous response correctly implements this rule. No changes are necessary to the `transform` or `find_l_shapes` function. This example confirms the correctness of the previous solution, including handling of multiple L-shapes and different orientations.
