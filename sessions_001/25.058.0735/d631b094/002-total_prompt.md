## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A80FECD2CB0>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x7A80FECD25D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 3x3 grid.
*   The output is a 1x2 grid.
*   The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue).
*   The output grid contains only 1s (blue).
*   The number of 1s in the input grid seems to correspond to the number of cells in the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Input grid dimensions
      elements: [0, 1] # Possible cell values
      name: input_grid
  - type: grid
    properties:
       dimensions: [1, 2] # Output grid dimensions
       elements: [1]
       name: output_grid
  - type: cell
    properties:
       value: integer # 0 or 1
       color: [white, blue] # Based on value
       position: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: count_occurrences
    input: input_grid, value
    output: integer
  - name: create_grid
    input: dimensions, fill_value
    output: grid

relationships:
    - type: correspondence
      description: The number of cells in the output grid equals the number of '1' cells in the input grid.
      from: input_grid
      to: output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of cells with the value '1' (blue cells) in the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid. The dimensions will be 1 x N, where N is the count obtained in step 1.
3.  **Fill:** Fill all the cells of the new grid with the value '1' (make them blue).

Essentially, the program extracts all blue pixels, counts them, and creates a new grid to show how many were found, all of the same blue color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
