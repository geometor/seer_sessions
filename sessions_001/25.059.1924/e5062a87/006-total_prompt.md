Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Seeds:** Locate all existing red (2) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Expansion:** For each red pixel:
    *   Examine its eight neighboring pixels (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
    *   If a neighboring pixel is gray (5), change it to red (2).

3.  **Iteration**: Repeat Step 2 until it no longer changes anything. One thing I am unsure is the amount of iterations this expansion happens, but in the second iteration it includes gray that was converted to red, so at the least it is until no more changes can be made.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, conceptualizing the core idea of "red expansion" into neighboring gray pixels. However, the provided examples and generated outputs reveal a crucial limitation: the expansion is *not* unbounded. It only expands *once* from the original red pixels, not continuously until no more gray neighbors are available. The current `while changed` loop leads to over-expansion, affecting all gray pixels adjacent to any red pixel at any point in the iterative process. The logic needs to consider only the *initial* red pixels as the "seeds" for a *single* expansion step.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

The key error is the continuous expansion. We need to modify the natural language program and subsequently the code to restrict the expansion to a single step originating from the initial red pixels. This involves:

1.  **Identifying initial red pixels:** Store the locations of red pixels *before* any expansion occurs.
2.  **Single Expansion:** Perform only one iteration of neighbor checking and color conversion, using the initially identified red pixels as the source.
3. Removing while loop and changed flag.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To ensure I'm understanding the input/output pairs correctly, I need to analyze all of the pairs individually to extract metrics on size and pixels that change. It is extremely difficult to do this mentally.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    initial_red_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 2)
    gray_to_red_pixels = np.argwhere((input_grid == 5) & (output_grid == 2))
    
    print(f"Input grid size: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"Initial red pixels: {initial_red_pixels.tolist()}")
    print(f"Gray pixels changed to red: {gray_to_red_pixels.tolist()}")
    
    # Verify that all changed pixels are neighbors of initial red pixels
    for gr_row, gr_col in gray_to_red_pixels:
        is_neighbor = False
        for r_row, r_col in initial_red_pixels:
            if abs(gr_row - r_row) <= 1 and abs(gr_col - r_col) <= 1:
                is_neighbor = True
                break
        print(f"Pixel ({gr_row}, {gr_col}) is a neighbor of an initial red pixel: {is_neighbor}")
    print("---")

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
