Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The grids primarily contain the values 5 (gray), 0 (white), and 2 (red).
*   The most noticeable change is the replacement of some 0s (white pixels) with 2s (red pixels) in specific locations.
*   The red 2's in the bottom right of the input do not change, some of the white 0's are changing to red 2's.
*   It seems like only 0's near existing 2s and other 0's change. The position might be important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: pixels
      values: [0, 2, 5]
    relationships:
      - element_colors:
          0: white
          2: red
          5: gray

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, red, gray]
    actions:
      - change_color:
        from: white
        to: red
    relationships:
        - adjacency_colors: [white and red]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid, locating all white pixels (value 0).
2. **Conditional assessment** of the 0's:
   * Check if there is a contiguous block of white 0s to the left of any 0s.
   * Check if there is a red block directly right of any found 0's.
3.  **Change color:** Change the color of the targeted white pixels (0) to red (2).
4.  **Preserve other colors:** All gray (5) and pre-existing red pixels (2) remain unchanged.
5. **Copy to Output** Copy the grid with the color changes.

In summary, the program identifies specific white pixels adjacent to other white and red pixels, and changes their color to red. All other pixels remain the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
