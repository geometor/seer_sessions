The primary colors present are gray (5), white (0), and red (2). The input grid has a distinct \"L\" shape of red pixels in the top-right corner. The output grid seems to expand or \"smear\" this red shape, while also introducing more red pixels in other gray areas of the grid seemingly guided by gray areas adjacent to existing red. It appears the transformation involves some kind of interaction between the red and gray pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

One thing I am unsure is the amount of iterations this expansion happens, but in the second iteration it includes gray that was converted to red, so at the least it is until no more changes can be made.\n\nThis program describes how red pixels \"propagate\" to adjacent gray pixels. It's a form of region growing or a cellular automaton-like behavior. The key is the interaction between red and gray, with white acting as a barrier or neutral element.\n"
