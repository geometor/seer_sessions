Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors, represented by integers 0-9. The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), white (0), and red (2). The transformation appears to involve the red (2) pixels, with their positions and/or extent changing based on their initial configuration. It's not a simple mirroring, rotation, or translation. It seems like some kind of replication or propagation of the red pixels is occurring, potentially influenced by their neighboring pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - elements: pixels
      - colors: [gray, white, red]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: replication/propagation
    agent: red_pixel
    constraints: ?
    result: change_position/extent

relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels can be adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)
  - containment: grid contains pixels
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify** all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2. **For each** existing red pixel, if it doesn't form the shape below, **fill** the shape that matches.
   

```
    2
   2 2
  2   2
   2 2
    2
   ```


3. return the changed grid.

The core idea seems that red pixels make that shape where it can.
