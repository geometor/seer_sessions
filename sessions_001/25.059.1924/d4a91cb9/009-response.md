Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels.
*   The background color is white (0).
*   There are two distinct objects in the input: an azure (8) pixel and a red (2) pixel.
*   In the output, the azure (8) pixel remains unchanged.
*    The red (2) object transforms to a yellow path using color yellow (4)
*   The yellow path extends horizontally from the original red pixel's position to the column before azure.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    type: pixel
    color: azure (8)
    position: [1, 8]  # [row, column]
    properties:
      static: true
  - id: 2
    type: pixel
    color: red (2)
    position: [5, 1]
    properties:
      static: false
  - id: 3
    type: path
    color: yellow (4)
    start: [5,1]
    end: [1,7]
    properties:
       created_from: object_2

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: left_of
    subject: object_2
    object: object_1
  - type: transformation
    relation: creates
    subject: object_2
    object: object_3

actions:
    - name: extend_horizontally
      agent: object_2
      parameters:
          direction: right
          until_column_before: object_1

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate the azure (8) pixel. It remains unchanged in its original position.
2.  Locate the red (2) pixel.
3.  Create a horizontal path of yellow (4) pixels.
4.  The path starts at the position of the original red (2) pixel.
5.  The path extends to the right.
6.  The path stops one column to the left of the column containing the azure (8) pixel.
