The most obvious change is the appearance of yellow (4) pixels in the output where there were only white (0) pixels in the input. The azure (8) and red (2) pixels remain in their original positions. The yellow pixels seem to form a connected path, or line, originating from the azure pixel and extending towards, and connecting with, the red pixel. The yellow path consists of a vertical segment down from the azure pixel, and then a horizontal segment rightwards to the red pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Draw a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels, connecting the bottom end of the vertical line and moving right, to the column of the red pixel. The end result is that the yellow (4) pixels connect, forming an \"L\" shaped path from azure to red.\n4.  **Preserve** the azure (8) and red (2) pixels in their original locations in the output grid. All other pixels remain as white (0).\n"
