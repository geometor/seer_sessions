Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of numbers, representing colors.
*   The input grid primarily consists of 0 (white), with a single 2 (red) pixel and a single 8 (azure) pixel.
*    The output grid also has the 8 (azure) and 2 (red) in the same locations.
*   A vertical line of 4s (yellow) extends upwards from the 8 (azure) pixel until the row below the 2 (red)
* A horizontal line of 4's (yellow) extends to the right of where that vertical line stopped, ending just below the 2 (red) pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    type: pixel
    initial_position: [1, 8]
    final_position: [1, 8]
  - id: azure_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    type: pixel
    initial_position: [10, 2]
    final_position: [10, 2]
  - id: yellow_line
    color: yellow (4)
    type: line
    start: azure_pixel
    end_x: column of red_pixel
    end_y: row above red_pixel
    orientation: vertical then horizontal

actions:
  - type: draw_line
    object: yellow_line
    parameters:
       color: 4
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the azure (8) pixel and the red (2) pixel within the input grid.
2. **Preserve Key Pixels:** The positions of the azure and red pixels are unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Draw Vertical Segment:** Starting from the azure pixel, draw a vertical line upwards using yellow (4) pixels.
4. **Determine Line Length/Stop condition**: Stop the yellow line one row above the row the red is on.
5. **Draw horizontal segment**: Draw a horizontal line, extending right, from the end of the vertical segment. Stop at the same column where the red pixel is.

In essence, a "L" shaped yellow line connects the azure pixel to a point adjacent to the red pixel, without overlapping it. The order is a vertical line, followed by a horizontal line.
