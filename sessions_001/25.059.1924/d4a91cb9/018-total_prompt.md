Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation draws an L-shaped yellow line (4) connecting an azure pixel (8) to a position adjacent to a red pixel (2).
The azure and red pixels remain in their original positions. The L shape is formed by first drawing a vertical line upwards from the
azure pixel and stopping one row above the red pixel. Then a horizontal line to the right from the end of the vertical line,
stopping at the column where the red pixel is.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved drawing an "L" shape between an azure pixel and a red pixel. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this description is incomplete and, in some cases, inaccurate. The direction and possibly even the shape of the connection can vary. The initial assumption of an "L" shape going *up and to the right* is not universally true. It's clear now that the relative positioning of the azure and red pixels is crucial, dictating the direction of the yellow connector.

The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze each example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair to discern the specific rule governing the yellow connector's placement. Use code execution to gather hard metrics to support the assumptions.
2.  **Identify variations:** Note how the rule changes based on the relative positions of the azure and red pixels.
3.  **Generalize the rule:** Formulate a more general natural language program that accounts for all observed variations. This will likely involve conditional statements (e.g., "if the red pixel is above and to the right of the azure pixel, then...").
4. Document object properties and actions in a YAML format.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To systematically analyze, I'll use a helper function to execute and report information in each grid. I'll focus on these facts:

*   Locations of the azure (8) and red (2) pixels.
*   Dimensions of the grid.
*   Presence and shape of any yellow (4) connector.
*   Relative positions of the azure and red pixels (e.g., is red above/below/left/right of azure?).

Here's the execution of the code:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_pixel(grid, color):
    coords = np.where(grid == color)
    if len(coords[0]) > 0:
        return (coords[0][0], coords[1][0])
    return None

def analyze_grid(input_grid, output_grid):
    azure_pixel = find_pixel(input_grid, 8)
    red_pixel = find_pixel(input_grid, 2)
    grid_dims = input_grid.shape

    print(f"  Azure Pixel: {azure_pixel}")
    print(f"  Red Pixel: {red_pixel}")
    print(f"  Grid Dimensions: {grid_dims}")

    if azure_pixel and red_pixel:
        row_diff = red_pixel[0] - azure_pixel[0]
        col_diff = red_pixel[1] - azure_pixel[1]
        print(f"  Relative Position: Red is ({row_diff}, {col_diff}) from Azure")

    yellow_pixels = np.where(output_grid == 4)
    if len(yellow_pixels[0]) > 0:
      diff = output_grid - input_grid
      coords = np.where(diff == 4)
      #convert the coordinate arrays into a list of (row, col) pairs
      yellow_connector = list(zip(coords[0],coords[1]))
      print(f"  Yellow Connector: {yellow_connector}")
    else:
        print("  Yellow Connector: None")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the azure (8) and red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Relative Position:** Calculate the row and column differences between the red and azure pixels.
3.  **Draw Connector:** Draw a yellow (4) line *adjacent* to both the azure and red pixel. The line connects the closest points *adjacent* to the azure and red pixels. The line will always be vertical or horizontal, with up to one turn.
    * The connection is made by drawing a straight, one-pixel-wide line.
    * The line drawn will always be adjacent to both start and end pixel.

This revised natural language program addresses the observed variations by focusing on adjacency and relative positioning rather than fixed directions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
