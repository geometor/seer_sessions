The primary elements are two distinct colored pixels (represented by non-zero integers) in the input grid, and a path connecting these pixels is constructed in output. There may be cases where the two non-zero pixels are diagonal.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Designate one as the `StartPixel` (e.g., the one with color 8, azure) and the other as the `EndPixel` (e.g., the one with color 2, red).\n2.  **Preserve Start and End Pixels:** Copy the values/colors of `StartPixel` and `EndPixel` to the same locations in the output grid.\n3.  **Construct L-Shaped Path:** Create an \"L\"-shaped path of color 4 (yellow) connecting the `StartPixel` and `EndPixel`.\n    *   The path consists of horizontal and vertical segments only, no diagonals.\n    *   The path moves either vertically first and then horizontally, or horizontally first and then vertically, forming the 'L' shape.\n4. All the pixels between start and end pixel on L are assigned to yellow.\n\n**Further Elaboration on L-Path construction:**\n\nThe \"L\" shape can have two possible orientations depending on input position:\n\n1.  Start at `StartPixel`, extend vertically (up or down) to the row of the `EndPixel`, then extend horizontally (left or right) to the `EndPixel`.\n2.
