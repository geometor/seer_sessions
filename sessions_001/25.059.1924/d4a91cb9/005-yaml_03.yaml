    details: |
      The line starts from the azure pixel. It extends vertically (up or down) until it reaches the same row as the red pixel. Then, it extends horizontally (left or right) until it reaches the red pixel.
      The order of vertical and horizontal segments depends on the relative positions of the azure and red pixels.
      If the azure is above red, draw down then right or left.
      If the azure is below red, draw up then right or left.
      If the azure and red are on the same row, only draw horizontal.
      If the azure and red are in the same column, only draw vertical.
