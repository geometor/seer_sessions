A diagonal is a sequence of contiguous red pixels extending downwards and to the right.\n2.  **Determine Starting Point:**\n    *   If no red diagonal is found, the input grid is returned as is.\n    *   If a red diagonal *is* found, locate the last pixel (bottom-rightmost) of that diagonal. The new diagonal will start one row below and one column to the right of this pixel.\n3.  **Extend New Diagonal:** Starting from the determined starting point, change the color of cells to red (color 2) diagonally downwards and to the right.\n4.  **Terminate at Edge:** Continue this diagonal extension until either the bottom edge or the right edge of the grid is reached.\n5.  **Preservation:** All other cells that do not fall under this rule remain the same from the input.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_last_pixel_of_diagonal(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the last pixel of the longest red diagonal.\"\"\"\n    last_pixel = None\n    max_length = 0\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] == color:\n                length = 0\n                row, col = r, c\n                while row < grid.shape[0] and col < grid.shape[1] and grid[row, col] == color:\n                    length += 1\n                    row += 1\n                    col += 1\n\n                if length > max_length:\n                    max_length = length\n                    last_pixel = (row - 1, col - 1)  # Last pixel of the diagonal\n\n    return last_pixel\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the last pixel of the longest red diagonal.\n    last_pixel = find_last_pixel_of_diagonal(input_grid, 2)\n\n    if last_pixel is None:  # No red diagonal found\n        return output_grid\n\n    # Determine the starting point for the new diagonal.\n    start_row, start_col = last_pixel\n    start_row += 1\n    start_col += 1\n\n    # Extend the new diagonal.\n    while start_row < output_grid.shape[0] and start_col < output_grid.shape[1]:\n        output_grid[start_row, start_col] = 2\n        start_row += 1\n        start_col += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
