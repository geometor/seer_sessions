The input grid transforms into the output grid. The primary change seems to be the replication of a specific color (red, represented by '2') in a diagonal pattern downwards and to the right, originating from the initial position of that color in the input. The non-red colors (white '0' and azure '8') in that diagonal pattern and other parts of the board appear to remain untouched, except the azure where the new diagonal red extends.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
