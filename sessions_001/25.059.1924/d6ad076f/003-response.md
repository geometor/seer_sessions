Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of colored pixels. The colors are represented by digits 0-9. We can see distinct blocks of uniform color. The input grid has two primary colored regions: red (2) and orange (7), surrounded by white (0). The output grid introduces a new azure (8) block while preserving the red and orange regions. The azure block appears where white pixels were previously, and it seems to be related to the white region between red and orange.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: pixels
      colors: [0, 2, 7, 8]
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: rectangle
      position: top-left
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      shape: rectangle
      position: bottom-left
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: rectangle
      position: center-middle
      relation: inserted between red and orange blocks

actions:
  - type: insert
    object: azure block
    location: between red and orange blocks, replacing white pixels.

relationships:
  - red block: adjacent to azure block (above)
  - orange block: adjacent to azure block (below)
  - azure block: fills a portion of the previously white area
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the rectangular block of red (2) pixels in the top-left and the orange (7) block in the bottom-left.
2.  Locate the white (0) area separating and surrounding these blocks.
3.  Within the white area between the red and orange blocks insert a rectangle of azure (8) pixels. This new azure block horizontally spans the combined width from original block's inward x dimension from both directions. The azure extends vertically to fill the separating area.
4. Retain the shape and size of red and orange blocks.
5. Any part not in the newly formed azure rectangle remains original.
