We can see distinct blocks of uniform color. The input grid has two primary colored regions: red (2) and orange (7), surrounded by white (0). The output grid introduces a new azure (8) block while preserving the red and orange regions. The azure block appears where white pixels were previously, and it seems to be related to the white region between red and orange.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
