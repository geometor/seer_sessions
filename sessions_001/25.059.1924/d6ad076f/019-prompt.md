Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Existing Regions:** Locate the rectangular regions of green (3) at the top and maroon (9) at the bottom of the input grid. Note any all-white (0) area.
2.  **Create Azure Region:** In the center of the all-white (0) rows, insert a rectangular region of azure (8) pixels. The width of this region is 4 pixels. The azure region spans all contiguous white rows.
3.  **Maintain Boundary:** Preserve the exterior outline. All values on the rightmost column remain 0.
4.  **Preserve Regions:** Keep the locations of the green and maroon regions unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
