- objects:
    - grid: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    - regions: Areas within the grid, possibly delineated by gray lines or other patterns.
    - gray_lines: Horizontal lines of pixels with the value 5 (gray).  These may be complete or partial.
    - colors: Integer values representing colors in the grid.
    - adjacent_pixels: Pixels directly next to, or diagonal to another (specifically, a gray line).

- properties:
    - grid_dimensions: Height and width of the grid.
    - color_frequency: The number of times each color appears adjacent to a dividing line.
    - region_filling: Regions defined by gray line(s) are filled with a single color.

- actions:
    - identify_gray_lines: Locate horizontal gray lines (complete or partial).
    - determine_adjacent_colors: Find colors of pixels next to, or diagonal to a gray line.
    - calculate_most_frequent_color: Determine the most frequent color among the adjacent pixels, with a tie-breaker rule (prefer non-white).
    - fill_regions: Assign the most frequent color to all pixels within a region defined by the gray line.
    - handle_no_gray_lines: If there are no gray lines in the input, there is no valid output
