Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The most salient feature is the appearance of 3x3 blocks of uniform color in the output grid that seem to correspond to single, non-gray pixels in the input grid. The gray (5) pixels seem to act as a background or separator.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - cells: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - location: (row, column)
  - type: block
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - color: derived from a single input pixel
      - location: center aligned with the corresponding input pixel
relationships:
  - input_pixel:
    to: output_block
    rule: "If an input pixel is not gray (5), a 3x3 block of the same color is created in the output, centered on the corresponding location."
  - gray_pixel:
    to: output_pixel
    rule: "Gray pixels (5) in the input remain gray (5) in the same location."
actions:
   - name: create_block
     description: Generate a 3x3 block of uniform color in the output.
     trigger: "Non-gray input pixel."
     parameters:
        - color
        - center_location
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of the current pixel.
3.  **If** the pixel is gray (5), copy it directly to the corresponding location in the output grid.
4.  **Else (If** the pixel is *not* gray), create a 3x3 block of pixels in the output grid.
    *   The color of this 3x3 block is the same as the color of the current input pixel.
    *   The center of the 3x3 block is at the same row and column location as the current input pixel.
5. copy the grey (5) pixels as is, filling in the background

Essentially, every non-gray pixel in the input "expands" into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output, while gray pixels are unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
