objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - cells: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - location: (row, column)
  - type: block
    properties:
      - size: 3x3
      - color: derived from a single input pixel
      - location: center aligned with the corresponding input pixel
relationships:
  - input_pixel:
    to: output_block
    rule: "If an input pixel is not gray (5), a 3x3 block of the same color is created in the output, centered on the corresponding location."
  - gray_pixel:
    to: output_pixel
    rule: "Gray pixels (5) in the input remain gray (5) in the same location."
actions:
   - name: create_block
     description: Generate a 3x3 block of uniform color in the output.
     trigger: "Non-gray input pixel."
     parameters:
        - color
        - center_location
