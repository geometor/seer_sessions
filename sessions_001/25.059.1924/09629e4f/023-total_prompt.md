Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Constant Lines:** Recognize the horizontal lines of '5' (grey) pixels at rows 4 and 8 (using 1-based indexing). These lines remain unchanged in the output.

2.  **Divide into Regions:** Divide the input grid into three regions based on the constant lines:
    *   Region 1: Rows 1-3
    *   Region 2: Rows 5-7
    *   Region 3: Rows 9-11

3.  **Process Each Region:** For each of the three regions:
    *   Identify the columns with non-zero values, ignoring the gray '5' columns. Let's call this 'active_columns'
    *   Create 3x3 blocks with all colors set to 0 and the input columns marked by color '5' are the same in the ouput.
    *   Find the non-zero colors within active columns.
    *    Create a block that combines these colors using a 3x3 block, keeping the relative position.
    *   Fill output for the region with these blocks and zero background.

4.  **Combine Regions:** Combine the processed regions and the constant lines to form the final output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
