facts:
  - observation: "Grids can contain connected components of the same color."
  - observation: "Connected components are defined by orthogonal adjacency."
  - observation: "The size of a connected component affects the transformation."
  - observation: "Isolated pixels (connected components of size 1) are treated differently."
  - observation: "The background color is gray (5)."
  - observation: "Expansion occurs for components with more than one pixel"
  - action: "Expand connected components of size > 1 into a 3x3 block of the same color."
  - action: "Set isolated pixels (size 1 components) to gray (5)."
  - condition: "Expansion happens around the original pixel location, centered."
  - condition: "Existing colors in output are not overwritten during expansion beyond what the original code predicts."
