If a grey pixel exists in a row that's not entirely grey, that pixel is *not* preserved.\n\n3. **Process Each Region:** Process the entire input grid as one area, applying the following logic row by row:\n\n    *   Iterate through each row of the input grid.\n    *   Within each row, replace non-zero pixels with 0 unless they are part of a row of consistent color, in which case they should be replaced with 5.\n\n4.  **Combine:** The output grid is constructed with grey lines only when they are fully composed of grey and by changing to grey objects that are composed on horizontal rows of the same color.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_horizontal_lines(grid, color=5):\n    \"\"\"Finds rows that are entirely composed of a specified color.\"\"\"\n    lines = []\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        if np.all(row == color):\n            lines.append(i)\n    return lines\n\ndef process_row(row):\n    \"\"\"Processes a single row to create its corresponding output.\"\"\"\n    output_row = np.zeros_like(row)\n\n    # Check for full grey lines\n    if np.all(row == 5):\n        output_row[:] = 5\n        return output_row\n\n    # Find stretches of identical, non-zero, non-grey colors.\n    \n    start = -1\n    current_color = 0\n    for x, pixel in enumerate(row):\n      if pixel != 0 and pixel != 5:\n        if start == -1:\n          start = x\n          current_color = pixel\n        elif pixel != current_color:\n          #we have a different color now, process what we just saw\n          if x - start > 0:\n            #more than one pixel, color it grey\n            output_row[start:x] = 5\n          start = x\n          current_color = pixel #reset to current pixel\n      elif start != -1:\n        #end of this color run, check length\n        if x- start > 0:\n          output_row[start:x] = 5\n        #reset start\n        start = -1\n        current_color = 0\n    #handle the edge case where we ended on a color run\n    if start != -1 and current_color != 0 and (len(row) - start > 0) :\n          output_row[start:len(row)] = 5\n\n    return output_row\n    \n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Convert input to numpy array\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n\n    # Initialize output grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Process each row\n    for y, row in enumerate(input_grid):\n      output_grid[y] = process_row(row)\n    \n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
