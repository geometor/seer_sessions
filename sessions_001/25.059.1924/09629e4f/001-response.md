Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on discerning the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. Each input grid appears to have a horizontal line of grey (5) pixels dividing it into two equal halves.  Above and below this line are distinct colored regions and singular pixels. The output grids maintain the grey dividing line and have similar colored rectangular regions, but the other colors outside of those regions seem to be replaced with white (0) pixels. It seems that the regions extend three pixels in each direction. It is also important that different regions are formed in each quadrant of the input and they don't have the same position in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - color_values: 0-9 (representing different colors)
      - dividing_line:
          color: grey (5)
          position: row index 3
          orientation: horizontal
  - type: rectangular_region
    properties:
      - color: varies (not grey or white)
      - shape: 3x3 block of same-colored pixels
      - position: can be in upper or lower half, different in input than in the output.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
       - color: any of the defined colors (0 to 9)
       - position: row and column indices

actions:
  - identify_regions: locate 3x3 blocks of non-grey, non-white pixels
  - replace_pixels: change the color of pixels outside identified regions
  - keep_separator:  keep row 3 as all pixels of color 5

relationships:
  - regions_within_grid: rectangular regions are contained within the grid
  - line_divides_grid: the grey line separates the grid into two halves

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the dividing line:** Locate the horizontal line of grey (5) pixels at row index 3 in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve the dividing line:** Copy the grey line from input to output.
3.  **Locate colored regions:** Scan the input grid, both above and below the dividing line. Identify 3x3 blocks of pixels where all pixels have the same color, and that color is *not* grey (5) or white (0).
4.  **Replicate the blocks:** Copy to the output those identified 3 x 3 blocks of pixels and keeping their position in respect to the separator line.
5.  **Fill remaining pixels:** In the output grid, replace all pixels that are *not* part of the dividing line or the identified 3x3 colored regions with white (0).
