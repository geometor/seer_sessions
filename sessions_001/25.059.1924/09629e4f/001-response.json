Each input grid appears to have a horizontal line of grey (5) pixels dividing it into two equal halves.  Above and below this line are distinct colored regions and singular pixels. The output grids maintain the grey dividing line and have similar colored rectangular regions, but the other colors outside of those regions seem to be replaced with white (0) pixels. It seems that the regions extend three pixels in each direction. It is also important that different regions are formed in each quadrant of the input and they don't have the same position in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
