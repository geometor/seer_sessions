Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example pair to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (11x11).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   There's a prominent horizontal line of '5's (gray) in the middle of both input and output grids.
*   It appears some colored regions above and below the gray line in the input are getting consolidated or simplified in the output.
*   The gray line in the middle remains unchanged.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 11x11
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: 5 (gray)
      position: row 4 and row 8 in input, consistent in output
  - type: colored_region
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8] # All colors except 5.
      shape: irregular, contiguous blocks

actions:
  - type: consolidation
    description: Colored regions above and below the gray line are consolidated based on some rule related the adjacent colors in the column.
  - type: preservation
    description: The gray line is preserved without change.

relationships:
  - colored_regions: adjacent to gray_line
  - input_grid: transformed to output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve the Gray Lines:** Identify the two horizontal lines of '5' (gray) at rows 4 and 8. These lines remain unchanged in the output.
2. **Top Region Consolidation**:
    The colors of the columns above the first gray line in each column is replaced with by the most common color adjacent to the gray line at row 4.
    If no color is adjacent, use '0'.
3.  **Middle Region Consolidation:** The colors of the columns between the two gray lines in each column is replaced with by the most common color adjacent to the gray line at row 8.
     If no color is adjacent, use '0'.
4.  **Bottom Region Consolidation**: The colors of the columns below the second gray line in each column is replaced with by the most common color adjacent to the second gray line.
     If no color is adjacent, use '0'.

In more concise terms the ouput grid is made of regions defined by the gray lines. The top, middle, and bottom regions are filled by the dominant color in their respective area from the source image, adjacent to the gray line defining that section.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
