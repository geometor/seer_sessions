            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly identified the need to extend a green cluster. However, it incorrectly assumed that the extension would always be downwards and two pixels to the right. The subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern: the green cluster expands *around* existing green pixels, essentially creating a \"border\" or \"halo\" of green one pixel thick. Also, the added green pixels are contingent on blank space (white pixels, value 0) being available.  The green will not overwrite other colors.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  Analyze each example to understand the precise rules of the green expansion.\n2.  Document observations in a structured YAML format.\n3.  Refine the natural language program to reflect the updated understanding.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo better analyze I will write a report for each example.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A single horizontal line of green pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** A 3x(original length +2) green rectangle\n* **Actual Output**: a green rectangle extending the original object down to\n  the bottom and 2 to the right\n*   **Observation:** Initial hypothesis partially correct, but expansion is\n    constrained and extends in more than down and right.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 2x2 green square.\n*   **Expected Output:** A 4x4 green square.\n*   **Actual Output**: a green rectangle extending the original object down to\n  the bottom and 2 to the right\n*   **Observation:** Confirms that expansion occurs, but my algorithm isn't\n    correct.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** A diagonal line of green pixels.\n*   **Expected Output:** A larger, \"thickened\" diagonal of green.\n*   **Actual Output**: a green rectangle extending the original object down to\n  the bottom and 2 to the right\n*   **Observation:** Reinforces the \"border\" or \"halo\" concept.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n* **Input**:A single green pixel\n*   **Expected Output:** A 3x3 green square.\n*   **Actual Output**: a green rectangle extending the original object down to\n  the bottom and 2 to the right\n* **Observation**: single green pixel becomes a larger square\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: Green Cluster Expansion\nobservations:\n  - object: green_cluster\n    properties:\n      color: green (3)\n      shape: variable\n      behavior: expands\n    interactions:\n      - description: Expands to create a one-pixel thick border around the original cluster.\n        conditions:\n          - Adjacent cells must be white (0)\n        constraints:\n          - Expansion does not overwrite existing non-white pixels.\n\n```\n\n**Refined Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify** all green (value 3) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Find** the bounding box that perfectly contains the green.\n3.  **Iterate** through every cell directly adjacent (up, down, left, right, and\n    diagonals) to the original set of green cells.\n4.  **Check** If an adjacent cell is white (value 0).\n5. **Change** adjacent white cells to green.\n6.  **Return** the modified grid.\n"
