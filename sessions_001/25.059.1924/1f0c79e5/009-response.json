Specifically, there's a green (3) 2x1 vertical object and an adjacent red (2) pixel to its right. The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.\n*   **Output:** A 9x9 grid. The original green object seems to have \"grown\" or expanded diagonally downwards and to the right, creating a 3x3 green square at the bottom. The single red pixel in the input disappears, and instead replaced by a sequence of green pixels which create the diagonal shape. The original object has moved to a different corner.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
