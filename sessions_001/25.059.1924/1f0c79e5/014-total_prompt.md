Previous Code:

"""
If a green cluster exists, extend it by adding green
pixels.  Add pixels directly below each original green pixel.
Also, add two pixels to the right.  The original green
pixels should be unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_object(grid, color):
    # Find coordinates of all pixels of the specified color
    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)
    if coords.size == 0:
        return None, None, None

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly identified the need to extend a green cluster. However, it incorrectly assumed that the extension would always be downwards and two pixels to the right. The subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern: the green cluster expands *around* existing green pixels, essentially creating a "border" or "halo" of green one pixel thick. Also, the added green pixels are contingent on blank space (white pixels, value 0) being available.  The green will not overwrite other colors.

My strategy is to:

1.  Analyze each example to understand the precise rules of the green expansion.
2.  Document observations in a structured YAML format.
3.  Refine the natural language program to reflect the updated understanding.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To better analyze I will write a report for each example.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** A single horizontal line of green pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** A 3x(original length +2) green rectangle
* **Actual Output**: a green rectangle extending the original object down to
  the bottom and 2 to the right
*   **Observation:** Initial hypothesis partially correct, but expansion is
    constrained and extends in more than down and right.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** A 2x2 green square.
*   **Expected Output:** A 4x4 green square.
*   **Actual Output**: a green rectangle extending the original object down to
  the bottom and 2 to the right
*   **Observation:** Confirms that expansion occurs, but my algorithm isn't
    correct.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** A diagonal line of green pixels.
*   **Expected Output:** A larger, "thickened" diagonal of green.
*   **Actual Output**: a green rectangle extending the original object down to
  the bottom and 2 to the right
*   **Observation:** Reinforces the "border" or "halo" concept.

**Example 4:**

* **Input**:A single green pixel
*   **Expected Output:** A 3x3 green square.
*   **Actual Output**: a green rectangle extending the original object down to
  the bottom and 2 to the right
* **Observation**: single green pixel becomes a larger square

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
task: Green Cluster Expansion
observations:
  - object: green_cluster
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      shape: variable
      behavior: expands
    interactions:
      - description: Expands to create a one-pixel thick border around the original cluster.
        conditions:
          - Adjacent cells must be white (0)
        constraints:
          - Expansion does not overwrite existing non-white pixels.

```

**Refined Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all green (value 3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Find** the bounding box that perfectly contains the green.
3.  **Iterate** through every cell directly adjacent (up, down, left, right, and
    diagonals) to the original set of green cells.
4.  **Check** If an adjacent cell is white (value 0).
5. **Change** adjacent white cells to green.
6.  **Return** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
