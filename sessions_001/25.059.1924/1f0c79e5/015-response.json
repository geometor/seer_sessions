The input grid contains a small 2x2 square composed of magenta (6) and red (2) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a rotated, inverted, and possibly expanded version of the colored area, now entirely composed of magenta (6) pixels, and appearing to be a mirrored image about the line y = -x.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Fill with Magenta: all pixels on the reflection line is now magenta.\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes a small 2x2 square, reflects and inverts it across the y=-x axis, recolors the reflected area to be entirely magenta, and places this reflected shape across the y = -x diagonal.\n"
