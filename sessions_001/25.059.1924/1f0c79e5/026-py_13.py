1.  **Ignore Input:** The input grid's content and size are irrelevant.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 7x3 grid filled with white pixels (value 0). This will be the output grid.
3.  **Construct 'E' Shape:** Construct an orange (value 7) "E" shape within the output grid as follows:
    *   **Vertical Line:** Draw a vertical line of 7 pixels in the first column (column 0).
    *   **Top Line:**  Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the top of the vertical line (row 0).
    *   **Middle Line:** Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the 4th pixel down the vertical line (row 3).
    *   **Bottom Line:** Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the bottom of the vertical line (row 6).
4.  **Return Output:** The 7x3 grid with the orange "E" is the final output.
