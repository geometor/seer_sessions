Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 2x2 block of pixels in the center of the input grid, including three red(2) and one orange(7).
2.  **Isolate Key Pixel:** Determine the position of color 7 within the core 2x2 block.
3.  **Pattern Generation:** Fill the output grid with the orange color (7) according to this rule:
    *   Fill three continuous pixels with orange from the top left corner toward right and bottom side.
    *   Then add four more orange pixels from the ending point of each orange stripe by creating another adjacent line.
    *  Finally, fill one line from the end of each "L" shaped orange area.
    *   Leave remaining pixels white.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
