Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a small 2x2 square composed of magenta (6) and red (2) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a rotated, inverted, and possibly expanded version of the colored area, now entirely composed of magenta (6) pixels, and appearing to be a mirrored image about the line y = -x.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: magenta
        value: 6
      - color: red
        value: 2
    shape:
      rows: 9
      cols: 9

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: magenta
        value: 6
    shape:
      rows: 9
      cols: 9

  - name: colored_square
    type: subgrid
    location:
      input: [3,3]
      rows: 2
      cols: 2
    elements:
      top_left: 6
      top_right: 2
      bottom_left: 2
      bottom_right: 6

actions:
    - name: reflection_and_fill
      type: transformation
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: colored_square

  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: "Reflect the colored square across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and then invert, change all non-zero pixels to magenta (6), and expand the reflected shape downwards."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the colored square:** Locate the 2x2 square of non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Reflect and Invert:** Reflect the 2x2 square and invert it about the line y=-x.
3.  **Recolor:** Change all red pixels within the reflected area to magenta.
4.  **Expand:** The shape is the reflection of the original 2x2 square, across a diagonal running top left to bottom right. It extends from the bottom left corner and to the top right corner of the grid.
5. Fill with Magenta: all pixels on the reflection line is now magenta.

Essentially, the transformation takes a small 2x2 square, reflects and inverts it across the y=-x axis, recolors the reflected area to be entirely magenta, and places this reflected shape across the y = -x diagonal.
