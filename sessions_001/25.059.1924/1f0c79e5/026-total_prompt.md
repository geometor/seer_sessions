Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid filled with white pixels(0).
2.  **Shape Definition:** Define the "E" shape as a pattern: a vertical line of 7 pixels and three horizontal lines (top, middle, and bottom), each 3 pixels long, connected to the vertical line.
3.  **Drawing the Shape:**
    *   Start drawing at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.
    *   Draw the vertical line of the "E": Fill 7 pixels downwards with orange (7).
    *   Draw the top horizontal line: From the top of the vertical line, fill 3 pixels to the right with orange (7).
    *   Draw the middle horizontal line: From the 4th pixel down on the vertical line, fill 3 pixels to the right with orange (7).
    *    Draw the bottom horizontal line: From the bottom of the vertical line, fill 3 pixels to the right with orange (7).
4.  **Output:** The output grid contains the completed "E" shape in orange at the top-left corner. The rest of the output grid should remain background (white).

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Draw the vertical line of the "E" (7 pixels down)
    for i in range(min(7, rows)):
        output_grid[i, 0] = 7

    # Draw the top horizontal line (3 pixels right)
    for i in range(min(3, cols)):
        output_grid[0, i] = 7

    # Draw the middle horizontal line (3 pixels right, starting from the 4th pixel down)
    for i in range(min(3, cols)):
        if 3 < rows:
          output_grid[3, i] = 7

    # Draw the bottom horizontal line (3 pixels right, starting from the 7th pixel down)
    for i in range(min(3, cols)):
        if 6 < rows :
          output_grid[6, i] = 7

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to draw an orange "E" in the top-left corner of the output grid, regardless of the input. This approach worked for the first example because the output happened to be just that. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the output size can vary and doesn't always match the input size, and that the "E" shape is the defining characteristic. The strategy, therefore, needs to shift from *drawing* an "E" at a fixed location to *constructing* an "E" of a predefined size, irrespective of the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid will be determined by the size of the 'E' shape (7x3), if shape is always 'E'.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the code execution results:

*   **Example 1:** Input (5x5), Expected Output (7x3), Actual Output (5x5) - Correct "E" shape, but incorrect output dimensions.
*   **Example 2:** Input (11x11), Expected Output (7x3), Actual Output (11x11) - Correct "E" shape, but incorrect output dimensions.
*   **Example 3:** Input (14x14), Expected Output (7x3), Actual Output (14x14) - Correct "E" shape, but incorrect output dimensions.

Key observation is all Expected outputs have (7x3) orange "E" shape, independent of input grid.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - task_type: shape_construction
  - shape: "E"
  - color: orange
  - output_size: fixed (7x3)
  - input_size: variable, irrelevant to output
  - background_color: white
  - shape_elements:
    - vertical_line:
        length: 7
        start: (0, 0)
    - top_horizontal_line:
        length: 3
        start: (0, 0)
    - middle_horizontal_line:
        length: 3
        start: (3, 0)
    - bottom_horizontal_line:
        length: 3
        start: (6, 0)
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Ignore Input:** The input grid's content and size are irrelevant.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 7x3 grid filled with white pixels (value 0). This will be the output grid.
3.  **Construct 'E' Shape:** Construct an orange (value 7) "E" shape within the output grid as follows:
    *   **Vertical Line:** Draw a vertical line of 7 pixels in the first column (column 0).
    *   **Top Line:**  Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the top of the vertical line (row 0).
    *   **Middle Line:** Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the 4th pixel down the vertical line (row 3).
    *   **Bottom Line:** Draw a horizontal line of 3 pixels starting from the bottom of the vertical line (row 6).
4.  **Return Output:** The 7x3 grid with the orange "E" is the final output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
