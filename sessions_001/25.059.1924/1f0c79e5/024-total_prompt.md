Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 2x2 block of pixels in the center of the input grid, including three red(2) and one orange(7).
2.  **Isolate Key Pixel:** Determine the position of color 7 within the core 2x2 block.
3.  **Pattern Generation:** Fill the output grid with the orange color (7) according to this rule:
    *   Fill three continuous pixels with orange from the top left corner toward right and bottom side.
    *   Then add four more orange pixels from the ending point of each orange stripe by creating another adjacent line.
    *  Finally, fill one line from the end of each "L" shaped orange area.
    *   Leave remaining pixels white.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a pattern observed in the first training example, specifically looking for a 2x2 core and extending lines from it. This approach is too specific and doesn't generalize well to other examples in the training set. The core issue is that the generated code is rigidly tied to the structure of the first example and incorrectly assumes the existence and importance of the 2x2 block. The feedback indicates a shape-drawing operation that resembles an iterative expansion of a initial shape. The strategy should shift from finding a specific "core" to identifying a generalizable rule for drawing a specific object based on an initial element in input, then reproduce it on output.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the patterns, let's analyze each input-output pair, focusing on object identification, transformations, and any consistent rules. I'll describe the input, expected output, and generated output conceptually first and identify the key differences.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** A 2x2 block (3 red, 1 orange)
    *   **Expected Output:** An "E" shaped object in orange.
    *   **Generated Output:** Similar with "E", but located error.
    *   **Notes**: The location is based on 2x2 block in the input.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** A 2x2 block (3 red, 1 orange) in the center of grid
    *   **Expected Output:** An "E" shaped object in orange.
    *   **Generated Output:** Similar with "E", but located error.
    *   **Notes**: The location is based on 2x2 block in the input.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** A 2x2 block (3 red, 1 orange) in the center of grid
    *   **Expected Output:** An "E" shaped object in orange.
    *   **Generated Output:** Similar with "E", but located error.
    *   **Notes**: The location is based on 2x2 block in the input.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid contains a single 2x2 block of pixels.
      This 2x2 block consists of three red pixels and one orange pixel.
  - object: |
      The 2x2 block is the seed.
  - transformation_rule: |
      The output grid consistently shows an "E" shaped object colored orange. The shape is constant size.
  - object_properties:
      - name: E_shape
        color: orange (7)
        structure:  |
              Consists of a vertical line of 7 pixels and three horizontal lines of length 3.
  - location:
      - The "E" shape is always created and filled at the top-left corner in output grid.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid filled with white pixels(0).
2.  **Shape Definition:** Define the "E" shape as a pattern: a vertical line of 7 pixels and three horizontal lines (top, middle, and bottom), each 3 pixels long, connected to the vertical line.
3.  **Drawing the Shape:**
    *   Start drawing at the top-left corner (0, 0) of the output grid.
    *   Draw the vertical line of the "E": Fill 7 pixels downwards with orange (7).
    *   Draw the top horizontal line: From the top of the vertical line, fill 3 pixels to the right with orange (7).
    *   Draw the middle horizontal line: From the 4th pixel down on the vertical line, fill 3 pixels to the right with orange (7).
    *    Draw the bottom horizontal line: From the bottom of the vertical line, fill 3 pixels to the right with orange (7).
4.  **Output:** The output grid contains the completed "E" shape in orange at the top-left corner. The rest of the output grid should remain background (white).

The key improvement is to focus on the shape and size of "E" object and draw it to the top-left corner of output grid, by ignoring the positioning of the 2x2 block found within the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
