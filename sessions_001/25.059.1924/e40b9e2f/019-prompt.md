Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate the Maroon Pixel:** Find the single maroon (color code 9) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify the Azure Rectangle:** Find the azure (color code 8) rectangle in the input grid. If either the maroon pixel or the azure rectangle is not present the program stops and the original grid is returned.
3.  **Determine Mirroring Lines:**  Calculate the row indices corresponding to the top and bottom edges of the azure rectangle.
4.  **Mirror the Maroon Pixel:** Mirror the position of the maroon pixel across the top and bottom edges of the azure rectangle, calculate a new row for each.
5. **Place Maroon Pixels:** Create two new maroon pixels. Place the new pixels at the mirrored positions, overwriting any existing pixels at those locations. The output grid includes the original maroon pixel and the two mirrored maroon pixels.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
