Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify the primary shape: Find the bounding box containing all non-background (non-zero) pixels. This defines the object.
2. Swap Colors: Within the bounding box, change all yellow (4) pixels to orange (7) and all orange (7) pixels to yellow (4).
3. Reflect/Rotate: The shape is reflected.
    - If the shape is a square, reflect along both horizontal and vertical axis (which is equivalent to 180 degree rotation).
    - If the shape is a horizontal rectangle, reflect along the vertical axis.
    - If the shape is a vertical rectangle, reflect along the horizontal axis.
    - This can be implemented as a series of reflections, or a rotation.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
