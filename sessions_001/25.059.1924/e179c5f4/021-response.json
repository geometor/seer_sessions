            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a refined strategy.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the observation of a single blue pixel acting as a seed for a cross, with the seed pixel itself being replaced by azure. This worked perfectly for the first training example. However, the other examples reveal a slightly different pattern, specifically about *what* constitutes the seed. The provided code assumed the seed *must* be blue. The additional examples show that it is the *intersection* that's important, and what color it is. It seems we were a bit too focused on color 1.\n\nThe core issue is that the seed point isn't consistently defined as just a *single blue pixel*. It's better characterized as the *intersection* of existing lines, which doesn't need to be blue at all. The strategy, therefore, needs to shift from finding a specific *colored* pixel to identifying the *intersection point* of any pre-existing non-background colors. We must find those pre-existing lines and compute their intersection. The transformation then draws a cross centered on that intersection, then set the intersect pixel to azure.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo accurately assess the transformations, I'll create concise descriptions of each input/output pair and the result of the current code. I'll use numpy for analysis.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    colors = np.unique(grid)\n    desc = f\"Grid ({grid.shape[0]}x{grid.shape[1]}): Colors = {colors}\"\n    return desc\n\ndef analyze_example(example_num, input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):\n    print(f\"--- Example {example_num} ---\")\n    print(f\"Input: {describe_grid(input_grid)}\")\n    print(f\"Expected Output: {describe_grid(output_grid)}\")\n    print(f\"Predicted Output: {describe_grid(predicted_grid)}\")\n    print(f\"Correct: {np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_grid)}\")\n\n    # Check for existing lines in input\n    input_lines = []\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        if len(np.unique(input_grid[r, :])) > 1:\n            colors = [c for c in np.unique(input_grid[r, :]) if c != 8 and c!= 0] # ignore background\n            if len(colors) > 0: # consider only if different than background\n                input_lines.append(f\"Row {r}: colors={colors}\")\n    for c in range(cols):\n        if len(np.unique(input_grid[:, c])) > 1:\n            colors = [c for c in np.unique(input_grid[:, c]) if c != 8 and c!= 0]\n            if len(colors) > 0:\n                input_lines.append(f\"Col {c}: colors={colors}\")\n    if (len(input_lines) > 0):\n        print(f\"Input Lines: {input_lines}\")\n\nexamples = task_data['train']\nfor i, ex in enumerate(examples):\n    input_grid = np.array(ex['input'])\n    output_grid = np.array(ex['output'])\n    predicted_grid = transform(input_grid)  # Assuming 'transform' is defined\n    analyze_example(i + 1, input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid)\n\n```"
