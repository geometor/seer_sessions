Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all blue (1) and azure (8) pixels in the input grid. These constitute the initial seed pixels.
2.  **Preserve Seed State:** Copy the initial seed pixels (both blue and azure) from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and colors.
3.  **Alternating Expansion:**
    *   Initialize an empty queue. Add all seed pixel positions to the queue.
    *   While the queue is not empty:
        *   Dequeue a pixel position (row, column).
        *   Get the color of the current pixel in the *output* grid.
        *   Check its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        *   For each neighbor:
            *   If the neighbor is within the grid boundaries and is white (0) in the *output* grid:
                *   If the current pixel is blue (1), change the neighbor to azure (8) in the output grid.
                *   If the current pixel is azure (8), change the neighbor to blue (1) in the output grid.
                *   Enqueue the neighbor's position.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved an alternating color expansion from blue and azure seed pixels. The code successfully replicates this behavior. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this initial understanding is incomplete. Specifically, the presence of other colors (other than white, blue, and azure) in the input grid significantly impacts the transformation. The initial program assumed that only white pixels would be affected by the expansion. The new examples indicate a more complex interaction, likely involving the concept of "enclosure" or "blocking" by colors other than white.

My strategy to resolve the discrepancies is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Error Cases:** Carefully examine the input/output pairs where the code's output differs from the expected output. Focus on how the presence of non-white, non-seed colors affects the expansion.
2.  **Identify Blocking/Enclosure:** Determine if colors other than white act as barriers, preventing the alternating color expansion.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to incorporate the observed blocking/enclosure behavior.
4.  **Modify Code and Re-evaluate:**  I will describe needed changes in the code to reflect updated program, and we will execute the code again.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To better understand the behavior, I will look at simple metrics, like the number of changed pixels.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def calculate_changes(input_grid, output_grid):
    """Calculates the number of pixels that changed between input and output."""
    return np.sum(input_grid != output_grid)

def analyze_results(task):
   print(f"Task: {task['name']}")
   for i, example in enumerate(task['train']):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)  # Assuming 'transform' is your function
        changes_expected = calculate_changes(input_grid, expected_output_grid)
        changes_predicted = calculate_changes(input_grid, predicted_output_grid)
        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output_grid,expected_output_grid)
        print(f"  Example {i + 1}:")
        print(f"    Changes (Expected): {changes_expected}")
        print(f"    Changes (Predicted): {changes_predicted}")
        print(f"    Correct prediction: {correct}")

# Example usage with a hypothetical 'task' dictionary
# Replace this with a real task
task = {
'name': "Example Task",
'train': [
        {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]]},
        {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 1, 8, 2, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]]},
        {'input': [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]], 'output': [[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]},
]
}

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
