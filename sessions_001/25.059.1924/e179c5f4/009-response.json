            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program and supporting observations.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were based on the first training example. While it correctly handled the first example, it failed on subsequent examples. This indicates that the initial hypothesis was too specific and didn't capture the general rule governing the transformations.\n\nThe strategy now is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input-output pairs in the training set, including the successful and failed cases.\n2.  **Identify common patterns:** Look for consistent relationships between input and output grids that hold true across *all* examples. Pay close attention to the values that change, and the values that do not.\n3.  **Refine the rule:** Adjust the natural language program to incorporate the observed patterns, and make the rule more general. This likely means moving away from a rule based solely on row/column index sums.\n4.  **Re-evaluate:** Continuously compare observations across examples and refine program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo aid my analysis, I will generate information and reports on my assumptions, using code to count and test assertions.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(task):\n    results = []\n    for example in task[\"train\"]:\n        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])\n        predicted_output = transform(input_grid)  # using code from above\n        \n        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output, output_grid)\n        \n        diff = predicted_output - output_grid # what was the diff between expected and actual\n        \n        diff_input = output_grid - input_grid # what changed from input to output\n        \n        results.append({\n            'correct': correct,\n            'diff': diff.tolist(),\n            'diff_input': diff_input.tolist(),\n            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,\n            'output_shape': output_grid.shape,\n        })\n    return results\n\ntask = {\n    \"train\": [\n        {\n            \"input\": [[5, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 1, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 4, 7]],\n            \"output\": [[5, 8, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 1, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 4, 7]]\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [[0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 1, 5, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7]],\n            \"output\": [[8, 5, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 1, 5, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 7]]\n        },\n\t\t{\n            \"input\": [[0, 5, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 1, 5, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 1]],\n            \"output\": [[8, 5, 8, 5, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 1, 5, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 1]]\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [[0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 1, 5, 7, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 1]],\n            \"output\": [[8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5], [7, 5, 1, 5, 7, 7, 8], [7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 7, 1]]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nresults = analyze_results(task)\nprint(results)\n\n```"
