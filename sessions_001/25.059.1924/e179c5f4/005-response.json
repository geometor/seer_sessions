The input grid primarily consists of 0s (white) with a single 1 (blue) in the bottom-left corner. The output grid alternates between 8 (azure) and 1 (blue) in both rows and columns. The location of the single blue pixel in input seems to influence the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Fill first cell with 8, second cell with 1, third with 8, continue to alternate.\n    *   If the original input cell contains a '1', continue the alternating sequence based on the position. Since position [9,0] would have an '8' (based on the established alternation starting from [0,0]), and the encountered '1' occupies that theoretical '8', then the '1' becomes a starting point of a new alternating sequence, 1,8,1,8 etc.\n4. **Output:** return the filled grid.\n\nIn short, the original all 0's are changed to an alternating sequence of 8, 1, 8, 1. The single 1 also changes to the alternating sequence, but because of its position, if the sequence starting at 0,0 produces an 8 where the 1 appears, it will cause the sequence to be 1,8,1,8 starting at that point.\n"
