Most cells are white (0), with a single blue (1) cell at the bottom left corner.\n*   **Output:** A 10x3 grid. The grid now contains azure (8) and blue (1) cells. The blue cell from the input appears to have \"expanded\" or \"radiated\" in a checkered or alternating pattern.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If the adjacent cell (horizontally or vertically) is white(0) in the *output* grid, change the white to azure (8) in the output grid.\n    *   Iterate through cells adjacent to each azure(8) cell in the *output* grid. If it's a white(0) in the output grid, make it blue (1).\n5.  **Termination:** Repeat the expansion, outwards from the initial blue cell, until the entire grid is filled with only azure(8) and blue(1) in the defined alternating pattern, originating from the single starting blue pixel.\n\nEssentially, the transformation propagates outwards from the initial blue pixel. Blue pixels turn adjacent white pixels to azure, and in turn, azure pixels turn adjacent white pixels to blue. This causes the checkerboard-like pattern.\n"
