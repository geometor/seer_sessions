Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 10x3 grid. Most cells are white (0), with a single blue (1) cell at the bottom left corner.
*   **Output:** A 10x3 grid. The grid now contains azure (8) and blue (1) cells. The blue cell from the input appears to have "expanded" or "radiated" in a checkered or alternating pattern.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: [10, 3]
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        initial_state: majority
      - value: 1
        color: blue
        initial_state: single cell at [9,0]
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        initial_state: none
        final_state: surrounding the blue cell in alternating pattern

  - action: transformation
    type: replacement and expansion
    description: The single blue cell initiates a pattern of alternating blue and azure cells.
    details: |
      The blue cell maintains the value of 1. Its adjacent neighbors that were 0 become 8.
      This creates a propagation, radiating out from the initial '1'.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the 'seed':** Locate the single blue (1) cell within the input grid.
2.  **Initialize output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, and initialized with zeros.
3. **Copy the seed:** Copy the value of the blue cell (1) in the input to the same position in the output.
4.  **Alternating Expansion:**
    *   Iterate through cells adjacent to each blue(1) cell in the *output* grid. If the adjacent cell (horizontally or vertically) is white(0) in the *output* grid, change the white to azure (8) in the output grid.
    *   Iterate through cells adjacent to each azure(8) cell in the *output* grid. If it's a white(0) in the output grid, make it blue (1).
5.  **Termination:** Repeat the expansion, outwards from the initial blue cell, until the entire grid is filled with only azure(8) and blue(1) in the defined alternating pattern, originating from the single starting blue pixel.

Essentially, the transformation propagates outwards from the initial blue pixel. Blue pixels turn adjacent white pixels to azure, and in turn, azure pixels turn adjacent white pixels to blue. This causes the checkerboard-like pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
