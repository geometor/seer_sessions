The primary colors involved seem to be grey (5), red (2), and magenta (6), with a background of white (0). It looks like a specific sub-section of the input grid containing specific colors is extracted to form the output grid. The grey color is removed entirely.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this case, it's the fifth column (index 4).\n\n2. **Define extraction boundaries:**\n    * Start column for extraction: the very next column to the right, where grey ends.\n    * End column: Include all contiguous columns of red(2) and magenta(6).\n\n3.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Create the output grid by extracting all rows, and the columns from the calculated start to the calculated end.\n\n4.  **Remove Grey (5) Pixels:** Remove/Exclude any pixels that have a color of grey, leaving only red and magenta and white.\n\nIn essence, the program isolates a region of interest within the input grid, defined by its relation to a full grey column and colors, then extracts that region to form the output grid.\n"
