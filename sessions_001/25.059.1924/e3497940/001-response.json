This line serves as a consistent reference point. On either side of this line, there are colored objects, seemingly irregular in shape, but contiguous. The output grids consistently have fewer columns than the input grids, and it seems that the grey line is removed entirely. The colored objects to the left and right of the grey line \"collapse\", or are copied, but not their relative position, only on the colors present and their shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The initial dimensions of the output aren't immediately obvious, but it will be narrower than the input grid because the central grey line will be removed.\n4. **Copy** each distinct contiguous shape and its color. The relative position does not matter, only the structure of colors.\n5.  **Remove** the grey line entirely from the copied structure to obtain the final output grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation removes the grey line and keeps the colors and the shape of connected colors, but looses their relative position to each other and the grey line.\n"
