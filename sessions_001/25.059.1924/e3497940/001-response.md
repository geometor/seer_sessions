Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element of this task appears to be a vertical line of grey (value 5) pixels. This line serves as a consistent reference point. On either side of this line, there are colored objects, seemingly irregular in shape, but contiguous. The output grids consistently have fewer columns than the input grids, and it seems that the grey line is removed entirely. The colored objects to the left and right of the grey line "collapse", or are copied, but not their relative position, only on the colors present and their shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: vertical_line
    color: grey
    value: 5
    property: consistent_presence_in_input
    action: removed_in_output
  - type: colored_object
    color: variable # [yellow, green, red, magenta, azure, orange]
    value: variable # [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
    property: contiguous_pixels
    action: copied to output

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: colored_objects are adjacent to the vertical_line, and do not seem to overlap
  - type: transformation
    description: input grid transforms to output grid by removing the vertical line, retain colors and shape, but removes relative position of objects in reference to the central line.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the vertical line of grey (value 5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all contiguous colored objects (non-grey, non-white) on both sides of the grey line.
3.  **Create** an output grid. The initial dimensions of the output aren't immediately obvious, but it will be narrower than the input grid because the central grey line will be removed.
4. **Copy** each distinct contiguous shape and its color. The relative position does not matter, only the structure of colors.
5.  **Remove** the grey line entirely from the copied structure to obtain the final output grid.

Essentially, the transformation removes the grey line and keeps the colors and the shape of connected colors, but looses their relative position to each other and the grey line.
