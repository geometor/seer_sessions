            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the observation that gray pixels are removed and columns containing 7 or 8 are kept. This holds true for the first example, but fails on subsequent examples. The primary issue is that the code *only* considers columns with 7s or 8s, and the rule should consider *any* column with a value other than 0 or 5. The code makes an assumption that doesn't generalize across all training examples. By removing pixels with value 5 and any column with other non-zero values should improve results.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair to confirm consistent application of non-zero and non-five values.\n2.  **Broaden Column Selection:** Modify observation to any column with values that are not 0 or 5.\n3.  **YAML and NL Program Update:** Reflect the corrected logic in the YAML facts and the natural language program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using imagined code execution results):**\n\nI'll structure this as if I had code execution capabilities to generate precise reports. Since I don't, I'll describe the expected output of such analysis.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 11)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   `transform` Result Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Correct Pixels: 9/9 (100%)\n    *   Note: Initial program succeeds on this example.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   `transform` Result Shape: (3,0)\n    *   Correct Pixels: 0/6 (0%)\n    *   Note: Initial program fails here. Output should include columns that are not zero or gray.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 2)\n    *    `transform` Result Shape: (5,0)\n    *   Correct Pixels: 0/10 (0%)\n    *   Note: Initial program fails. Output should include the column with the azure pixel.\n\n*    **Example 4:**\n    *    Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *    Output Shape: (7, 1)\n    *    `transform` Result Shape: (7,0)\n    *    Correct Pixels: 0/7 (0%)\n    *    Note: Initial program fails.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - pixels: 2D array of color values (0-9)\n\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - pixels: 2D array of color values (0-9)\n      - derived_from: input_grid\n\nactions:\n  - description: Remove all gray (5) pixels conceptually by selecting only relevant columns.\n  - description: Filter columns.\n  - condition: Keep columns that have at least one pixel with a color value other than white (0) or gray (5).\n  - result: Create a new grid containing only the selected columns.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Column Selection:** Examine each column in the input grid.\n2.  **Filtering Criterion:** If a column contains *any* pixel that is not white (0) or gray (5), it is selected.\n3.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is formed by including the selected columns from the input, in their original order, and all the rows.\n\nIn essence, the transformation removes any column that consists *only* of white and gray pixels.\n"
