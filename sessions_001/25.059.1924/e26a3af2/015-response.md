Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid seems to retain only horizontal bands of uniform color, specifically green (3), orange (7), azure (8), and blue (1). The output appears to be a simplified or filtered version of the input, keeping only the largest horizontal stripes of certain colors and removing other colors/details.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 15
      columns: 14
      cells: [pixel values 0-9 representing colors]
  - type: horizontal_band
    properties:
       color: [green, orange, azure, blue]
       height: [varies]
       width: [extends across the entire grid width]

actions:
  - type: filter
    description: Removes pixels that are not part of the major horizontal bands.
  - type: retain
    description: Keeps the major horizontal bands of specific colors (3, 7, 8, and 1).

relationships:
   - input_grid: Contains all original pixel data.
   - output_grid: A simplified version of the input grid, containing only certain horizontal bands.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors**: The target colors that should be a part of output are green (3), orange (7), azure(8) and blue(1).
2.  **Iterate through Rows**: Scan each row of the input grid.
3.  **Identify Horizontal Bands**: Look for the contiguous runs where there are more 3 pixels.
4.  **Filter by color:** Select only the continuous lines of the target colors.
5.  **Reconstruct Output:** Create the ouput from lines of the selected colors and lines.
6. **Fill**: Replace all non-selected pixels with the color of the closest selected horizontal band above them.
