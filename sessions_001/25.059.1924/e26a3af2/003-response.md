Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example pair to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The most prominent colors in the input grid are blue (1), azure (8), green (3), and red (2). The output grid seems to be a simplified version of the input grid, retaining only the azure (8), green (3), and red (2) columns, while all other colors are replaced with blue (1). The dimensions of the prominent colored columns (8, 3, and 2) remain constant, and their relative positions are preserved. The input grid has more variety in colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [13 x 17] # Height x Width
      colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # Unique color values present
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: integer (0-9)
          position: [row, column]
  - type: column
    properties:
     color: integer
     width: integer

actions:
  - type: filter_columns
    description: Select columns based on color.
  - type: replace_color
    description: Change specified colors to another color
  - type: maintain_position
    description: preserve relative position of filtered columns

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains multiple colored columns
  - output_grid: subset of input_grid columns.
  - filtered_columns: columns with colors 8, 3, and 2.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Identify the columns in the input grid that contain only the colors azure (8), green (3), and red (2).
2.  **Filter Columns:** Keep only the target columns identified in step 1.
3.  **Replace Other Colors:** In the input grid, replace all colors *not* in the identified columns with blue (1).
4.  **Construct Output:** The output grid consists of the target columns, maintaining their original dimensions and relative positions, and all other pixels are blue(1).

Essentially, the transformation filters and keeps only the columns of azure, green, and red, turning everything else blue.
