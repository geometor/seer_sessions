The most obvious change is the removal of all colors except for blue (1), azure (8), and red (2). The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid only contains a subset of these colors. The layout and position of the remaining colors (blue, azure, and red) seem to be preserved. The transformation appears to be a filter, removing colors other than blue, azure, and red.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Actually, it does not matter, the other pixels are removed. Since there are no other azure(8) pixels, let's say we remove the colors that are not blue, red or azure.\n\nThis can be simplified as follow:\n\n1.  **Iterate through Input:** For each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  **Conditional Preservation:** Keep the pixel in the output grid at the same position *only* if its color is blue (1), red (2) or azure (8). Other colors are discarded.\n\n"
