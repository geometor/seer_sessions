Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Columns of Interest:** Examine each column in the input grid. A column is considered "of interest" if it contains *any* of the colors azure (8), green (3), or red (2). The presence of other colors in the column does *not* disqualify it.
2.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid with same dimensions and initialize it by setting all the values to blue (1).
3.  **Transfer Columns:** Copy the columns of interest from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and pixel values.
4. **Return Output Grid** Return the output grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
