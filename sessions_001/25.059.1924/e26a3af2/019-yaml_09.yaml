task: 0ca9dd7b
summary: |
  The transformation identifies horizontal stripes of colors 3 (green), 7 (orange), 8 (azure), and 1 (blue) in the input.  The output grid consists entirely of repetitions of the identified stripes, maintaining the vertical order in which they first appear. The key is that only *one* color stripe is extracted from input, and the output is a solid block of the same color.
observations:
  - object_types:
      - horizontal_stripe:
          description: A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color (3, 7, 8, or 1) extending horizontally across an entire row.  The program currently only uses one.
          properties:
            - color: The color of the pixels in the stripe (3, 7, 8, or 1).
            - row_index: The row number where the stripe is located.
  - actions:
      - identify_stripes:
          description: Locates all horizontal stripes of the target colors (3, 7, 8, and 1) in the input grid. Currently only identifies *one* horizontal stripe by finding the first matching color on each row and ignoring subsequent changes in that row.
          input: input_grid
          output: A list of stripes
      - replicate_stripes:
          description:  The entire output grid is filled with rows of the same color as identified stripes.  The output grid is filled top to bottom using the order of stripes as they appear top to bottom in the input grid.
          input: A list of stripes and output grid dimensions
          output: output_grid
