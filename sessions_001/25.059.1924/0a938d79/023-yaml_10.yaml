observations:
  - object: non-zero_pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (blue, red, green, azure)
      - position: varies
      - arrangement: can be single, contiguous blocks, or sparse
    actions:
      - expand: |
          Expand the color of the non-zero pixel(s) to fill the entire output grid. The expansion might be triggered by a single pixel or a group. The arrangement within the row (single, contiguous block, or sparse) does not seem to alter the rule. The rule is consistently applied across all examples: find non-zero pixels and propagate their color across the entire grid.
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same for input and output
    actions:
      - fill: |
        The entire grid is filled with the color(s) derived from the non-zero pixels in the input.
