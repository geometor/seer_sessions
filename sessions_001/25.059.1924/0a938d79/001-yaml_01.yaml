facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids.
    properties:
      - cells: Contain single-digit integers (0-9).
      - values: Represent colors (0 = white, 1 = blue, 2 = red, 3 = green, 4 = yellow, 8 = azure).
  - type: transformation
    description: Non-zero pixels in the input trigger replication patterns in the output.
    patterns:
      - example_1:
        input_colors: [2, 8]  # Red, Azure
        output_pattern:  Columns with the input colors alternate, and colors are extended to the full height.
      - example_2:
        input_colors: [1, 3]  # Blue, Green
        output_pattern: Columns with the input colors alternate and colors are extended to the full height of the grid.
      - example_3:
        input_colors: [2,3]
        output_pattern: Each color creates a full row of that color, and the pattern of input color rows are extended to the height of the grid, replicating
      - example_4:
        input_colors: [4,1]
        output_pattern: Each color creates a full row of that color, and the pattern of input color rows are extended to the height of the grid, replicating
