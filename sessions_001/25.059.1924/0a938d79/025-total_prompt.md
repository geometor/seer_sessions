Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color value.
2.  **Propagate Color:** For each non-zero pixel (or group of adjacent non-zero pixels of the same color), take the color value.
3. **Fill Output:** Create an output grid of the same size as the input grid and fill every cell of the output grid with the color from step 2. If there are multiple non-zero colors, they do not interact/mix - the last processed non-zero group determines the grid color.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
