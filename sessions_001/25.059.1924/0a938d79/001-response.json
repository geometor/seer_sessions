Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The transformation seems to involve replicating and/or alternating colors based on the initial positions of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid. The zero-value, representing white appears to be a background.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The colors alternate based on the columns of the non-zero input.\n    *    If the non-zero pixels are in a different row, the output expands by replicating that color across the entire row, and repeating the pattern to the entire height of the grid.\n\n3. **Construct Output:** Create an output grid of a determined or pre-set size (larger than the input grid in examples 1 and 2, but output grid height is determined by input in examples 3 and 4)\n4. Fill the output grid.\n\n    *   If the output extends the color columns, do so in the alternating order.\n    *   If the output extends rows, repeat the rows vertically, with each non-zero color filling a full horizontal line.\n\nIn summary the pattern is based on whether or not the colors detected are on the same row or not. If the detected non-zero input colors are on the same row, the transformation extends colors down each column. If the colors are on separate rows, the colors are replicated horizontally.\n"
