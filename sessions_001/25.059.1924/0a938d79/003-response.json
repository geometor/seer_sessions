The input grid appears mostly empty (white, represented by 0), with a single red pixel (2) near the top and a single azure pixel (8) near the bottom. The output grid retains the dimensions of the input grid but has a repeating pattern of the red and azure pixels, replacing the white pixels. The pattern seems to be an alternating sequence of red and azure, starting from the initial position of the red pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
