Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule creates a 2x2 checkerboard pattern using red (2) and azure (8) in the output grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The checkerboard pattern consists of repeating blocks of:

2 8
8 2

The position of the non-zero pixels in the input grid is irrelevant to the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # change output pixels 
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if (r + c) % 2 == 0:
                output_grid[r, c] = 2  # Red
            else:
                output_grid[r, c] = 8  # Azure

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
