The primary colors observed are:\n\n*   **0 (white):**  The background color, and appears to be the most frequent.\n*   **8 (azure):**  Forms a pattern, seemingly a vertical line repeated across the grid.\n* **2 (red):** Appears only as single pixels in seemingly fixed positions on the y-axis\n\nThe transformation appears to involve adding azure (8) in a specific pattern relative to existing azure and red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For every azure(8) pixel, add an azure(8) in every cell below it, extending the 'line' of azure color down to the bottom of the grid.\n4.  **Azure Addition:** For every column that contains azure, extend the lowest azure pixel down to the end of the column\n.\n5. **Result:** Maintain the Red pixels in their original Y position, regardless of other changes.\n\nIn simpler terms: It appears that the vertical lines of azure are maintained. In rows without red, the line stops at the lowest original azure. In the rows with red, the vertical line stops at the end of the grid.\n"
