Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids (input and output) of pixels, where each pixel has a color value from 0 to 9. The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The input grid appears to have vertical lines of azure pixels at specific columns and single red pixels at certain locations. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, with azure (8) pixels shifting positions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [14, 10] # rows, columns
      colors: [0, 2, 8] # white, red, azure

  - type: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: 8 # azure
      columns: [2, 6]  # Columns where azure lines are initially present

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 2 # red
      positions:
        input: [[3,9], [7,9], [11,9]]
        output: [[3,9], [7,9], [11,9]]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Columns:** Locate the columns in the input grid that contain vertical lines of azure (8) pixels. In this case, they are columns 2 and 6.
2. **Identify Red Pixels and their row index.** Find the location of red pixels in the input grid, their row number are 3, 7, 11.
3.  **Shift Azure:** For *each* identified column, move every azure (8) pixel downwards *within that column* by a number of rows equal to the row of red pixel - original row of azure pixel. If there is any red pixel.
4. If the new row index exceed the bottom, the counting continues from the top, creating a circular or wrap around behavior.
5. If there is no azure pixels, then do nothing.
6. **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels (white/0 and red/2) in the input grid remain in their original positions in the output grid.

In essence, the azure lines act as "pillars", the red act as markers, and the transformation involves a downward, circular shift of the azure pixels within each "pillar" based on the row index of red pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
