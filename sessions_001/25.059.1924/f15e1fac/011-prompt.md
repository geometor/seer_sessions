Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Columns:** Locate the columns in the input grid that contain vertical lines of azure (8) pixels.
2. **Identify Red Pixels and their row index.** Find the location of red pixels in the input grid.
3.  **Shift Azure:** For *each* identified column, move every azure (8) pixel downwards *within that column* by a number of rows equal to the row of red pixel - original row of azure pixel. If there is any red pixel.
4. If the new row index exceed the bottom, the counting continues from the top, creating a circular or wrap around behavior.
5. If there is no azure pixels, then do nothing.
6. **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels (white/0 and red/2) in the input grid remain in their original positions in the output grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
