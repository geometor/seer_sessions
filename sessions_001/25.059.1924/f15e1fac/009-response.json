The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The input grid appears to have vertical lines of azure pixels at specific columns and single red pixels at certain locations. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, with azure (8) pixels shifting positions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, they are columns 2 and 6.\n2. **Identify Red Pixels and their row index.** Find the location of red pixels in the input grid, their row number are 3, 7, 11.\n3.  **Shift Azure:** For *each* identified column, move every azure (8) pixel downwards *within that column* by a number of rows equal to the row of red pixel - original row of azure pixel. If there is any red pixel.\n4. If the new row index exceed the bottom, the counting continues from the top, creating a circular or wrap around behavior.\n5. If there is no azure pixels, then do nothing.\n6. **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels (white/0 and red/2) in the input grid remain in their original positions in the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the azure lines act as \"pillars\", the red act as markers, and the transformation involves a downward, circular shift of the azure pixels within each \"pillar\" based on the row index of red pixels.\n"
