- objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: 2x2 square
      role: trigger
      initial_state: present in all input examples
      transformed_state: changes to color 1 (blue) in all examples
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: variable, single pixel or larger
      role: target
      initial_state: present in all input examples, may be adjacent to white (0) cells
      transformed_state: expands to adjacent white cells in all directions by one cell.

- actions:
    - name: fill
      target: 2x2 green square
      result: changes the color of the square to 1 (blue)
    - name: expand
      target: blue objects
      condition: adjacent to white cells
      result: expands the blue object by converting adjacent white cells to blue (1)
- constraints:
  - Blue color (1) expands to adjacent white(0) by 1.
  - Any 2x2 green square is converted to blue.
