1.  **Locate the 2x2 Green Square:** Find the coordinates of the top-left corner of the 2x2 green square. This square serves as a reference point.

2.  **Extend Blue Pixels:**
    *   For each blue pixel in the input grid:
        * If blue pixel is on a row *above* the green square, transform the pixel on its right into blue, repeat this transformation on the next pixel to its right, repeat a total of 4 steps to the right, turning pixels blue.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good first attempt, but the test results reveal some inaccuracies. The core concept of using the 2x2 green square as a reference point seems valid, and the relative positioning logic (above, below, left, right) is on the right track. However, the details of the blue pixel extension and magenta pixel movement/deletion need refinement. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Carefully examine each failed example:** Pinpoint exactly *where* the output differs from the expected output. Identify if it's a blue pixel issue, a magenta pixel issue, or both.
2.  **Quantify the errors:** Use code execution to get precise counts of misplaced, missing, or extra pixels of each color. This will help in debugging the code.
3. **Specificity:** Make the transformation rule as specific as it needs to be
    to remove ambiguity.
4.  **Refine the natural language program:** Adjust the rules for blue and magenta pixel transformations based on the observed discrepancies, making the instructions more precise.
5. **Code Update:** generate new code using the updated and more accurate natural
    language program
6. **Iterate:** Test and gather results to find errors and update.

**Example-by-Example Analysis and Metrics**

To get accurate metrics, I'll use a simple Python script to compare the generated output with the expected output for each example. This script will count the number of correct pixels, incorrect pixels, and pixels of specific colors that are different.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """Compares two grids and returns metrics."""
    correct_pixels = np.sum(grid1 == grid2)
    incorrect_pixels = np.sum(grid1 != grid2)
    diff_colors = {}

    for color in np.unique(np.concatenate((grid1, grid2))):
        diff = np.sum(grid1 == color) - np.sum(grid2 == color)
        if diff != 0:
            diff_colors[color] = diff

    return correct_pixels, incorrect_pixels, diff_colors

# Example usage (replace with actual grids)
# Assuming 'output_grid' is from the 'transform' function and 'expected_grid' is the correct output
# correct, incorrect, diffs = compare_grids(output_grid, expected_grid)
# print(f"Correct Pixels: {correct}, Incorrect Pixels: {incorrect}, Differences: {diffs}")
```

I'll now apply this to each training example. I cannot actually execute the code, but I will make assumptions and show a template for the analysis report:

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate the 2x2 Green Square:** Find the top-left corner coordinates of the 2x2 green square. This serves as the reference point.

2.  **Extend Blue Pixels:**
    *   If a blue pixel is in a row *strictly above* the top row of the green square, transform the four pixels to its right to blue (if they exist within the grid boundaries).
    *   If a blue pixel is in a row *strictly below* the top row of the green square, transform the pixel to its right to blue (if it exists within grid boundaries).

3.  **Move/Remove Magenta Pixels:**
    *   If a magenta pixel is in a row *strictly above* the top row of the green square *and* in a column *strictly to the right* of the leftmost column of the green square, move it down one row (if the new position is within the grid boundaries), and clear the original position.
    *   If a magenta pixel is in a row *strictly above* the top row of the green square and is in the same column or *to the left* of the green square's leftmost column, remove the magenta pixel (change its value to 0).
    *   If a magenta pixel is in the *same row* as the *top* of the green square, do *not* move or change the pixel.

The critical changes here are the use of "*strictly above*" and "*strictly below*" to clarify the row comparisons and "same row" to clarify the third rule in step 3, and separating the conditions for moving vs. removing magenta pixels. The previous version missed these subtleties.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
