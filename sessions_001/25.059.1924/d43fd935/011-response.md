Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   Most of the grid is filled with '0' (white).
*   There are isolated non-zero pixels, and a 2x2 block of '3' (green) in both input and output.
*   The positions of '3' (green) are fixed.
*   The positions of '8'(azure) and '7' (orange) seem important and there are some changes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
        3: green
        4: yellow
        5: gray
        6: magenta
        7: orange
        8: azure
        9: maroon
      position: (row, column)
  - type: block
    properties:
        color: 3
        dimension: 2x2
    position: input(2,5), output(2,5)

actions:
  - type: copy
    description: Copy a 2x2 block of color 3 without any change
  - type: fill
    description: fill some single pixels of color 7 and 8

relationships:
    - input grid and output grid have identical dimensions
    - The positions of '3' are constant.
    - There is a vertical mirroring/reflection of the color 7 in relation to y=x line.
    - There is a change between color 8 in row 0 and color 8 in row 7.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** The 2x2 block of '3' (green) pixels in the input grid is copied directly to the same position in the output grid without any changes.

2.  **Mirror/Fill '7':**
    *   Iterate all the orange pixels(color 7). For all the pixels that are color 7 in input, if the mirrored position in output related to y=x is not 7, set it to 7.

3. **Mirror/Fill '8'**:

    *   Iterate all the azure pixels(color 8). For all the pixels that are color 8 in input, if the mirrored position in the output related to x=4.5 is not 8, set it to 8, EXCEPT, the element at (7,3) will always be removed.

Essentially, the transformation involves copying the green block and performing partial mirroring with color 7 related to diagonal, mirroring color 8 related to x=4.5 and removing element at (7,3).
