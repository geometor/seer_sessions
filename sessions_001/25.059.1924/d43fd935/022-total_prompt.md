Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good starting point, focusing on preserving green pixels and extending blue downwards. However, the test results on the full training set reveal that this rule is incomplete. The core issue is that the downward extension of blue isn't just one pixel; it can be multiple, and the initial logic is not iterative or recursive to capture the full extent. Specifically, the strategy should address:

1.  **Iterative Extension:** The blue extension needs to continue downwards as long as the cell below is white. The current code only checks and modifies one cell below.
2.  **Comprehensive Application:** Ensure the logic applies correctly across all examples, handling variations in grid size and blue/green pixel arrangements.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's an analysis of the results to collect important metrics and observations. I will analyze the provided result in the context of the examples.

*Example 1:*

-   Input: Blue and green pixels present.
-   Expected Output: Blue extended down where white pixels are below.
-   Actual Output: Blue extended down by only one pixel.
-  Assessment: The simple rule does capture the transformation on this data

*Example 2:*

-   Input: Blue and green pixels present, with more vertical space.
-   Expected Output: Blue extended down multiple cells where white is below.
-   Actual Output: Blue only extends down one pixel.
-   Assessment: Fails to capture the full downward extension.

*Example 3:*

- Input: Similar to the above
- Output: only one pixel down for blue
-  Assessment: similar to example 2

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Green pixels in the input grid are preserved in the output grid.
  - observation: |
      Blue pixels initiate a downward extension.
  - observation: |
      The downward extension of blue continues as long as the cell immediately below is white.
  - observation: |
      The extension replaces white pixels with blue pixels.
  - action: |
      Preserve all green pixels.
  - action: |
      Iteratively extend blue pixels downward, replacing white pixels, until a non-white pixel or the grid boundary is encountered.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Preserve Green:** Copy all green pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions.
2.  **Iterative Downward Extension of Blue:** For each blue pixel in the input grid:
    *   Begin at the cell directly below the blue pixel in the output grid.
    *   While the current cell is white and within the grid boundaries:
        *   Change the current cell to blue.
        *   Move one cell down.

This revised program accounts for the iterative nature of the blue extension, addressing the primary deficiency observed in the initial code's execution results.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
