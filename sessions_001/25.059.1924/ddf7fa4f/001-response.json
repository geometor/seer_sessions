We are given the mapping of integers to colors.\n*   **Objects:** We can consider contiguous blocks of the same color as objects.\n*   **Background:** The color 0 (white) appears to be the background.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve replacing certain objects/colors with other colors based on the object and its surrounding. It maintains the background. The single color objects existing in the top row remains the same through the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The new color for the changed object is determined by looking up the single-color pixel on the top row that resides in the same column.\n4.  The background (color 0) remains unchanged.\n5.
