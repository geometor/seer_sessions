Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 10x10 grid containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There are distinct colored regions. A notable gray (5) region exists in the center-left and extends to the middle. There are some single pixels of other colors at the top.
*   **Output Grid:**  Also a 10x10 grid with the same dimensions as the input. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid. The gray (5) region in the input has been replaced, and other regions take those colors.
* **Colors**: It is important to convert numerical values to colors, to help discern.
    *   0: white
    *   2: red
    *   5: gray
    *   6: magenta
    *   8: azure

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Initial state of the grid.

  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Transformed state of the grid.

  - id: gray_region
    type: object
    color: 5 (gray)
    shape: irregular
    location: center-left, extending to the middle of input_grid
    description: A contiguous block of gray pixels.

  - id: top_row_pixels
    type: objects
    colors: [2 (red), 6 (magenta), 8 (azure)]
    location: top row of input_grid
    shape: single pixels
    description: three distinct pixels in the top row of the input grid.

  -id: red_region
    type: object
    color: 2 (red)
    shape: rectangular-like
    location: replaces part of grey_region on the left

  -id: magenta_region
    type: object
    color: 6 (magenta)
    shape: rectangular-like
    location: replaces part of grey_region in the middle

  -id: azure_region
    type: object
    color: 8 (azure)
    shape: rectangular-like
    location: replaces part of grey_region on the bottom right

actions:
  - type: replacement
    description: The gray region in the input is replaced by regions of other colors, that appear in the top row.
    agent: unknown
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Identify the colors present as single pixels in the top row of the input grid (excluding white/0). In this case, these are red (2), magenta (6), and azure (8).

2.  **Locate the Gray Region:** Identify the contiguous region of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.

3.  **Replace Gray with Top Row Colors:**
    *   Replace the leftmost part of the gray region with a rectangular-like region of red (2). The vertical extent of red region aligns with the full height extent of the original grey region.
    *   Replace the central part of the gray region with magenta (6) of same dimensions, to the right of the red region.
    *    Replace the bottom-right part of the grey region with azure (8) of same vertical extent.

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not part of the central gray region remain unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation involves selectively replacing the gray region based on the colors found in the top row, using a defined spatial pattern (left-to-right and maintaining a block-like structure) with the colors on the top row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
