Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   The top row of both input and output appears identical.
*   The central block of gray (5) pixels in the input seems to be replaced, based on the colors present in that first row.
*   It's critical to note the *positions* of the non-zero colors on the top row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      color: integer
      shape: rectangle

actions:
  - name: replace_block
    agent: system
    input: color_block, reference_colors
    output: modified_color_block

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: pixels are arranged in a grid.
  - type: correspondence
    description: Specific colors in the top row determine replacement colors in the central block.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Reference Colors:** Observe the colors and their positions in the first row of the input grid. These are the "reference colors."
2.  **Locate Target Blocks:** Identify the contiguous blocks of color in the rest of the grid.
3. **Map Input to Output** For the given input, gray (5) is mapped to blue(1), yellow(4) maps to yellow (4), and orange (7) maps to orange (7). The colors, blue (1), yellow (4), and orange (7) correspond to the reference color on the top row of the input.
4.  **Replace Colors:** For each block below the top row, replace all the pixels with the value, matching the reference colors on the top row of the input grid.

In essence, the transformation uses the colors in the top row as a key to recolor blocks in the lower part of the grid. The program replaces portions of the lower grid based on the colors present in the first row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
