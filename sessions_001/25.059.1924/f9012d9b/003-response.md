Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The colors in the input grid are red (2), blue (1), and white (0). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on a specific region of the input. The colors in the output are blue and red, meaning the output grid only represents non-white pixels. The shape of the input is 5x5 and the output is 2x2.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, blue, white]
      shape: 5x5
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, blue]
      shape: 2x2

actions:
  - name: condense
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Selects a specific sub-region of the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output_grid corresponds to the top-right 2x2 sub-grid of the input grid, ignoring any white space.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region:** Focus on the top-right 2x2 corner of the input grid.
2. **Extract Subgrid**: extract the colors of that corner.
3. **Create Output:** Construct a 2x2 output grid using the non-white color values, in the order as they appear in that region.
