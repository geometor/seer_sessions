The colors present in the input are red (2), gray (5), and white (0). The output grid seems to be a highly compressed version of the input, retaining only some of the original colors and significantly reducing the dimensions. The output grid does not seem to preserve spatial configuration of colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
