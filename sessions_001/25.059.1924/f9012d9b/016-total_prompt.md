Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller 2D grid. The colors present in the input are red (2), gray (5), and white (0). The output grid seems to be a highly compressed version of the input, retaining only some of the original colors and significantly reducing the dimensions. The output grid does not seem to preserve spatial configuration of colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: pixels
      properties:
        colors: [red, gray, white]
        dimensions: [variable, variable] # Height and width can change
  - pixel:
      type: individual cell
      properties:
        color: integer (0-9)

actions:
  - transform:
      input: grid
      output: smaller_grid
      description: Reduces the input grid to a smaller grid containing a subset of colors from the original grid

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: pixels
  - output_grid_contains: pixels
  - pixel_has_color: color

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Unique Colors:** Examine the input grid and create a list of the unique colors present, *excluding* white (0).
2. **Create Output Grid**: Create a small, unspecified size, rectangular output grid and add the collected unique colors into the output grid. The pattern appears arbitrary.

In summary, the transformation seems to create a 2x2 grid using pixels from two of the distinct colors in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
