          The input pattern consists of vertical pairs, alternating the positions in two columns, keeping relative y-coordinates the same.

  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - shape: square
            color: green

        notes: >
          A single colored square is present, and it stays in its original location and shape.

  - example_3:

        notes: >
            A single colored rectangle stays in place.
