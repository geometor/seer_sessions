A shape is defined as a group of one or more adjacent pixels of the same color. Diagonal adjacency is included in the definition of adjacency.\n2.  **Extract Colors:** For each identified shape, extract the numerical color value of the pixels within that shape.\n3. **Order colors:** Create an ordered sequence of the extracted colors. The ordering does not seem to follow any apparent rule besides that it should contain the color values, exactly once.\n4.  **Output Sequence:** Output the sequence as a column vector.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_shapes(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous shapes in a grid.\"\"\"\n    shapes = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, current_shape):\n        \"\"\"Depth-first search to find contiguous pixels of the same color.\"\"\"\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        current_shape.append((row, col))\n        # Check all 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(row + dr, col + dc, color, current_shape)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[row, col] and grid[row, col] != 0:\n                current_shape = []\n                dfs(row, col, grid[row, col], current_shape)\n                if current_shape:\n                    shapes.append((grid[row,col], current_shape))  # Store color and shape\n    return shapes\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Find shapes in the input grid\n    shapes = find_shapes(np.array(input_grid))\n\n    # Extract the color of each shape\n    colors = []\n    \n    for color, _ in shapes:\n        colors.append(color)\n    \n    colors = sorted(list(set(colors)))\n\n    return colors\n```"
