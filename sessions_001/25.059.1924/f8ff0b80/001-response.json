The background is consistently color 0 (white).  The objects are contiguous regions of non-zero color. The order in the output seems significant, and likely related to some property of the objects in the input. It's not alphabetical, not by size, and not simply left-to-right, top-to-bottom.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Each region represents a single object.\n\n2. **Extract Object Colors:** For each identified object, record its color value.\n\n3. **Sort by a consistent rule:** The critical observation is that each input grid contains *different colored* objects. There must be an order. Looking at the order in the examples, and keeping in mind the color map, I see that it is not by object size, or position, but the colors themselves may have an inherent order - the integer value.  If we consider the order to be from lowest integer value to highest, it does not work, but if we consider the order to be *highest to lowest*, it *does* match the example transformation data. The natural language program would thus be:\n\nSort the colors in descending order *of their integer representation*.\n\n4.  **Output:** Create a 1D list containing the color of each object, ordered by the rule discovered in the previous step.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule is to identify the distinct colored objects in the input grid, extract their colors, sort the color values in descending order, and output the sorted list.\n"
