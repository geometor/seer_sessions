"""
1. **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red (2) pixels in the input grid.

2. **Vertical Extension:** For each red pixel, extend it vertically upwards and downwards, replacing white pixels with copies of the red one. Do this until the top and bottom edges of the grid are reached by the red shape.

3. **Azure Pixel Modification:**
    * Examine all azure (8) pixels.
    * If an azure pixel is directly adjacent to a vertically extended red pixel created in step 2 (above, below, to the left, or the right, but not diagonal), change its color to red (2).
    * Create white pixels (0) between areas of red and azure, if necessary.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code has several issues. It correctly identifies and extends the red pixels vertically. However, the logic for handling azure pixels is flawed. It appears to attempt to make azure pixels red if _anywhere_ adjacent to red and *then* attempts to set some azure pixels to white, which is confusing. The core problem is that it's not correctly identifying *which* azure pixels should become red and which should become white. It also lacks a concept of maintaining existing red pixels unless connected to the extended ones.

The strategy to resolve this will be:

1.  **Verify Assumptions with Metrics:** Use `code_execution` where needed to confirm observations by checking specific pixel values and locations in both the input, expected output, and the actual output generated by my code. I am particularly interested in azure pixels that neighbor any red pixel and in white pixels.

2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define "objects" (contiguous regions of the same color) and their relationships (adjacency).

3.  **Re-evaluate Azure Pixel Logic:** The key is to accurately describe the conditions under which an azure pixel changes to red *or* white. This likely involves adjacency to the *extended* red lines, not just any red pixel.

4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Based on analyzing *all* training examples, adjust the natural language program step-by-step, focusing on precision and clarity.

**Example-by-Example Metrics and Observations (with Code Execution when Needed):**

Let's use code_execution to check assumptions and results of the first few
examples, and use those to build the first report.

def get_grid_string(grid):
  return '\n'.join(''.join(str(cell) for cell in row) for row in grid)

    """Compares two grids and returns a grid showing the differences."""
    diff_grid = np.zeros_like(grid1)
    for i in range(grid1.shape[0]):
        for j in range(grid1.shape[1]):
            if grid1[i, j] != grid2[i, j]:
                diff_grid[i, j] = 1  # Mark differences with 1
    return diff_grid

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_line
    color: red (2)
    shape: vertical line
    behavior:  originates at an initial red pixel, grows up and down to edges
  - name: azure_block
    color: azure (8)
    shape: contiguous block
    behavior: transforms to red if adjacent to red_line, transforms to white (0) otherwise

actions:
  - name: extend_red
    input: red pixel
    process:  create a vertical line of red pixels extending to grid boundaries
  - name: transform_azure
    input: azure_block, red_line
    process: if an azure pixel within azure_block is adjacent to any pixel of red_line, change it to red; otherwise change to white

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Initial Red:** Identify all red (2) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Extend Red Vertically:** For *each* initial red pixel, create a vertical line of red pixels extending upwards and downwards to the top and bottom edges of the grid. This forms the `red_line` objects.

3.  **Transform Azure:** Identify all azure (8) pixels. For *each* azure pixel:
    *   If the azure pixel is adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally) to *any* pixel in a `red_line`, change the azure pixel to red (2).
    *   Otherwise, change the azure pixel to white (0).

The key improvements here are (a) explicit vertical line creation, (b) the adjacency check for azure is against the *extended* red lines, and (c) the "otherwise" condition for azure pixels. The addition of object names enhances clarity.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
