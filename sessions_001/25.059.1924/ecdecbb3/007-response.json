            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were a good first attempt, correctly handling the vertical extension of red pixels and the conditional transformation of azure pixels based on adjacency. However, the test results reveal that the adjacency check needs to consider not just any red pixel, but specifically pixels that are part of the *original* red lines, and it did not correctly handle the adjacency. The current implementation incorrectly transforms azure to red if they're adjacent to *any* red pixel, including those added during the vertical extension. It also implemented the adjancency check incorrectly.\n\nThe strategy for improvement will involve:\n\n1.  **Maintaining Original Red Line Information:** The code needs to distinguish between the initial red pixels and the ones added during the vertical extension. We can store the coordinates of vertical lines separately.\n2.  **Revised Adjacency Check:** The adjacency check for azure pixels should only consider the initial vertical red line pixels, not the extended ones.\n3. **Correct adjacency.** Ensure that we check horizontal and vertical, but not diagonal.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the results for each example, including a description, and observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: Single red pixel, several azure pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Red line, some azure pixels turned red, others to white.\n    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.\n    *   Observation: The initial logic holds for this basic case.\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: Two red pixels, azure pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Two red lines, specific azure-to-red transformations.\n    *   Actual Output: All azure turns to red.\n    *   Observation: The extended red lines are treated the same as that original during the adjacency check which gives an incorrect result.\n\n*    **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: Two red pixels, azure pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Two red lines, specific azure-to-red transformations.\n    *   Actual Output: All azure turns to red.\n    *   Observation: The extended red lines are treated the same as that original during the adjacency check which gives an incorrect result.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  red_lines:\n    description: Vertical lines of red pixels originating from initial red pixels.\n    properties:\n      origin: (row, col) - Coordinates of the initial red pixel.\n      color: red (2)\n  azure_pixels:\n    description: Individual azure pixels.\n    properties:\n      color: azure (8)\n      adjacent_to_red_line: Boolean - True if adjacent to an original red_line, False otherwise.\n\nactions:\n  extend_red_vertically:\n    description: Extends each initial red pixel into a vertical line spanning the grid height.\n  transform_azure:\n    description: Changes azure pixels to red if adjacent to an original red_line, otherwise to white.\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Red Pixels:** Locate all red (2) pixels in the input grid. These mark the origins of the red lines.\n\n2.  **Define Red Lines:** For each initial red pixel, create a vertical \"red\\_line\" object. This object is conceptually a vertical line extending from the top to the bottom of the grid, passing through the initial red pixel's column. It is important to only store the column and the original row.\n\n3.  **Extend Red Vertically (Visually):** For each initial red pixel, extend red color vertically upwards and downwards to the grid's edges.\n\n4.  **Transform Azure Pixels:** Identify all azure (8) pixels. For each azure pixel:\n    *   Check Adjacency to Original Red Line: Determine if the azure pixel is horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) adjacent to *any* pixel that belongs to the original red\\_line defined in step 2 (only check column not the extended red).\n    *   Conditional Transformation:\n        *   If adjacent to an original red\\_line, change the azure pixel to red (2).\n        *   Otherwise, change the azure pixel to white (0).\n"
