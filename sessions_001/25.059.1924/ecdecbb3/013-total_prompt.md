Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate the two vertical azure (8) lines in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Red:** Find the red (2) region (contiguous horizontal block of red pixels).
3.  **Expand:** Extend the red region horizontally to the left and right until it touches the azure lines.
4.  **Fill Azure:** In the row immediately below the expanded red region, place an azure (8) pixel directly below where the red region *begins* and *ends* its expansion (if those positions are adjacent to the azure columns). Azure pixels are placed only if there's an azure line adjacent to the expansion point. The original azure lines stay.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
