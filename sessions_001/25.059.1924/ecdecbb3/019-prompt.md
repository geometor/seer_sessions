Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Red Pixel Column Extension:** Identify all columns containing red (2) pixels in the input grid. For each of these columns, create a column of red pixels in the output grid that spans the entire height of the grid.

2.  **Azure Line Identification:** Identify all horizontal lines of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.

3.  **Azure Pixel Placement, with Red Column Interaction:**
    *   For each azure line identified:

        *   Iterate through the columns, checking if an azure pixel from the input line intersects with any of the red columns.
        *   Iterate through the columns, if a column does *not* intersect the red columns, maintain an azure pixel at the row of the azure line.
        *   If there are no non-intersecting columns, the output grid does not include an azure pixel for the current azure line.

4. The output has at most one azure pixel.

5. The output grid should have the background filled with 0/white.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
