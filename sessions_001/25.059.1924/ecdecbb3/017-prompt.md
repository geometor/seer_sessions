Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Red Pixel Replication:** For each red (2) pixel in the input, replicate it vertically downwards and upwards to create a column of red pixels. The column spans from row 0 and down to the max length of original grid.

2.  **Azure Line Interaction:** For each horizontal azure (8) line in the input, examine each of its constituent azure pixels, specifically checking its column.

3. **Combination:**
    - Check for overlap between the red pixel columns from Step 1, and the existing azure pixels.
    - If an azure pixel in the input shares the same column index as a replicated red pixel column, keep the red color.
    - If an azure line pixel is not located in the column of replicated red, keep the azure pixel in the output at the input grid position.
4. The final output is composed of a the white background, plus the modified pattern of red pixels and blue lines.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
