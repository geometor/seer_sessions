Diagonal neighbors are not considered for corner identification.\n3. **Change Corners to Yellow:** Change color of identified corner pixels from gray (5) to yellow (4).\n4. **Output:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except with the identified corner pixels changed to yellow.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_gray_shape(grid):\n    # Find all gray pixels\n    gray_pixels = np.argwhere(grid == 5)\n    return gray_pixels\n\ndef is_outer_corner(grid, row, col):\n    # Check if a gray pixel is an outer corner\n    gray = 5\n\n    if grid[row, col] != gray:\n        return False\n\n    # Count adjacent neighbors (horizontal/vertical only)\n    neighbors = 0\n    neighbor_coords = []\n    if row > 0 and grid[row-1, col] == gray:\n        neighbors += 1\n        neighbor_coords.append((row - 1, col))\n    if row < grid.shape[0] - 1 and grid[row + 1, col] == gray:\n        neighbors += 1\n        neighbor_coords.append((row + 1, col))\n    if col > 0 and grid[row, col - 1] == gray:\n        neighbors += 1\n        neighbor_coords.append((row, col - 1))\n    if col < grid.shape[1] - 1 and grid[row, col + 1] == gray:\n        neighbors += 1\n        neighbor_coords.append((row, col + 1))\n\n    # Check if it's an outer corner (exactly two neighbors, and they are adjacent)\n    if neighbors == 2:\n        row1, col1 = neighbor_coords[0]\n        row2, col2 = neighbor_coords[1]\n        if (abs(row1 - row2) == 1 and col1 == col2) or \\\n           (abs(col1 - col2) == 1 and row1 == row2):\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find gray shape pixels\n    gray_pixels = find_gray_shape(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate and find outer corner locations, replace them with yellow\n    for row, col in gray_pixels:\n        if is_outer_corner(output_grid, row, col):\n            output_grid[row, col] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
