The transformation introduces a third color, yellow (4). The transformation appears to be localized and related to specific configurations of gray pixels. It seems like compact gray areas are being filled or replaced by yellow. The output maintains the overall structure and dimensions of the original input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A contiguous region is defined as a group of gray pixels that are directly adjacent (not diagonal).\n\n2.  **Shape Analysis:** Analyze the shape of each gray region. Differentiate between \"line-like\" regions (thin, elongated) and \"blob-like\" regions (compact, potentially enclosed).\n\n3. **Conditional Filling**:\n    *    If a gray region is classified as a \"blob,\" meaning a closed or nearly-closed shape that contains no white cells on it's interior, replace all the gray (5) pixels *within that region* with yellow (4) pixels.\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the gray regions that have been filled with yellow according to the rule above.\n    Line like segments of grey pixels should not be changed.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies and fills enclosed, or nearly enclosed, gray areas with yellow, while leaving elongated gray lines untouched.\n"
