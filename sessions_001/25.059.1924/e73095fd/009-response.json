These pixels form the boundary of a shape.\n2.  **Determine the Interior:** Identify all pixels with the value '0' (white) that are enclosed *completely* by the boundary pixels. This requires determining which '0' pixels are \"inside\" the shape formed by the '5' pixels.\n3. **Fill the Interior:** change the color of all the pixels found inside the boundary at step two, set the cell value to '4' (yellow).\n4.  **Preserve the Exterior:** All the pixels that are not a '5' and not the interiror are unchaged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies a closed shape formed by gray (5) pixels and fills its interior with yellow (4) pixels, leaving the rest of the grid unchanged. The core concept is identifying the enclosed region.\n"
