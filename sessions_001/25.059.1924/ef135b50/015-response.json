The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and maroon (9). The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (10x10). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some pixels from white (0) to maroon (9). These changes are not random; they appear to be related to the spatial arrangement of the white and red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
