However, the provided results indicate that while this works perfectly on `train_0`, it is not correct for the other examples in the training set.\n\nMy strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine *each* input/output pair, including those where the current code succeeds and fails.  This involves not just looking at the grids visually, but also using code execution to programmatically confirm observations (e.g., \"Is pixel (x,y) adjacent to red?\"). This is what the metrics section below will focus on.\n2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will revise the natural language program. It's likely the initial rule was too simplistic. The additional examples might involve additional constraints.\n3.  **Iterative Improvement:** The process is iterative. I'll provide the revised natural language program, which will then be used to generate new Python code. We'll repeat the validation process.\n\n**Metrics and Code Execution**\n\nI'll use `code_execution` to verify properties and gather data.  Here's a plan and the results from train_0, train_1, train_2, and train_3:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_results(task_name, input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output):\n    print(f\"--- Analysis of

**Identify** all red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.\n3.  **Check** the edges of the grid for any white pixels adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally) to a red pixel.\n4.  **If** a white pixel is at the edge and adjacent to a red pixel, change its color to maroon (value 9).\n5.  **Check** for any white pixels located *between* two red pixels either horizontally or vertically.\n6.  **If** a white pixel is located between two red pixels, change its color to maroon (value 9)\n7.  **If** a white pixel doesn't meet the above conditions, leave as original color(0).\n8.  **Output** the modified grid.\n\nThe change here is subtle but important, adding the condition about edge and between. The initial program was close, but the failing test cases showed it wasn't comprehensive enough. This refined description accounts for the \"edge cases\" more precisely. The original was a subset of a broader rule.\n"
