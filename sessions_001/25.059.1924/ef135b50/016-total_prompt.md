Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value represented by an integer (0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and maroon (9). The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (10x10). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some pixels from white (0) to maroon (9). These changes are not random; they appear to be related to the spatial arrangement of the white and red pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [0, 2, 9]
          mapping:
            0: white
            2: red
            9: maroon

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0,2,9]
      - position:
        type: coordinate (row, column)

actions:
    - type: change_color
      agent: system # Implicit agent performing the transformation
      from: 0 #white
      to: 9 #maroon
      conditions:
        - spatial_relationship: "adjacent to red(2)"

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: pixels
    properties:
      - direction: [horizontal, vertical] # Diagonal adjacency is NOT considered
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all white pixels (value 0) in the input grid.

2.  **Inspect** each identified white pixel.

3.  **Check** if the white pixel is adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally) to a red pixel (value 2).

4.  **If** a white pixel is adjacent to a red pixel, change its color to maroon (value 9).

5.  **If** a while pixel is not adjacent to any red pixel, leave as original color(0)

6. **Output** new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
