The transformation rule is to identify a cross-shaped object made of yellow pixels in the input grid, 
determine its boundaries, and then fill the bounding box defined by those boundaries with yellow pixels, 
and finally cropping rows and columns that are all white at the image boundary.

    # Fill the bounding box with yellow.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of finding a yellow cross and filling its bounding box. However, the additional training examples reveal a flaw: the initial approach of simply filling the entire bounding box with yellow is too simplistic. The actual transformation involves extending the *arms* of the cross to the boundaries, not filling the entire bounding box encompassed by the cross. Also, the cropping operation must be the final step.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Instead of just finding yellow pixels, we need to specifically identify the "arms" of the cross. This might involve analyzing the connectivity of the yellow pixels.
2.  **Extend Arms, Not Fill Bounding Box:** The core logic needs to change from filling a rectangle to extending the existing lines of the cross outwards.
3. **Ensure Cropping is last** The crop operation should be the last step.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

    output_yellow_pixels = np.sum(output_grid == 4)
    predicted_yellow_pixels = np.sum(predicted_output == 4)


    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    output_shape = output_grid.shape
    predicted_shape = predicted_output.shape

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the yellow pixels in the input grid that form a cross shape. A cross is defined as a central pixel with four "arms" extending outwards in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). The arms can be of any length (including zero, meaning just the center pixel is present). There will only be one cross.
2.  **Extend the Arms:**  For each arm of the cross, extend it outwards in its respective direction until it reaches the edge of the input grid. This extension should maintain a straight line and be composed of yellow pixels.
3. **Create the Filled Rectangle:** Create a filled rectangle using yellow (value 4) from the extents of each arm.
4.  **Crop:** Remove any rows or columns on the edges of the grid that are entirely composed of white pixels (value 0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
