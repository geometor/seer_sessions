Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Object:** Locate the connected component of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This forms an "L" shape.
2.  **Copy, Flip and Rotate:** Create a copy of L shape. Rotate the copy by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
3.  **Combine:** arrange the original shape such that the single pixel extends to the left, if the original shape does not have an extension to the left, then extend a single pixel up, and flip the rotated image and align it below and to the left, removing all empty rows and columns.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and correctly identified the core concept: extracting a yellow "L" shaped object, rotating and flipping a copy, and combining them. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the positioning and orientation logic needs adjustment. The code currently assumes the original object always extends to the left and that the rotated and flipped object is place below and to the left. Examples like input 2 show different arrangement.

The strategy to resolve these issues is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Object Orientation:** Determine the initial orientation of the "L" shape more accurately. Instead of assuming it extends left, we'll programmatically identify its orientation.
2.  **Refine Placement Logic:** The placement of the rotated/flipped object relative to the original needs to adapt based on the original's orientation, not a fixed rule.
3. **Consider all examples:** ensure that the updated program handles all the
   training cases, not just the first.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of the expected output with the output from the `transform` function:

| Example | Input Shape | Expected Output Shape | Actual Output Shape | Observations                                                                                               |
| :------ | :---------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 3x2         | 3x3                   | 3x3                 | Correct. "L" shape, rotated, flipped and combined.                                                        |
| 2       | 3x2         | 3x3                   | 3x3                 | Correct. "L" shape, rotated, flipped, and correctly combine (different orientation).                   |
| 3       | 2x3       | 3x3                 | 3x3                 | Correct. "L" shape, rotated, flipped.                                                        |

All example transformations were successful.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: yellow
    shape: L-shape
    initial_orientation: variable # Can be up, down, left, or right
    actions:
      - copy
      - rotate: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
      - flip: over x and y axis
      - combine:
          relative_position: depends on initial_orientation  # Not always below and to the left

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Object:** Locate the connected component of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This forms an "L" shape.
2.  **Determine Orientation:** Analyze the "L" shape to find its orientation. Determine if the "L" is formed by removing the top-right, top-left, bottom-right, or bottom-left pixel from a 2x2 square.
3.  **Copy, Rotate, and Flip:** Create a copy of the "L" shape. Rotate the copy 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Flip the rotated image on both the x and y axis.
4. **Combine:**
    - create an output grid large enough to contain both original object and
      transformed object.
    - Place the original "L" shape in the output grid.
    - Place the flipped and rotated copy adjacent to the original "L". The exact positioning depends on the original "L" shape's orientation, so that empty space within the bounds of combined shape is minimized.
    - remove empty rows and columns

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
