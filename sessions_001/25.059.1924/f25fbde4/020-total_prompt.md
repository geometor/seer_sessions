Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Yellow Shape:** Locate all yellow (value 4) pixels in the input grid. This constitutes the initial shape.

2.  **Create the Frame:**
    - Create a new grid with the height of original shape + 2, and width of original shape + 1.

3.  **Copy and Frame**:
    - Copy the original shape into the new grid, offset by one row down, and one column to the right.
    - Fill the top row, beginning at column 0, with yellow.
    - Fill the bottom two rows with yellow.

4. **Return Results** Return the expanded grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, and the function does correctly reproduce the output for example 1. It correctly identifies the yellow pixels, creates a new grid, and copies the shape with an offset. The error is in filling in the frame, since the program assumed a frame of solid yellow that is 1 row above and 2 rows below the shape.

However, the code fails to correctly transform input for other examples. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of the framing rule. The generated code always fills in the top row and the bottom two rows with yellow. Looking at example 2 and 3, the new framing rule is:
  - the top row, offset by one column to the left
  - the bottom two rows

Therefore, we will modify the function to correct the frame.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformation, let's analyze each example, comparing the input and output grids, and noting the results of the current code:

```python
def code_execution(input_grid, expected_output, generated_output):
    """Executes the transform function and compares the output.
      Also provides metrics and simple descriptions.
    """
    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output_np = np.array(expected_output)
    generated_output_np = np.array(generated_output)
    
    input_shape = input_grid_np.shape
    output_shape = expected_output_np.shape
    generated_shape = generated_output_np.shape
    
    correct = np.array_equal(expected_output_np, generated_output_np)

    print(f"  Input shape: {input_shape}")
    print(f"  Expected output shape: {output_shape}")
    print(f"  Generated output shape: {generated_shape}")    
    print(f"  Correctly generated: {correct}")

# Example usage (assuming 'train' contains the examples)
# Example usage
for i, example in enumerate(train):
  print (f"Example: {i +1}")
  generated_output = transform(example['input'])
  code_execution(example['input'], example['output'], generated_output)
```

**Example: 1**
```
  Input shape: (3, 3)
  Expected output shape: (5, 4)
  Generated output shape: (5, 4)
  Correctly generated: True
```
**Example: 2**
```
  Input shape: (2, 4)
  Expected output shape: (4, 5)
  Generated output shape: (4, 5)
  Correctly generated: False
```
**Example: 3**
```
  Input shape: (4, 2)
  Expected output shape: (6, 3)
  Generated output shape: (6, 3)
  Correctly generated: False
```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input_object: Yellow rectangle of size 3x3.
      transformation:  The rectangle is copied into a larger grid, offset one row down, and one column to the right.  A yellow border is added: the top row beginning one position to the left, and the bottom two rows.
      output_object: Yellow shape with dimensions 5x4.
      correct: True
  - example_2:
      input_object: Yellow rectangle of size 2x4.
      transformation: The rectangle is copied into a larger grid, offset one row down, and one column to the right. A yellow border is added: the top row beginning one position to the left, and the bottom two rows.
      output_object: Yellow shape with dimensions 4x5.
      correct: False
  - example_3:
      input_object: Yellow rectangle of size 4x2.
      transformation: The rectangle is copied into a larger grid, offset one row down, and one column to the right. A yellow border is added: the top row beginning one position to the left, and the bottom two rows.
      output_object: Yellow shape with dimensions 6x3.
      correct: False
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Yellow Shape:** Locate all yellow (value 4) pixels in the input grid. This forms the original shape.

2.  **Determine Dimensions:** Calculate the height and width of the original shape.

3.  **Create New Grid:** Create a new grid with height = original height + 2, and width = original width + 1.

4.  **Copy Shape:** Copy the original yellow shape into the new grid, with an offset of one row down and one column to the right.

5.  **Add Frame - Top Row:** Fill the top row of the new grid with yellow, starting at column 0 (one column to the left of original shape).

6. **Add Frame - Bottom Rows**: Fill the bottom two rows with yellow.

7.  **Return:** Return the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
