Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Object:** Locate the connected component of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This forms an "L" shape.
2.  **Determine Orientation:** Analyze the "L" shape to find its orientation. Determine if the "L" is formed by removing the top-right, top-left, bottom-right, or bottom-left pixel from a 2x2 square.
3.  **Copy, Rotate, and Flip:** Create a copy of the "L" shape. Rotate the copy 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Flip the rotated image on both the x and y axis.
4. **Combine:**
    - create an output grid large enough to contain both original object and
      transformed object.
    - Place the original "L" shape in the output grid.
    - Place the flipped and rotated copy adjacent to the original "L". The exact positioning depends on the original "L" shape's orientation, so that empty space within the bounds of combined shape is minimized.
    - remove empty rows and columns

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
