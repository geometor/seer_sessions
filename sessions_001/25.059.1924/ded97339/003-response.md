Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The grids contain numerical values representing colors.
*   The primary color of interest is azure (8), with the background being white (0).
*   The azure pixels in the input appear to be sparsely distributed.
*   The azure pixels in the output form a connected shape, seemingly expanding from or related to the positions of the input azure pixels. Specifically, the output azure forms like vertical strips from any azure input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: pixels
      values: [0, 8]
    relationships:
      - input_grid:
          properties:
            azure_pixels: sparse
      - output_grid:
          properties:
            azure_pixels: connected, vertical strips

actions:
  - name: expand_azure
    description: Azure pixels in the input trigger the creation of vertical strips of azure pixels in the output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** azure pixel in the input:
    *   **Create** a vertical strip of azure pixels in the output grid.
    *   The strip **starts** at the row of the azure pixel.
    *   The strip **extends** down to the bottom.
    *   if there were any azure below, they are kept.
3.  **All other** pixels in the output grid remain white (0).

Essentially, each azure pixel in the input "casts a shadow" downwards, creating a continuous vertical azure strip in the output grid.
