```python
"""
1.  **Locate Azure Pixels:** Identify the (x, y) coordinates of all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Draw Vertical Lines:** For each azure pixel, draw a vertical line of azure pixels across the entire height of the grid. The x-coordinate of the vertical line is the same as the x-coordinate of the original azure pixel.
3.  **Draw Horizontal Lines:** For each azure pixel, draw a horizontal line of azure pixels across the entire width of the grid. The y-coordinate of the horizontal line is the same as the y-coordinate of the original azure pixel.
4. The output is a grid containing all the vertical lines and the horizontal lines.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the solution:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the core concept: propagating azure (8) color from existing azure pixels. However, it over-propagates. The original program creates *both* horizontal and vertical lines for *every* azure pixel. The examples reveal a more nuanced rule. It appears that it *only* makes vertical lines and fills the rest of the grid with white. The strategy will involve refining the propagation logic to draw vertical lines correctly and setting all other to zero.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the provided input/output/prediction triplets to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails and how propagation should occur.
2.  **Object Identification:** Use a consistent method to identify each object and color as facts in a YAML format.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program based on a more accurate understanding of the transformation rules.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where appropriate):**

Since I cannot execute code directly in this environment, I will describe the observations and the kind of metrics I would gather if I could. I will use a combination of observation descriptions and hypothetical code outputs.

*Example 1*

*   **Input:** A single azure pixel.
*   **Expected Output:** A vertical azure line through that pixel, other pixels are zero.
*   **Predicted Output:** A vertical and horizontal azure cross.
*   **Observation:** The initial algorithm correctly created the vertical line, but incorrectly also created a horizontal line.

*Example 2*

*   **Input:** Two azure pixels, vertically separated.
*   **Expected Output:** Two vertical azure lines.
*   **Predicted Output:** Two vertical azure lines *and* horizontal lines connecting the two original azure pixels and crossing.
*   **Observation:** Correct on the vertical lines, incorrect horizontal lines.

*Example 3*

*   **Input:** Three azure pixels, varying positions.
*   **Expected Output:** Three vertical azure lines.
*   **Predicted Output:** Three vertical azure lines *and* many horizontal lines corresponding to each azure pixel, crossing with the vertical lines.
*   **Observation:** Confirms the pattern: Vertical lines are correct; horizontal lines are not.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Azure Pixels:** Find the x-coordinate of all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Draw Vertical Lines:**  For each azure pixel, draw a vertical line of azure pixels across the entire height of the grid. The x-coordinate of each vertical line is the same as the x-coordinate of its corresponding azure pixel.
3. **Fill with White**: Set all other pixels in the grid to white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
