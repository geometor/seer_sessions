Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Process Each Row:** For each row in the grid:
    *   Check for Azure Pixels: Determine if the current row contains any azure pixels.
    *   If single azure pixel is found, go to next row.
    *   If any azure pixels are detected in the row: extend each group of isolated azure pixels horizontally to combine isolated pixels in the same row, forming a continuous horizontal line of azure pixels between the original pixels.
3. **Maintain all original object positions**, including original azure pixel positions.
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
