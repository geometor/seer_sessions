The output grids seem to consistently be 5x5, while input grids are larger and of consistent size within each example.  There is some complex inner structure of contiguous blocks of colors in the input and the output appears to be sampling from those colored blocks.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Each pixel is represented by a digit (0-9).\n  - observation: |\n     The output is a rectangular grid, consistently 5x5 in dimension across the supplied examples.\n  - observation: |\n      The colors in the output grid appear to be a subset of the colors present in the input grid.\n  - observation: |\n     The spatial layout of the input image is organized with regions of solid color, and there exists some organization that appears to be partitioned by the color green and the color red, with different content existing inside the partitions.\n  - observation: |\n     The output image is derived from the input image by extracting a centered detail which includes a region of solid color and parts of its border.\n  - observation: |\n      There appears to be a consistent selection mechanism for choosing which pixels from the input appear in the output, like selecting a subgrid from the input grid.\n  - action: Select a subgrid from input.\n  - relationship: Output pixels' colors match a subset of the input pixel's colors.\n\n```"
