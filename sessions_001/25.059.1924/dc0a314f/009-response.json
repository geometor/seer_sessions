The input grid appears to contain several distinct colored regions. The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from the input grid, but the spatial arrangement and size are significantly altered. It seems like a specific area of the input is selected and downsized, and perhaps some colors are filtered or ignored during the transformation.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The output only contains colors found inside of this section, ignoring color 3 (green).\n\n2.  **Define Boundaries:** The section seems to be taken from the bottom left of the green area.\n\n3.  **Extract the region.** Extract a 5x5 subgrid from the identified region of interest in the input grid. The output appears to be a cutout of part of the larger shape in the center of the input. It is a perfect square, so a good first guess will be that it is a direct cutout.\n\n4. **Output Creation**: The selected subgrid of 5x5 is then the output.\n"
