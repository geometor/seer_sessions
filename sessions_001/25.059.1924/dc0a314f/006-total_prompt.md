Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to extract a 5x5 subgrid centered around a green pixel surrounded by azure pixels. This worked perfectly for the first training example, but the other examples show this approach is too specific. The core concept of extracting a subgrid is valid, but the method of identifying the subgrid's center needs to be generalized. The other examples show different configurations and different surrounding colors. The second example appears to follow the rule but with a black surround. The third example is a different size.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze the Results:** Carefully examine each input/output/predicted output triplet. Identify where the prediction deviates from the expected output.
2.  **Generalize the Center-Finding Logic:** Instead of hardcoding the green/azure pattern, we need a more flexible rule. This might involve looking for:
    *   The *smallest* enclosing rectangle of a particular object.
    *    Objects, shapes or configurations that repeat in each example.
3.  **Size of the output:**  In the third example, the output is 3x3 rather than 5x5. We should investigate the sizes of objects to better understand how to derive a more general rule.
4. **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic on all training examples after each modification.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for precise reports):**

def analyze_results(examples, transform_function):
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = example["input"]
        expected_output = example["output"]
        predicted_output = transform_function(input_grid)
        
        # Convert to numpy arrays for easier comparison
        expected_output_np = np.array(expected_output) if expected_output is not None else None
        predicted_output_np = np.array(predicted_output) if predicted_output is not None else None

        # Check if prediction matches expected output
        match = np.array_equal(expected_output_np, predicted_output_np)
        
        results.append({
            "example_index": i,
            "input_shape": np.array(input_grid).shape,

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** In each input grid, find the smallest rectangular region that encloses all pixels of a single color that forms the innermost object.
2.  **Determine the Output Size:** The output size seems linked to the target object size.  If target object size is WxH, output grid size is WxH.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid that corresponds to the bounding box found in step 1.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
