      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 5x5
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - colors:
      type: set
      elements: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8} # Colors present in both input and output

actions:
  - extraction:
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid
      description: A sub-region of the input grid is selected and becomes the output grid.

relationships:
   - output_is_subregion_of_input: True
   - color_consistency:  The output grid contains only colors that were also in a corresponding location of the input grid.
