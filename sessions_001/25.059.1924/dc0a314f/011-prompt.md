Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify the Region of Interest:** Locate the large central region of primarily orange (7) and red (2) pixels. The output only contains colors found inside of this section, ignoring color 3 (green).
2. **Define Boundaries:** The section seems to be taken from the bottom left of the green area.
3. **Extract the region.** Extract a 5x5 subgrid from the identified region of interest in the input grid. The output appears to be a cutout of part of the larger shape in the center of the input. It is a perfect square, so a good first guess will be that it is a direct cutout.
4. **Output Creation**: The selected subgrid of 5x5 is then the output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
