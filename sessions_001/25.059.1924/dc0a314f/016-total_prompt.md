Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 16x16 grid, and the output is a 5x5 grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid seems to be a highly compressed and abstracted representation of the input grid. There's a noticeable reduction in size and a loss of detail. Many colors present in the input (blue, green, yellow, magenta, azure, orange) are absent in the output. The output predominantly features gray, maroon, and red, with one instance of magenta. It appears that some kind of "selection" and maybe "averaging" are performed on the input grid based on the position of some of the pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    size: 16x16
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    size: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: significant size reduction from input to output
  - observation: output colors are a subset of input colors
  - observation: Spatial relationships in the input are somewhat preserved, but greatly simplified, in the output.
  - action: selection
    description: Specific pixels or regions from the input are chosen.
  - action: compression
    description: input is transformed into a much small output
  - relationship: output_grid is a compressed_representation of input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Conceptually divide the 16x16 input grid into non-overlapping sub-grids. Since the output is 5x5, we need to identify a strategy to select a subset of these for the final result.
2.  **Select:** Instead of simply subdividing, it seems to be a process of selecting some pixels as a representation of the region. The pattern of selection looks like:
     - start from top-left: select 3x2 block
     - skip a number of rows and column. This number can be variable. Select another block and so on.
3. The size of blocks being selected does not appear uniform.
4.  **Output:** Construct the 5x5 output grid with the selected colors/pixels.

It appears that there is more of an "extraction" of certain colored blocks rather than creating subgrids and processing them.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
