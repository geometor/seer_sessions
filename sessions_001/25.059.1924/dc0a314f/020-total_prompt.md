```python
"""
The transformation extracts specific colored pixels from the input grid to create a smaller output grid. The selection is based on a pattern that starts from the top-left and moves across the grid, selecting non-uniform sized sub-blocks, and is likely influenced by the color of the pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example and makes a significant assumption about fixed offsets for selecting pixels. The results from running this code on other training examples reveal that this assumption is incorrect. The pattern is not simply based on constant row and column offsets. The output grid size also seems to vary, not a fixed 5x5.

My strategy to address this is as follows:

1.  **Analyze all examples**: Examine *all* input/output pairs, including those the initial code failed on.
2.  **Object Identification**: Use `get_objects` to identify contiguous regions of the same color within each input grid. My hypothesis is still around objects, but needs more sophistication.
3.  **Pattern Recognition**: Instead of fixed offsets, I need to discern a more dynamic rule. It might involve:
    *   The colors of the objects.
    *   The spatial relationships between objects (adjacency, relative position).
    *   Possibly a combination of object properties and a more complex selection rule.
4.  **Variable Output Size**: Determine how the output grid size is determined. It likely depends on some characteristic of the input.
5.  **Iterative Refinement**: Start with a simple rule, test it against all examples, identify discrepancies, and refine the rule.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

I need to gather detailed information about the examples. I will augment the python code to include detailed logging, including:

*   Input and Output grids.
*   Objects found in the input grid.
*   The result of `transform(input_grid)`.
*   A comparison between the `transform` result and the expected output.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of the same color in the input grid.
2.  **Select Object:**  If there is exactly one object in the grid, select it.
3.  **Copy Object:** Create a new grid with dimensions 5x5. Copy the selected object into the new grid, preserving its shape and color. The position of the copied object in the output grid matches the column of the object in the input grid. The object is placed starting at the top row of the output.

The key insight here is that the transformation identifies and *copies* a *single* vertical line object from the input to the output, maintaining its shape, color and column position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
