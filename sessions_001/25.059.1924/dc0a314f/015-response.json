Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid seems to be a highly compressed and abstracted representation of the input grid. There's a noticeable reduction in size and a loss of detail. Many colors present in the input (blue, green, yellow, magenta, azure, orange) are absent in the output. The output predominantly features gray, maroon, and red, with one instance of magenta. It appears that some kind of \"selection\" and maybe \"averaging\" are performed on the input grid based on the position of some of the pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Since the output is 5x5, we need to identify a strategy to select a subset of these for the final result.\n2.  **Select:** Instead of simply subdividing, it seems to be a process of selecting some pixels as a representation of the region. The pattern of selection looks like:\n     - start from top-left: select 3x2 block\n     - skip a number of rows and column. This number can be variable. Select another block and so on.\n3. The size of blocks being selected does not appear uniform.\n4.  **Output:** Construct the 5x5 output grid with the selected colors/pixels.\n\nIt appears that there is more of an \"extraction\" of certain colored blocks rather than creating subgrids and processing them.\n"
