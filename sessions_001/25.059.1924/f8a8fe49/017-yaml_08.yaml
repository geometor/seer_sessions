objects:
  - color: red (2)
    shape: rectangle
    description: A solid rectangular block of red pixels.  May be different sizes and aspect ratios.
    behavior: Stationary. Serves as a reference object.
  - color: gray (5)
    shape: single pixel
    description: One or more single gray pixels.
    behavior: Moves to a position adjacent to the red object, favoring positions that "fill in" corners of the red object outline.

actions:
  - name: move_gray_pixels
    agent: gray pixels
    target: positions adjacent to red object
    constraints:
      - "Move to a position such that if the grey pixel were red, it extends one of the lines of red pixels."
      - If multiple target positions are available, prefer ones where there are empty adjancent pixels that would form a 'corner'.
      - Do not move off the grid.
