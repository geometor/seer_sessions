The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and gray (5).  The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid. The most notable change is the repositioning of the gray (5) pixels. They seem to have moved, while the red (2) pixels and white(0) pixels seem to maintain their relative positions. The gray pixels in output are all at the border or corner of red shape.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Also they can only be at corner positions of the whole grid.\n    *   Move the gray pixels to these locations.\n\n3. **Preservation:** Keep the red object on the same position.\n"
