There are two primary colors present: red (2) and gray (5). The red pixels form two vertical lines, like pillars, and two horizontal lines connecting them at the top and bottom, resembling a closed rectangular shape or a stylized \"H\".  The gray pixels appear to be inside this \"H\" shape, arranged in two vertical groups. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement or movement of the gray pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This forms the boundaries for the transformation.\n2.  **Locate gray:** Identify the two groups of gray pixels inside.\n3. **Mirror:** The gray pixels are mirrored over the vertical axis of symmetry within the red shape.\n4.  **Move and combine Gray Pixels:** all gray pixels move to the outside of the red stucture. Pixels on left side move to the left, and pixels on right side move to the right. Gray pixels create a single vertical line of four pixels high on each outside of the red lines.\n\nEssentially, the gray pixels inside the \"H\" are mirrored/reflected to new vertical line positions along outer edges of the left and right \"pillars\" of the red shape.\n"
