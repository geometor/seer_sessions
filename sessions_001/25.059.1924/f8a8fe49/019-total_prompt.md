Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of red (2) pixels and all individual gray (5) pixels. Treat background (0) pixels as empty space.

2.  **Find Red Object Outline:** Determine the outline of the red object(s). The outline consists of all positions adjacent to the red object(s) where a gray pixel could potentially be placed.

3.  **Gray Pixel Relocation:** For each gray pixel:
    *   Find the closest outline position to that gray pixel (Manhattan distance).
    *   Move the gray pixel to the available outline position. If there are multiple valid choices of outline positions, consider the adjacent pixels. Select the position where the adjacent pixels form a corner.
    * Ensure the gray pixel stays within the original grid boundaries.

4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the red object(s) in their original positions and the gray pixels relocated as described above.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
