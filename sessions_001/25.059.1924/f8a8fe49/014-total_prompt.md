Transformation Rule:

1.  **Identify Red Structures:** Locate contiguous areas of red pixels. These form the reference structures.
2.  **Identify Gray Pixels and their Relation to Red Structures:** Find all gray pixels. Determine if these gray pixels are located *between* two "mostly vertical" sections of the red structure.
3. **Reposition Gray Pixels:**
    *   Gray pixels that are found between nearly verticle red structure sections are moved.
    *   The gray pixels that are moved are repositioned one column to the left of the left red section and one column to the right of the right red section.
    * The moved gray pixels form vertical lines adjacent to and outside of the red structure's almost vertical bars. The height of these vertical lines is equal to the number of gray pixels that are between vertical bars in the original input.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code captured the core idea of the transformation: identifying red structures, finding gray pixels between vertical sections of these structures, and repositioning those gray pixels. However, the execution on the full training set reveals some shortcomings, particularly in handling cases where the number of gray rows to create on either side of the "C" is greater than the bounding box height.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
1.  **Bounding Box definition** Improve the definition of the bounding
    box. Currently, there is an attempt, but it needs to be more robust,
    especially in edge and corner cases.
2.  **Height constraint**. If the number of gray pixels to be added as height is
    greater than the bounding box height, it must be constrained.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand the failures, let's analyze each example and its outcome:

*   **Example 1:** (Correct) Input shape (13, 13). The code correctly identified the red "C" shape, the gray pixels inside it, and moved them to the outside.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect) Input shape (11, 13). It seems like all gray pixels, regardless of their position relative to the red structure, were moved.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect) Input shape (13, 25). It appears that additional rows were added and the left vertical portion of red pixels was incorrectly detected.

**Code Execution for Metrics:**
```python
def analyze_results(task):
    results = []
    for i, (train_input, train_output) in enumerate(task['train']):
        input_grid = np.array(train_input['input'])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(train_output['output'])
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
        is_correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output_grid, expected_output_grid)
        results.append({
            'example': i + 1,
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': expected_output_grid.shape,
            'predicted_shape': predicted_output_grid.shape,
            'correct': is_correct
        })

        if not is_correct:
          print(f"Example {i+1} errors:")
          diff = predicted_output_grid - expected_output_grid
          print(np.argwhere(diff != 0))

    return results
import json
task = json.load(open('272f9755.json'))
analysis = analyze_results(task)
for item in analysis:
  print(item)
```

**Example Analysis Continued**

    ```
    {'example': 1, 'input_shape': (13, 13), 'output_shape': (13, 13), 'predicted_shape': (13, 13), 'correct': True}
    ```

    ```
    {'example': 2, 'input_shape': (11, 13), 'output_shape': (11, 13), 'predicted_shape': (11, 13), 'correct': False}
    Example 2 errors:
    [[ 2  3]
     [ 2 11]
     [ 3  3]

     [ 8  3]
     [ 8 11]]
    ```

    ```
    {'example': 3, 'input_shape': (13, 25), 'output_shape': (13, 25), 'predicted_shape': (13, 25), 'correct': False}
    Example 3 errors:
    [[ 1  1]

     [10 23]]
    ```
**YAML Facts:**

      shape: C-like

    condition: number of gray pixels exceeds bounding box height
    action: limit height to bounding box height
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Structure:** Locate the contiguous region of red pixels, which forms a "C"-like shape.
2.  **Define Bounding Box:** Define a rectangular bounding box that encompasses the entire red structure.
3.  **Identify Vertical Sections:** Within the red structure, identify the leftmost and rightmost vertical "bars".
4.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Find all gray pixels.
5.  **Determine Gray Pixel Location:** Determine which gray pixels are located *between* the vertical bars of the red structure, considering only the rows within the vertical extent of both bars.
6.  **Reposition Gray Pixels:**
    *   The gray pixels located between the vertical bars are moved.
    *   Create two new vertical lines of gray pixels: one immediately to the left of the left red bar and one immediately to the right of the right red bar.
    *   The *number* of gray pixels in each new vertical line is equal to the number of gray pixels that were originally between the vertical bars, with a maximum height defined next.
    *   The height of the new gray pixel lines should not exceed the height of the bounding box of the red structure. The top of the gray lines align with the top of the bounding box.

This revised natural language program should provide a much more accurate and complete description, addressing the issues encountered during testing.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
