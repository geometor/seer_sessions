Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids of colored pixels into output grids. The most obvious changes are:

1.  **Color Reduction:** The output grids seem to retain only a subset of the colors present in the input grids.
2.  **Column Focus:** It appears the transformation extracts a specific column from the input grid and uses it to form the output grid. Non-selected colors become white (0).
3.  **Consistent Column:** The same column index appears to be selected in all examples.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: Output grids retain only a subset of colors from the input grids.
  - observation: All non-zero pixels in the output are in a single column.
  - observation: The position of the non-zero pixels within the selected output column corresponds to their row in the input.
  - hypothesis: A specific column is selected from the input to create the output.
  - hypothesis: The values in the selected column are preserved, while all other values are set to 0 (white).
  - hypothesis: The selected column's index is consistent across all examples.
  - property: input_grid: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - property: output_grid: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - action: select_column: Selects a single column from the input grid.
  - action: filter_colors: Replaces non-selected colors with 0.
  - relationship: column_index: The index of the column to select (constant).
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Column:** Determine the index of the column to be extracted. Based on visual inspection, it looks like the third column (index 2) is consistently selected.
2.  **Copy Column:** Copy the values from the target column of the input grid to the corresponding column in the output grid.
3.  **Clear Other Columns:** Set all other pixel values in the output grid to 0 (white).

In essence, the transformation is a column extraction and filtering operation. The rule appears to be: "Extract the third column (index 2) from the input grid and set all other values in the output grid to 0."
