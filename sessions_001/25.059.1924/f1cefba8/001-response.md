Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The tasks involve 2D grids containing colored pixels. The colors represent different objects or parts of objects. There's a clear geometric and topological aspect, with shapes (rectangles) and their interior/exterior relationships being important. The transformation seems to involve inverting, adding and potentially rotating certain colored regions within the grid. Color changes and additions of background elements are also significant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
      - name: outer_rectangle
        properties:
          - shape: rectangle
          - attributes: filled, color_variable
      - name: inner_rectangle
        properties:
          - shape: rectangle
          - attributes: filled, color_variable, inside outer_rectangle
      - name: background
        properties:
            - shape: grid
            - attributes: fills_remaining_space, color_mostly_black

  - actions:
      - name: invert_inner
        description: Change color of some pixels within the inner rectangle.
      - name: add_background_elements
        description: add vertical and horizontal color stripes across the grid, inverting existing pixels on the inner rectangle edge
      - name: modify_background
        description: change colors of the background around the rectangles

  - relationships:
      - type: containment
        from: outer_rectangle
        to: inner_rectangle
      - type: spatial
        description: inner rectangle is centered within the outer rectangle.
      - type: color_inversion
        description: Colors of inner rectangle edges pixels are inverted.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the outer and inner rectangles based on their colors and contiguous shapes. The background consists of black pixels.
2.  **Process Inner Rectangle:**
    *   Identify the inner rectangle's color.
    *   Invert color of pixels in the edges of the inner rectangle (change green to red, blue to yellow, red to green, yellow to blue).
3.  **Add Background Elements:**
    *   Extend vertical and horizontal lines from the inner rectangle's edges, crossing the entire grid, inverting colors of every inner rectangle's pixel on the edges.
4. **Modify Background**
    *   Change original background pixels (originally black) to the inverted colors of the elements added in the previous step, according to the lines position.

The core concept is an "inversion" of pixels on the edges of the inner rectangle and the addition of inverted lines coming out of the inner rectangle and covering all the grid, including making changes on the original background.
