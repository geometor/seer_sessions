The primary colors involved are red (2), green (3), and black (0). The input appears to be a large, mostly red object with an inner green object, both roughly rectangular. The output seems to be a modified version of the input, with some alterations to the green object and the addition of single black pixels in the corners.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
