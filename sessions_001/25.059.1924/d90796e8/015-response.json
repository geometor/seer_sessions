The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The input grid transforms into the output grid, with some pixels changing their color while others remain the same. The key difference appears to be the replacement of some colored pixels (red and green specifically) with azure (8) pixels. The gray (5) and white(0) pixels stay.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
