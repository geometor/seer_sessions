Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The input grid transforms into the output grid, with some pixels changing their color while others remain the same. The key difference appears to be the replacement of some colored pixels (red and green specifically) with azure (8) pixels. The gray (5) and white(0) pixels stay.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: 7
      - columns: 7
      - cells:
          type: pixel
          properties:
            - color: integer (0-9)
            - position: (row, column)

  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - color: green(3)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    parameters:
      - old_color: [red(2), green(3)]
      - new_color: azure(8)
    conditions:
        - adjacent to each other, red is on the left side of green

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Pixels can be adjacent horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all red (2) and green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   Check neighbors, the red(2) and green(3) should be adjacent. Red is on the left side of the Green.
    *   If a red(2) and green(3) pixels satisfy above condition, change to the color azure (8).
3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels that are not red or green, or do not meet condition in step 2, remain unchanged.
4  **Output:** the result after step 2 and 3.

In simpler term: Find adjacent red and green pixels, replace it with azure, while keeping all other colors unchanged.
