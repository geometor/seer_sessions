Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified a simple color swap: green to azure, and red to white. However, the additional training examples reveal that this is *not* the complete rule. It seems the rule is context-specific, perhaps only applying to certain shapes or objects.  The code works perfectly on example 0 but fails on examples 1, 2, and 3.  This strongly suggests that the color transformation is conditional on something more than just the initial color. We need to consider the *shapes* or spatial relationships of the colored pixels.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** We need to move beyond simple pixel-by-pixel analysis and start identifying "objects" within the grids.  An object, for our purposes, is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Contextual Rule Discovery:**  We'll look at each example, and for *each object*, determine whether the color transformation rule applies.  We'll examine the properties of the objects (e.g., shape, size, neighbors) to see what differentiates objects that are transformed from those that are not.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the contextual rules, we will rewrite the natural language program to reflect the object-based, conditional transformations.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution for illustration):**

I will describe what code execution *would* show, since I cannot actually execute code here. I will use example indices according to the order in the prompt, staring with zero.

*   **Example 0:**
    *   Input: Contains green and red regions, as well as gray and white.
    *   Expected Output: Green becomes azure, red becomes white.
    *   Actual Output: Green becomes azure, red becomes white.
    *   Result: **Success**. The simple rule holds.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A more complex arrangement of colored shapes. One red square and multiple green shapes.
    *   Expected Output: Shows that only *some* red and green areas change, specifically only the smalles square/rectangle of green and red.
    *   Actual Output (from previous code): *All* red changes to white, *all* green changes to azure.
    *   Result: **Failure**. The simple rule is incorrect here. The transformation must be restricted by size of color region.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Small red and green squares.
    *   Expected Output: Red becomes white, green becomes azure.
    *   Actual Output: Red becomes white, green becomes azure.
    *   Result: **Failure**. If restricted by the smallest area, it still succeeds.
* **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Small red and green squares.
    *   Expected Output: Red becomes white, green becomes azure.
    *   Actual Output: Red becomes white, green becomes azure.
    *   Result: **Failure**. If restricted by the smallest area, it still succeeds.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all 1x1 regions (single pixels) of color green (3).
2.  Change the color of these identified green pixels to azure (8).
3.  Identify all 1x1 regions (single pixels) that are the color red (2).
4.  Change the color of the identified red pixels to white (0).
5.  Preserve all other pixels in their original state and positions.

Essentially, the refined rule is "If a contiguous region of color is exactly 1x1 and is green, change it to azure. If a contiguous region of color is exactly 1x1 and red, change it to white. Otherwise, leave the pixel unchanged." This differs from the original by focusing on *1x1* regions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
