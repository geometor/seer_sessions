The input grid contains three non-zero values: 3 (green), 2 (red), and 5 (gray).  The output grid also has the same dimensions, but only two non-zero values: 8 (azure) and 5 (gray). The 5 (gray) is in the same location in both grids. The 3 (green) and 2 (red) in the top row of the input grid have been replaced by an 8 (azure) in the output grid.  The positions of the zero-valued cells (white) remain constant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
