Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, focusing on object perception, relationships, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The core structure is a 12x12 grid.
*   **Colors:**  Multiple colors are present, represented by digits 0-9 (white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon).
*   **Objects:** We can consider contiguous blocks of the same color as objects.
*    Border: The input grid has blue(1), orange (7) and white(0) on its border.
*   **Background:** The majority of the grid is filled with a background color (0, white).
* **Specific Colors/Shapes:** There are seemingly random placements of other colors within the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [12, 12]
    border:
      top: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]
      bottom: [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
      left: [0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]
      right: [0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0]
    elements:
      - color: 0  # White
        type: background
      - color: 1  # Blue
        positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [0,4], [0,5],[0,6], [0,7], [0,8],[0,9], [0, 10]]
      - color: 2 #red
        positions: [[1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [4,0], [5,0],[6,0], [7,0], [8,0],[9,0], [10, 0]]
      - color: 3 #green
        positions: [[4,4]]
      - color: 4 # Yellow
        positions: [[1,11], [2,11], [3,11], [4,11], [5,11],[6,11], [7,11], [8,11],[9,11], [10, 11]]
      - color: 7 #orange
        positions: [[11,1], [11,2], [11,3], [11,4], [11,5],[11,6], [11,7], [11,8],[11,9], [11, 10], [2,9], [9,8]]
      - color: 8 #azure
        positions: [[8,3]]
      - color: 1 #Blue
        positions: [[9,5]]

actions:
  - type: move
    description: "Certain colored pixels are moved within the grid."

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Objects/pixels have positions relative to each other and the grid boundaries."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Find all pixels not equal to 0, except the pixels on the borders.
2.  **Check for color changes**:
    * Blue(1) at (9,5) changes to white(0)
    * Orange(7) at (2,9) changes to white(0)
    * Azure (8) at (8,3) change to White (0)
    * Green(3) at (4,4) changes to white(0)
3.  **Recreate Pixels:**
    * Create a Red(2) at (3,1).
    * Create an Orange(7) at (10,8).
    * Create an Orange(7) at (10,9).
4. Keep the border.

In summary the input grid colored pixels that were not a part of the border got almost entirely erased, and only a few were created. A red(2) pixel close to the left border, and two orange pixels close to the bottom right corner.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
