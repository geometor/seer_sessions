Previous Code:
```python
"""
Preserve the top (magenta) and bottom (green) horizontal bands, and the left (yellow) and right (azure) vertical bands.
Within the inner region:
1. Change the yellow(4) pixel in the 4th row and 9th column to magenta (6).
2. Remove the red (2) pixel.
3. Remove the single magenta(6) pixel that was originally in the 4th row and 9th column.
4. Keep all other isolated azure(8) and yellow(4) pixels within the center.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on observations from the *first* training example only. This is insufficient, as ARC tasks often involve rules that generalize across *all* examples. The code correctly handles the first example but fails on others, indicating that the transformation rule is incomplete and needs to be revised to incorporate patterns observed across all training pairs. The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine the input and output grids of *all* training examples.
2.  **Identify common patterns:** Determine consistent transformations that apply across *all* examples, not just the first.
3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the description to accurately reflect the generalized transformation rule.
4. **Focus on the border:** The current instruction correctly identifies a pattern of preservation in the border, this should be a constant in the program and other features should be considered based on their relationship to the border.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations**

I will now provide the code for preparing the observations.

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(task):
    results = []
    # create the transform function and required helper functions

    def find_pixel(grid, color, row_start, row_end, col_start, col_end):
        # find a specific pixel in a subgrid
        for r in range(row_start, row_end):
            for c in range(col_start, col_end):
                if grid[r,c] == color:
                    return (r,c)
        return None

    def transform(input_grid):
        # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
        output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
        rows, cols = input_grid.shape

        # Change yellow to magenta
        output_grid[3,8] = 6 # since array indexing starts at 0

        # Remove the red (2) pixel.  It's located at (2,2)
        output_grid[2,2] = 0
        
        # Remove the magenta(6) pixel, now in the 9th column and 4th row
        #output_grid[3, 8] = 0 # it used to be here, so don't do this


        return output_grid

    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output = transform(input_grid.copy())  # Use a copy to avoid modifying the original input.

        # Basic metrics:
        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output, output_grid)
        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The top and bottom rows, and the leftmost and rightmost columns, are preserved in all examples."
  - object_1:
      type: "Horizontal Band"
      color: "Magenta (6)"
      location: "Top row"
      action: "Preserved"
  - object_2:
      type: "Horizontal Band"
      color: "Green (3)"
      location: "Bottom row"
      action: "Preserved"
  - object_3:
     type: "Vertical Band"
     color: "Yellow (4)"
     location: "left column"
     action: "Preserved"
  - object_4:
     type: "Vertical Band"
     color: "Azure (8)"
     location: "Right column"
     action: "Preserved"
  - observation: "All pixels inside of the preserved bands are set to black (0)"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Preserve Borders:** Keep the top and bottom horizontal bands, and the leftmost and rightmost vertical bands, unchanged.
2. **Clear Interior:** Set all pixels located *within* the inner region (i.e., not part of the preserved borders) to black (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
