Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Double the Grid:** The output grid is created by doubling the dimensions of the input grid.

2. **Replicate White Pixels:** For each white (0) pixel in the input grid, a 2x2 block of white pixels is placed in the corresponding position in the output grid. For example an input white pixel at (r,c) will create output white pixels at:
    *   (2r, 2c)
    *   (2r+1, 2c)
    *   (2r, 2c+1)
    *   (2r+1, 2c+1)

3. **Transform and Replicate Yellow Pixels:** For each yellow (4) pixel in the input grid:
    *   A yellow pixel (4) is placed in the output grid, at the "top-left" cell of the corresponding 2x2 block (coordinate 2*row, 2*col).
    *   Azure (8) pixels are placed adjacent to the new yellow pixel within the 2x2 block. Adjacent means up, down, left, right. So coordinates:
        *   (2r+1, 2c)
        *   (2r, 2c+1)
        *   (2r+1, 2c+1)

4. **Generalization:** This rule applied to any size input.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
