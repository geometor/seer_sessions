import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_rows, output_cols = input_rows * 2, input_cols * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)
    
    # fill new grid with 8
    output_grid[:] = 8

    # replace the original colors in the expanded grid, keeping the relative position
    for r in range(input_rows):
        for c in range(input_cols):
            output_grid[r*2, c*2] = input_grid[r,c]


    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example. While it correctly identified the expansion and color replacement aspects, it failed to generalize to all training examples. Specifically, the initial attempt assumed a simple doubling of the grid size and direct color mapping. The provided results now include evaluations against all the training set, showing the program works for the first example, fails on the second example, and has a mixed result on the third.

The core issue is that the transformation isn't a simple doubling, but more complex. There is an added white border which means the code is missing a critical piece of instruction from the program description. Also, the color and size are not handled appropriately on the additional examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each input/output pair and the corresponding code execution results. Pay close attention to discrepancies.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Determine the *actual* expansion rule, how colors map, and the general rule for adding the white border.
3.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation rules.
4.  **Prepare for Coding:** Provide a clear, step-by-step natural language program that accounts for all observed behaviors.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

```python
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    shape = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    return f"Shape: {shape}, Unique Colors: {unique_colors}"

# Example Data (assuming this is available in a structured format)
examples = [
  {
        "input": np.array([[5]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 8, 8, 0],
       [0, 8, 5, 8, 0],
       [0, 8, 8, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[5, 5], [5, 5]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
       [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],
       [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
       [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],
       [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    },
   {
        "input": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),
        "output": np.array( [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],
        [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    }
]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    input_desc = describe_grid(example['input'])
    output_desc = describe_grid(example['output'])
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input: {input_desc}")
    print(f"  Output: {output_desc}")
```

**Example 1:**
  Input: Shape: (1, 1), Unique Colors: [5]
  Output: Shape: (5, 5), Unique Colors: [0 5 8]
**Example 2:**
  Input: Shape: (2, 2), Unique Colors: [5]
  Output: Shape: (7, 7), Unique Colors: [0 5 8]
**Example 3:**
  Input: Shape: (3, 3), Unique Colors: [5]
  Output: Shape: (9, 9), Unique Colors: [0 5 8]

From this we deduce:

*   The output grid dimensions are always 2\*input + 3, and the function does not have a hardcoded size.
*   The function adds a border.
* The original pixel's positions are located at every other row/col in the new array.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      shape: variable, ranging from 1x1 to 3x3 in the examples
      colors: contains only color 5 (gray) in the examples
      type: 2D array

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      shape: derived from input_grid shape; output_shape = (2 * input_shape) + 3
      colors: contains colors 0 (white), 5 (gray), and 8 (light blue)
      type: 2D array
    relations:
      - to: input_grid
        type: expansion
        details: Each dimension expands to 2 * original_dimension + 3

  - object: transformation_rule
    properties:
       color_mapping:  input color 5 (gray) is preserved; other cells use background of color 8, white border
       border: white border
       expansion: see output grid shape
    actions:
      - type: expand
        details: Grid expands by rule output_shape = (2*input_shape) + 3
      - type: color_fill
        details: Original input pixels are placed in the expanded grid, surrounded by light blue (8), and with white (0) border.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** Take the input grid and expand its dimensions. The output grid's dimensions are calculated as follows: `output_dimension = (2 * input_dimension) + 3`. For instance, if the input is 1x1, the output is 5x5. If the input is 2x2, the output is 7x7, and so on.
2.  **Border:** Add a border of white pixels (color 0) around the entire output grid.
3.  **Background:** Fill the remaining cells, except the locations that contain the original image, with the background color azure (color 8).
4.  **Original Pixel Placement:** Place the original input grid's pixels into the output grid.  The original pixels will be located at every other cell, starting at index \[2, 2] (row 2, column 2) of the *output grid*. The original image pixels retain their original color (5/gray, in this case). Specifically, original pixel at \[r, c] in the input goes to \[2\*r + 2, 2\*c + 2] in the output.

This refined natural language program gives clear instructions, and will guide the code generation better, handling all the observed test cases.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
