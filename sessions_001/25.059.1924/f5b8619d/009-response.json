There are three '5' (gray) pixels. Two '5's are at opposite corners, and one is in the top row.\n*   **Output:** A 12x12 grid. It seems to be an expansion of the input grid. The '5' (gray) pixels from the input are present in the output, in the same relative positions, but with a 1 empty white cell border. '8' (light blue) appears to surround every existing pixel, including the '5' and the '0', it seems like an expansion of the existing grid, with extra border on the sides.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
