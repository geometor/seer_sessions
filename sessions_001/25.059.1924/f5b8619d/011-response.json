            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example. While it correctly identified the expansion and color replacement aspects, it failed to generalize to all training examples. Specifically, the initial attempt assumed a simple doubling of the grid size and direct color mapping. The provided results now include evaluations against all the training set, showing the program works for the first example, fails on the second example, and has a mixed result on the third.\n\nThe core issue is that the transformation isn't a simple doubling, but more complex. There is an added white border which means the code is missing a critical piece of instruction from the program description. Also, the color and size are not handled appropriately on the additional examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each input/output pair and the corresponding code execution results. Pay close attention to discrepancies.\n2.  **Identify Patterns:** Determine the *actual* expansion rule, how colors map, and the general rule for adding the white border.\n3.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the observed transformation rules.\n4.  **Prepare for Coding:** Provide a clear, step-by-step natural language program that accounts for all observed behaviors.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    shape = grid.shape\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)\n    return f\"Shape: {shape}, Unique Colors: {unique_colors}\"\n\n# Example Data (assuming this is available in a structured format)\nexamples = [\n  {\n        \"input\": np.array([[5]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n       [0, 8, 5, 8, 0],\n       [0, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([[5, 5], [5, 5]]),\n        \"output\": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n       [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],\n       [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n       [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],\n       [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n       [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n    },\n   {\n        \"input\": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),\n        \"output\": np.array( [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],\n        [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],\n        [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 0],\n        [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n    }\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n    input_desc = describe_grid(example['input'])\n    output_desc = describe_grid(example['output'])\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(f\"  Input: {input_desc}\")\n    print(f\"  Output: {output_desc}\")\n```\n\n**Example 1:**\n  Input: Shape: (1, 1), Unique Colors: [5]\n  Output: Shape: (5, 5), Unique Colors: [0 5 8]\n**Example 2:**\n  Input: Shape: (2, 2), Unique Colors: [5]\n  Output: Shape: (7, 7), Unique Colors: [0 5 8]\n**Example 3:**\n  Input: Shape: (3, 3), Unique Colors: [5]\n  Output: Shape: (9, 9), Unique Colors: [0 5 8]\n\nFrom this we deduce:\n\n*   The output grid dimensions are always 2\\*input + 3, and the function does not have a hardcoded size.\n*   The function adds a border.\n* The original pixel's positions are located at every other row/col in the new array.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      shape: variable, ranging from 1x1 to 3x3 in the examples\n      colors: contains only color 5 (gray) in the examples\n      type: 2D array\n\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      shape: derived from input_grid shape; output_shape = (2 * input_shape) + 3\n      colors: contains colors 0 (white), 5 (gray), and 8 (light blue)\n      type: 2D array\n    relations:\n      - to: input_grid\n        type: expansion\n        details: Each dimension expands to 2 * original_dimension + 3\n\n  - object: transformation_rule\n    properties:\n       color_mapping:  input color 5 (gray) is preserved; other cells use background of color 8, white border\n       border: white border\n       expansion: see output grid shape\n    actions:\n      - type: expand\n        details: Grid expands by rule output_shape = (2*input_shape) + 3\n      - type: color_fill\n        details: Original input pixels are placed in the expanded grid, surrounded by light blue (8), and with white (0) border.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Expansion:** Take the input grid and expand its dimensions. The output grid's dimensions are calculated as follows: `output_dimension = (2 * input_dimension) + 3`. For instance, if the input is 1x1, the output is 5x5. If the input is 2x2, the output is 7x7, and so on.\n2.  **Border:** Add a border of white pixels (color 0) around the entire output grid.\n3.  **Background:** Fill the remaining cells, except the locations that contain the original image, with the background color azure (color 8).\n4.  **Original Pixel Placement:** Place the original input grid's pixels into the output grid.  The original pixels will be located at every other cell, starting at index \\[2, 2] (row 2, column 2) of the *output grid*. The original image pixels retain their original color (5/gray, in this case). Specifically, original pixel at \\[r, c] in the input goes to \\[2\\*r + 2, 2\\*c + 2] in the output.\n\nThis refined natural language program gives clear instructions, and will guide the code generation better, handling all the observed test cases.\n"
