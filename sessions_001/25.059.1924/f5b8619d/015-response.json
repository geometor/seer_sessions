The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and yellow (4).  The output grid introduces a new color, azure (8), and expands the original grid. The arrangement of the original colors seems to be preserved and replicated within the larger output grid, suggesting a pattern of duplication and possibly some form of arithmetic operation or color substitution.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

For example, a white pixel at (0,0) in input becomes white pixels at (0,0), (0,2),(2,0), and(2,2) in output.\n    *    For each yellow (4) pixel in the input grid:\n         * Place a yellow pixel (4) in same location in output grid.\n         * Place a new color, azure (8) in the horizontally, vertically and diagonally adjacent pixel in output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation expands the grid and replicates the original pattern, with the yellow pixels spawning, in their new location, a horizontally and vertically adjacent azure pixel.\n"
