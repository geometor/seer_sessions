Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 6x6 grid. Most cells are '0' (white). There are three '5' (gray) pixels. Two '5's are at opposite corners, and one is in the top row.
*   **Output:** A 12x12 grid. It seems to be an expansion of the input grid. The '5' (gray) pixels from the input are present in the output, in the same relative positions, but with a 1 empty white cell border. '8' (light blue) appears to surround every existing pixel, including the '5' and the '0', it seems like an expansion of the existing grid, with extra border on the sides.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      input_shape: [6, 6]
      output_shape: [12, 12]
      input_colors: [0, 5]
      output_colors: [0, 5, 8]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color_0: white
      color_5: gray
      color_8: azure

actions:
    - name: expand_grid
      description: The input grid is expanded, and a new azure border surrounds the original colors and add an extra row/column

    - name: maintain_relative_positions
      description: The '5' pixels maintain relative positions within the expanded grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand the Grid:** Take each pixel on input, surround it with light blue (8) pixels.

2.  **Preserve Positions:** the gray (5) pixels from the input maintain the relative positions.

3. **Add a border**: Add an extra rows/columns on the sides.

In summary, the transformation expands the original image by surrounding each original pixel with light blue and preserving the position of the original gray.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
