objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x11
      cells: pixels
      colors: [0, 2, 5, 8, 6]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
       color: integer (0-9)
       position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: color_substitution
    description: Certain colors in the input are replaced by other colors in the output.
  - name: color_influence
    description: Some colors seem to influence neighboring pixels, potentially causing color changes.
  - name: color_shifting
    description: locations of some colors shift

observations:
  - input_colors: [0, 2, 5, 8, 6]
  - output_colors: [0, 2, 8, 6]
  - color_5_disappears: True
  - color_changes:
    - 5 -> 0
    - 8 -> 6
    - 6 -> 6
    - 2 -> 2
  - potential_rules:
     -  All 5s become 0.
     - if a pixel to the right of 8 is 6, then 8 stays 8, and if 8 to the left of a 6, then the 6 remains 6
     - if an 8 becomes 6 it is replaced by 6s
