    transformations:
      - action: remove
        target: object_id: 2
        details: "All gray pixels are removed (set to white)."
      - action: expand
        target: object_id: 1
        details: "Each blue pixel expands horizontally and vertically, filling connected white pixels until a non-white pixel or the grid boundary is encountered."
        constraints: "Expansion only fills locations that were originally white after removing the gray."
