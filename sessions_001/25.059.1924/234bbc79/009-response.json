The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11). The transformation appears to involve some form of object manipulation and color replacement, with spatial relationships playing a crucial role. Some colors seem to \"disappear\" or are overwritten, while others are maintained or introduced.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Copy the single blue pixel horizontally to the left and to the right, such that it covers all of the cells that used to be gray, becoming 3 blues in a row.\n4. **Other colors preserved:** Preserve all original Red (2), and green (3) pixels.\n\nIn simpler terms, The transformation removes the gray areas and expands the single blue to fill those gray spaces, without otherwise altering the Red and Green.\n"
