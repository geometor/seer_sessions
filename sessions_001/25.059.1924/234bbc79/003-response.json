The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x9 and 3x7 in this specific example pair). Certain colors in the input grid seem to be replaced or removed based on their spatial relationship with other colors. Specifically, the grey (5) pixels seem to play a crucial role in the transformation. The core colors to look for are gray(5), blue(1), and red(2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
