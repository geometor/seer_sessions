Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11). The transformation appears to involve some form of object manipulation and color replacement, with spatial relationships playing a crucial role. Some colors seem to "disappear" or are overwritten, while others are maintained or introduced.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x11
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: color_block
    properties:
      color: defined by integer value
      shape: contiguous block of same color
      location: row and column indices

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    description: Changes the color of a specific cell or block.
  - type: remove_color
    description: Changes the color of cells to white.
  - type: move_color_block
     description: changes the location

relationships:
  - adjacency: spatial relationship between color blocks (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)
  - containment:  color blocks within the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on colors gray (5), blue (1), red (2), and green (3) in the input grid.
2. **Gray Removal:** Remove all gray (5) pixels.
3. **Horizontal Expansion:** Locate the blue (1) pixel. Copy the single blue pixel horizontally to the left and to the right, such that it covers all of the cells that used to be gray, becoming 3 blues in a row.
4. **Other colors preserved:** Preserve all original Red (2), and green (3) pixels.

In simpler terms, The transformation removes the gray areas and expands the single blue to fill those gray spaces, without otherwise altering the Red and Green.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
