Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify and Remove Gray:** Locate all gray (value 5) pixels in the input grid and remove them, setting those pixels to 0 (white).
2.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Find all blue pixels (value 1).
3.  **Expand Blue:** For *each* blue pixel, expand it to fill all connected (horizontally and vertically) white pixels (value 0) that replace the gray. The expansion continues until it encounters a pixel that is not 0 (white).
4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other colored pixels (e.g., red, green) remain in their original positions and retain their original values.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
