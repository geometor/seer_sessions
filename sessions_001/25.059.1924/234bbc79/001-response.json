The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement or filtering of certain colors/numbers based on their neighbors, particularly the color gray (5). The output grids generally have fewer distinct colors than the input grids. The overall shape/dimension of the grid stays the same. It looks like the transformation depends on a \"center\" object with color gray(5), and objects around it.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
