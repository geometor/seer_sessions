The colors are represented by integers. The input grid appears to have a different size and shape compared to the output grid. Certain colors seem to disappear (e.g., gray '5'), while others are retained or change position (blue '1', red '2'). The output grid is smaller in both dimensions compared to the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
