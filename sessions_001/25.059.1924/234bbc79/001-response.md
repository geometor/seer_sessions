Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement or filtering of certain colors/numbers based on their neighbors, particularly the color gray (5). The output grids generally have fewer distinct colors than the input grids. The overall shape/dimension of the grid stays the same. It looks like the transformation depends on a "center" object with color gray(5), and objects around it.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of integers (0-9)
  - property: color
    description: Each number represents a color.
  - object: gray_pixel
    value: 5
    description: Pixels with the value 5 (gray).
  - object: non_gray_pixel
    description: Pixels with values other than 5.
  - relation: adjacency
    description:  Pixels can be adjacent horizontally or vertically.
  - action: replace_color
    description: Certain non-gray pixels are changed.
  - condition: center
    description: find the object(5) in the middle row.
  - condition: neighbor_horizontal
    description: Check if the horizontal neighbors of 'center' have the same color.
  - condition: neighbor_diagonal
      description: Check if the diagonal neighbors of 'center' have the same color.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 5 (gray) in the input grid.
2.  **Focus on Central Gray:** If more than one exists, determine the one is at the "center"
    in the following way: find the gray(5) in the input grid on the middle row
3.  **Horizontal Neighbors:** If horizontal neighbors of the 'center' are non-gray,
    and have the *same* value, extend those horizontally until you reach the edges of the grid or another color.
4. **Propagate Change:** Propagate this process to other object(5) on the center row.
5. **Diagonal:** From the *other* objects(5) on the original center row, if the diagonal neighbors have the same value, extend it until you reach the edges of the grid.
6.  **Replace:** Replace all the object(5) with 0.
7.  **Output:** Return the resulting modified grid.
