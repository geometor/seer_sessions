**input:**
```
4 5 4
5 5 5
4 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x716635C7AFD0>

**output:**
```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71663578C550>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two colors: yellow (4) and gray (5). The output grid contains two colors: yellow (4) and white (0). The core transformation seems to involve changing all gray pixels to yellow, and all yellow pixels to white, but a pattern must determine the final result. The input's yellow pixels form a cross shape (+) and after all grays are converted to yellow, it seems that only the initial yellow pixels become white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        type: integer
        values: [0, 4, 5]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          type: integer
          values: [ 0, 4, 5]
      - position:
          row: integer
          col: integer

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    input: pixel color
    output: new color, or same color

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    - subject: pixel
    - object: pixel
  - type: cross_shape
    - member: pixel
    - role: [center, arm]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Initial Yellow:** Identify the pixels that are yellow (4) in the input grid.
2.  **Convert Gray:** Change all gray (5) pixels to yellow (4).
3.  **Convert Original Yellow:** Change all the originally yellow pixels (identified in step 1) to white(0).
4. **Final Output** All initially gray pixels remain as yellow, and only the original yellow pixels become white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
