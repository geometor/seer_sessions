Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved replacing '5' (gray) with '0' (white) unless the '5' was diagonally adjacent to a '9' (maroon). The code correctly implements this rule. However, reviewing further examples it is clear the rule does not always hold. The core concept seems correct (conditional replacement of '5' based on diagonal neighbors), but the specific condition needs adjustment.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will examine each input-output pair, focusing on where the code's output differs from the expected output. This will reveal cases where the initial rule fails.

2.  **Gather Metrics:** Use provided `get_diagonals` and transform output.

3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the discrepancies, I'll modify the natural language program to accurately capture the *actual* transformation rule. I expect to have to account for more than simply the presence of a 9, possibly a different color, or even multiple conditions.

4.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML block to describe observations about each example.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on discrepancies and potential rule adjustments:

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    The code correctly handles this case. Input has gray squares surrounded by white, except in one case where it has a diagonal maroon neighbor. All gray become white except that case.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *Input has no 9 and yet not all 5 are changed to 0. This shows out current rule is insufficient.*

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *Similar to input 2, there are no 9 and yet not all 5 are changed to 0. This shows out current rule is insufficient.*

**Metrics:**

```
Example 1:
    Correct: True
    Differences: 0
Example 2:
    Correct: False
    Differences: 1
Example 3:
    Correct: False
    Differences: 3
```

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixels are replaced by white (0) pixels, except when diagonally adjacent to maroon (9) pixels.
      - The code's output matches the expected output.

  - example_id: 2
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixels are sometimes replaced by White (0).
      - Maroon (9) does not appear.
      - Azure (8) pixels are present. One Gray (5) is diagonally adjacent to an Azure (8) and is *not* transformed.
      - Code output and example output are different.

  - example_id: 3
    observations: |
      - Gray (5) pixels are sometimes replaced by White (0).
      - Maroon (9) does not appear.
      - Azure (8) pixels are present. Three Gray (5) are diagonally adjacent to an Azure (8) and is *not* transformed.
      - Code output and example output are different.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

Based on the analysis, the revised natural language program is:

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  If the pixel is gray (5), check its diagonal neighbors.
3.  If any diagonal neighbor is azure (8), the pixel remains gray (5).
4.  Otherwise, if a pixel has a value of 5, change the pixel's value to white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
