Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white pixels (value 0).

2.  **Magenta Preservation:** For every pixel in the input grid, if the pixel is magenta (value 6), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to magenta.

3.  **Conditional Magenta Propagation:** If a pixel in the input grid is gray (value 5) *and* is diagonally adjacent to a magenta pixel, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to magenta.

4.  **Default to White:** All other pixels in the input grid, that means, pixels that are neither magenta, nor gray that are diagonally adjacent to a magenta pixel, set the corresponding pixels in the output grid to white (value 0). This includes all non-magenta colors and gray pixels that are not diagonally adjacent to any magenta pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and updated natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of magenta propagation. However, the test results on the full training set reveal a subtle, but crucial, detail that was missed: the gray pixels that become magenta must be *exclusively* diagonally adjacent to existing magenta pixels. The original program and code doesn't include consideration of non-diagonal adjacency. The presence of gray pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to magenta pixels *prevents* the diagonally adjacent gray pixels from turning magenta.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Examine each example's input, expected output, and the actual output of the `transform` function. Identify the specific cases where the output differs from the expectation.
2.  **Refine Logic:** Modify the natural language program to incorporate the observed constraint regarding non-diagonal adjacency.
3.  **Prepare for Code Update**: Provide a YAML and natural language program, so the next agent can create the correct python code.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of what is observed. I am using a slightly modified `transform` function to print out key information and compare it to the ground truth provided in the json file.

```python
import json
import numpy as np

# Load the task data
with open('data/training/6fa7a44f.json', 'r') as f:
    task_data = json.load(f)

# the transform() and get_diagonally_adjacent_indices() functions as defined before.

def analyze_results(task_data):
  for example in task_data['train']:
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output_grid = example['output']
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)

        input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_output_np = np.array(expected_output_grid)
        predicted_output_np = np.array(predicted_output_grid)
        
        print(f"Example:")
        print(f"Input:\n{input_grid_np}")
        print(f"Expected Output:\n{expected_output_np}")
        print(f"Predicted Output:\n{predicted_output_np}")

        if not np.array_equal(expected_output_np, predicted_output_np):
            print("Differences:")
            diff = expected_output_np != predicted_output_np
            print(diff)

        print("-" * 20)

analyze_results(task_data)
```

Key Observations across examples:

*   **Example 1:** The initial example works fine, as there are no *adjacent* gray pixels, only *diagonally adjacent* ones to the magenta.
*   **Example 2:** The second example contains an adjacent gray. The program fails, as the predicted result changes the gray pixel to magenta, when it shouldn't.
*   **Example 3:** Similar to example 2, the predicted output includes changes to gray where it shouldn't.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml

  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      - height: int, variable
      - width: int, variable
      - pixels: A set of cells with color values.

  - name: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: int, one of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] representing a color.
      - row: int, row index
      - column: int, column index
      - adjacent_pixels: set of adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right)

  - name: preserve_magenta
    description: Copy magenta pixels from the input grid to the output grid.
    input: input_grid, output_grid
    logic: output_grid[r, c] = 6 if input_grid[r, c] == 6

  - name: propagate_magenta
    description: >
      Change gray pixels to magenta if they are diagonally adjacent to a magenta pixel,
      but only if they are not directly adjacent to any magenta pixels.
    input: input_grid, output_grid, magenta_pixels
    logic:
      - Find gray pixels (input_grid[r, c] == 5).
      - Check for diagonal adjacency to magenta.
      - Check for direct adjacency to magenta.
      - If diagonally adjacent and NOT directly adjacent, output_grid[r, c] = 6.

  - name: set_white
    description: Set all other pixels to white.
    input: output_grid
    logic: output_grid[r, c] = 0 for all remaining pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white pixels (value 0).

2.  **Magenta Preservation:** For every pixel in the input grid, if the pixel is magenta (value 6), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to magenta.

3.  **Conditional Magenta Propagation:** For every pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the pixel is gray (value 5):
        *   Check if it is *diagonally adjacent* to any magenta pixel.
        *   Check if it is *directly adjacent* (up, down, left, or right) to any magenta pixel.
        *   If it is diagonally adjacent to a magenta pixel AND NOT directly adjacent to any magenta pixel, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to magenta (value 6).

4.  **Default to White:** All other pixels in the input grid—those that are neither magenta, nor gray and satisfying the propagation condition—set to white (value 0) in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
