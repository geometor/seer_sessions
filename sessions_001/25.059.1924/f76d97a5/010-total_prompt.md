**input:**
```
5 5 6 6 6
6 5 5 6 6
6 6 5 5 6
6 6 6 5 5
5 6 6 6 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x716635BB8B50>

**output:**
```
6 6 0 0 0
0 6 6 0 0
0 0 6 6 0
0 0 0 6 6
6 0 0 0 6

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 5x5 grids. The input grid contains two colors: gray (5) and magenta (6). The output grid mostly consists of white (0) pixels, but retains some magenta (6) pixels from the input, and their positions appear to be related. The gray pixels in the input are replaced with white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color
      - position (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    agent: system
    parameters:
      - from_color: gray
      - to_color: white

  - name: retain_color
    agent: system
    parameters:
     - color: magenta
     - rule: "see natural language program"

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: "magenta pixels in output occupy positions of pixels in input that either were magenta, or are diagonal to the magenta pixel in the input grid."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with white (0) pixels.

2.  **Magenta Pixel Check:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.

3.  **Replacement rule:** If a pixel in the input grid is magenta (6), change the corresponding pixel in the output grid to magenta (6).

4.  **Adjacent diagoal rule:** If an input grid pixel is diagonally adjacent to any magenta pixel in the input grid, place a magenta (6) pixel in the output grid at the location that corresponds to the diagonally adjacent gray pixel.

5. **Gray replacement:** All gray pixels in the input that are not diagonally adjacent to any magenta are converted to white pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
