Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Initialize an output grid of the same size as the input, filled with white (0).
2. Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
3. If a pixel is magenta (6), set the corresponding output pixel to magenta.
4. If a pixel is gray (5) and diagonally adjacent to a magenta pixel, set the output pixel to magenta.
5. All other pixels, i.e., any gray pixels not diagonally adjacent to magenta, are converted to white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
