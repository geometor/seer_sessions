The input grids contain red (2) objects of varying shapes and sizes, against a background of white (0).  The output grids consistently show green (3) objects, smaller in area than the original red objects, and positioned within the bounding box of the input object, sometimes at what could be described as an 'inner edge'. White (0) remains unchanged. The transformation appears to focus on identifying and simplifying/reducing connected regions of a specific color.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
