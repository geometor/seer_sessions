Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Red Shapes: Locate all contiguous regions of '2' (red) pixels in the input grid.
2. Color Transformation: Change the identified pixel's value '2' to '3', thus switching color red into green.
3. Shape Abstraction:
    *   For the top-most red shape, replace it with a single '3' (green) pixel at any coordinate within the original shape bound.
    *   For the bottom-most red shape, replace it with a 2x2 block of '3' (green) pixels. The position of the top-left corner of this 2x2 block can be anywhere along the top edge of boundary of original red shape.
4. Background Preservation: All '0' (white) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
