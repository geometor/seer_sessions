Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to find a hollow red square, remove it, and replace it with a two-pixel green vertical line at the square's center. This worked for the first example, but the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in the logic: the transformation isn't solely about hollow red squares. It's about red *shapes*, and replacing with green pixels, possibly of different configuration than a vertical line.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Assumptions**: Use `code_execution` to check if the identified shape is actually a hollow square in cases where the code *succeeds*.
2.  **Identify the actual shape and location of red pixels**: Use observation to report details of the red shapes.
3.  **Analyze green pixel replacement**: Examine the placement and arrangement of green pixels in the output relative to the original red shape.
4. **Determine what red shapes are**
5.  **Refine Natural Language Program**: Update the program to reflect the generalized transformation rule, considering shape, location, and replacement logic.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

I'll use a combination of observation and, where specified, calls to a hypothetical `code_execution` to gather information. Since I can't actually execute code, I'll simulate the results based on my understanding of the provided code and grids.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** 9x9 grid with a 3x3 hollow red square.
    *   **Expected Output:** Red square replaced by two green pixels vertically centered.
    *   **Actual Output:** Matches expected.
    *   **Metrics (via simulated `code_execution`):**
        *   `find_hollow_square` returns: `((3, 3), (5, 5))` (Correct)
        * is\_hollow\_square: True

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** 11x11 grid with a 5x3 red rectangle (not square).
    *   **Expected Output:** Red rectangle replaced by two green pixels vertically centered.
    *   **Actual Output:** Red rectangle removed but the vertical green line may be offset.
    *   **Metrics (via Observation):**
        * find\_hollow\_square return None.
        * red\_pixels: a 5 x 3 rectangle
        * is\_hollow\_square: False

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** 7x7 grid with a 3x3 solid red square.
    *   **Expected Output:** Red square replaced by *one* green pixel.
    *   **Actual Output:** The red square removed but with two green pixels.
    *   **Metrics (via Observation):**
       * find\_hollow\_square returns None.
       * is\_hollow\_square: False

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Shape:** Locate all red (value 2) pixels in the input grid. Group these pixels to define a contiguous shape, regardless of whether it's a square, rectangle, or other connected form. It could be hollow or solid.
2. **Determine Centroid**: Calculate center row of the red shape.
3.  **Remove Red Shape:** Set all pixels within the identified red shape to black (value 0).
4.  **Replace with Green:**
    1.  If the red object is a solid square, replace with one green pixel at the center.
    2.  If the object is a hollow square or rectangle, replace with two green pixels, at the center row.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
