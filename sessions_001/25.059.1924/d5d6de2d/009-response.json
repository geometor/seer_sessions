The output is a 10x10 grid containing two vertically stacked green pixels (value 3). The green pixels appear to be positioned in a column near the center of where the red square was located in the input, and they are vertically adjacent. The red square \"disappears\", and the green connected component is created. It seems the original object is replaced with another object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
