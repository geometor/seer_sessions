The red shapes are replaced with green ('3') shapes.\n*   The upper red shape becomes a single green pixel.\n*   The lower red shape becomes a 2x2 block of green pixels.\n*   The relative positions of the shapes are maintained (one in the upper section, one in the lower section).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The position of the top-left corner of this 2x2 block can be anywhere along the top edge of the boundary of original red shape.\n4.  **Background Preservation:** All '0' (white) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the transformation converts red shapes to green, simplifying the top shape to a single point and maintaining the bottom shape with a 2x2 block.\n"
