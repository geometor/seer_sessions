Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Find Red Objects: Identify all contiguous regions of '2' (red) pixels in the input grid.
2. Count Red Objects: Determine the number of distinct red objects found.
3. Transformation based on count:
    * If one red object is found, replace it with a 2x2 block of '3' (green) pixels.  The top-left corner of the 2x2 block is placed at the top-left corner of the bounding box of the original red object.
    * If two red objects are found:
        * The first (top-most) red object is replaced by a single '3' (green) pixel.  The pixel is placed at the top-left corner of the bounding box of the first red object.
        * The second (bottom-most) red object is replaced by a 2x2 block of '3' (green) pixels. The top-left corner of the 2x2 block is placed at the top-left corner of the bounding box of the second red object.
4. Background Preservation: All non-red pixels from input should be zero in output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
