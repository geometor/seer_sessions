```python
"""
1. Find Red Objects: Identify all contiguous regions of '2' (red) pixels in the input grid.
2. Count Red Objects: Determine the number of distinct red objects found.
3. Transformation based on count:
    * If one red object is found, replace it with a 2x2 block of '3' (green) pixels.  The top-left corner of the 2x2 block is placed at the top-left corner of the bounding box of the original red object.
    * If two red objects are found:
        * The first (top-most) red object is replaced by a single '3' (green) pixel.  The pixel is placed at the top-left corner of the bounding box of the first red object.
        * The second (bottom-most) red object is replaced by a 2x2 block of '3' (green) pixels. The top-left corner of the 2x2 block is placed at the top-left corner of the bounding box of the second red object.
4. Background Preservation: All non-red pixels from input should be zero in output.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying red objects and transforming them based on their count. The code successfully handles cases with one or two red objects. However, by testing against *all* of the training examples we are able to expand the program to consider more general rules.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Execute the code on all training examples and compare the predicted output with the actual output. Record discrepancies.
2.  **Fact Gathering:** Create a YAML document summarizing the observations from each example, focusing on:
    *   Number of red objects in the input.
    *   Positions/bounding boxes of red objects.
    *   Observed transformations (size, shape, color of the output).
    *   Discrepancies between the provided output and the code execution.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the gathered facts and analysis, adjust the natural language program to incorporate the observed rules and exceptions. The goal is to create a program that accurately describes the transformation for *all* training examples.

**Code Execution and Metrics Gathering:**

I'll simulate code execution and observation. In a real environment, I'd use a Python interpreter to run the `transform` function on each input grid. I can derive the metrics using numpy functions on the input and the target output grids.

Here's an analysis of each example, including simulated code execution and comparison:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Single red object (2x2 square).
*   **Expected Output:** Green 2x2 square at the same location.
*   **Code Execution Result:** Correct (Green 2x2 square).
*   **Discrepancy:** None.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Two red objects (single pixels).
*   **Expected Output:** Top red pixel becomes a green pixel, the bottom red pixel becomes a 2x2 green square.
*   **Code Execution Result:** Correct.
*   **Discrepancy:** None.

**Example 3:**

* **Input:** Three red objects.
* **Expected Output:** Top two red objects become single green pixels, bottom becomes 2x2 green object
* **Code Execution:** The program does not handle this condition
* **Discrepancy:** Large difference in non-zero pixels.

**YAML Fact Document:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      red_count: 1
      red_shapes: [[2,2]]  # Assuming a 2x2 square
    output_objects:
      green_count: 1
      green_shapes: [[2, 2]]
    transformation: Red object replaced by green object of the same shape and size.
    discrepancy: None

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      red_count: 2
      red_shapes: [[1,1], [1,1]]
    output_objects:
      green_count: 2
      green_shapes: [[1,1],[2,2]]
    transformation: Top red object becomes a single green pixel, bottom red object becomes a 2x2 green square.
    discrepancy: None
    
  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      red_count: 3
      red_shapes: [[1,1], [1,1], [1,1]]
    output_objects:
      green_count: 3
      green_shapes: [[1,1],[1,1], [2,2]]
    transformation: >
        Top-most red object becomes green pixel.
        Second top-most red object becomes green pixel.
        Third top-most red object becomes a 2x2 green square.
    discrepancy: The current program will not transform correctly because it only considers one or two objects.

```

**Refined Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find Red Objects:** Identify all distinct contiguous regions of red (color 2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Count and Sort:** Count the number of red objects found and sort them from top to bottom based on the row of the object.
3. **Transformation Rules**
    *   The top-most object is replaced by a single green (color 3) pixel in the top-left corner of its bounding box.
    *   The second top-most object (if present) is replaced by a single green (color 3) pixel at the top-left corner of its bounding box.
    *   The third top-most object (if present) is replaced by a 2x2 green block of pixels at the top-left corner of its bounding box.
    *   If there are more than 3 red objects, apply the rule for the third object to the all remaining objects.
4.  **Background:** All non-red pixels in the input grid should remain black (color 0) in the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
