<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=832x720 at 0x71663D5B23D0>Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program:

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids (2D arrays) of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Color Swapping/Replacement:** The core transformation seems to involve a kind of color substitution or swapping, but it's not a simple one-to-one mapping. Some colors remain unchanged.
*   **Context-Dependent Change:** The change of a pixel's color appears to depend on its neighbors, or perhaps its position relative to other colors.
*   **Symmetry/Asymmetry**: There is no immediately obvious symmetry in the transformations.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: SwapColors
    description: Replaces certain colors with other colors based on a yet-to-be-determined rule.
    parameters:
        - original_color
        - replacement_color

relationships:
  - type: Adjacency
    description: A pixel can be adjacent to other pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonally).
  - type: ColorFrequency
    description: Some colors are more prevalent in certain regions or the entire grid.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each pixel:
    *   If the pixel's color is 5 (gray), and color 8(azure) is *anywhere* in input, replace it with 8 (azure).
    *   If the pixel's color is 8 (azure), and color 5(gray) is *anywhere* in input, replace it with 5 (gray).
3. **Preservation:** All other pixels retain their original color.

The rule seems to be the mutual replacement of 5 and 8 if both are somewhere within input, with no dependence on adjacency.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
