Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program:\n\n**Perception of Elements**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids (2D arrays) of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   **Color Swapping/Replacement:** The core transformation seems to involve a kind of color substitution or swapping, but it's not a simple one-to-one mapping. Some colors remain unchanged.\n*   **Context-Dependent Change:** The change of a pixel's color appears to depend on its neighbors, or perhaps its position relative to other colors.\n*   **Symmetry/Asymmetry**: There is no immediately obvious symmetry in the transformations.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
