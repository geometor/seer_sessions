Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **First Row Transformation:** The first row of the output grid consists of red pixels (value 2) placed at the x-coordinates (column indices) where red pixels were present in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Remaining Rows:** All rows from the input grid, except the first, are copied to the output grid, preserving their original order and content, *except* for the transformation described in step 3.
3.  **Last Row Red-to-Blue:** In the last row of the input grid, the rightmost red pixel (value 2) is changed to a blue pixel (value 1) in the corresponding position of the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
