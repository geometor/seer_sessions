The objects are green (3), grey(5) and orange(7).\n\n2. **Remove Object**: The grey object (color 5, a solid horizontal line across the entire row 5) is entirely removed from the output grid.\n\n3.  **Condense Rows**: The input grid's rows are condensed, possibly by taking only non-zero rows and combining.\n    *   Input rows 0, 2 and 4 are combined, preserving green(3) color.\n    *   Input rows 6, 7, 8, and 10 are combined, preserving the orange (7) color.\n\n4.  **Combine Colors in Column** The combination process for condensation results in green(3) and orange(7) that are in adjacent vertical positions in the input to share same column, if they were in the same column in the input.\n    * For example input position (2,3) is green and (8,4) and the output shows orange at (2,3) in the output.\n    * (0,1), (4,1) are green(3), (10,0) is orange and the output has orange and green colors at (4,1)\n5. Empty (all 0s) rows in the input grid are skipped or removed.\n\nIn summary, the transformation removes the grey horizontal line, merges specific rows based upon color. Columns that contain multiple colors on the vertical axis combine colors, keeping the objects in the same columns.\n"
