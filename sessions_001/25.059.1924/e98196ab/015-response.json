The colors present are white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5). The input grid appears to have distinct sections or objects based on color and arrangement. The output grid seems to be a simplified or filtered version of the input, retaining some elements while removing or altering others. The size and shape also can change in this transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
