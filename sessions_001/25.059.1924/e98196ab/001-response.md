Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grids seem to be divided into three distinct sections. The top section contains some colored pixels, the middle section is a solid gray (5) line, and the bottom section has some other colored pixels. The output grid appears to combine elements from the top and bottom sections of the input, removing the gray line. The dimensions of the top section seem to be preserved in the output. The output seems to be taking a subset of the input based on rows. The number of rows in output equals the number of rows on the top part plus the number of non-all-zero rows in bottom part, MINUS the solid gray line

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      sections: 3
      section_1: top_rows
      section_2: gray_row
      section_3: bottom_rows
      colors: [0-9]

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      colors: [0-9]

actions:
    - name: combine_sections
      inputs: [top_rows, bottom_rows]
      output: output_grid
    - name: remove_gray_row
      input: input_grid
      output: intermediate_grid
    - name: filter_bottom_rows
      inputs: [bottom_rows]
      output: [filtered_bottom_rows]
      criteria: contains non-zero elements.
    - copy_top_rows:
      input: input_grid
      output: intermediate_grid

relationships:
  - type: row_subset
    subject: output_grid
    object: input_grid
    details: "Output rows are a subset of rows from the input grid with grey line removed."

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Divide** the input grid into three sections: top, middle (solid gray line), and bottom.
2. **Copy** all rows from the top part of input to output.
3. **Identify** rows in the bottom section that contain any non-zero values.
4. **Copy** the identified bottom section rows to rows directly after top section in the output. The rows copied should keep the relative ordering to each other.
5. The middle gray row is removed entirely and not present at all on the output.
6. **Combine** the top sections and copied bottom section rows.

In simpler term: Copy Top rows. Ignore middle (all-gray) row. Copy non all-zero bottom rows below the copied top part.
