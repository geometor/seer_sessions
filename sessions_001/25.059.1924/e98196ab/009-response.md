Okay, let's analyze this input-output example to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits (0-9), representing colors.
*   There are distinct colored regions (objects) in the input.
*   The size of input grid is 11 x 11.
*   The size of output grid is 5 x 11.
*   Some colors are not in the output, like the gray '5' color.
*  It appears some of the colors are "merged", and that some rows may have been deleted

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: green (3)
    positions: [(0,1), (0,5), (0,9), (2,3), (2,8), (4,1)]
    shape: single pixels
  - id: 2
    color: gray (5)
    positions: Row 5 (all columns)
    shape: horizontal line
  - id: 3
    color: orange (7)
    positions: [(6, 10), (7, 0), (7,8), (8, 2), (8,4), (10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 10)]
    shape: single pixels

transformations:
  - action: merge_rows
    description: Certain rows appear to be merged/condensed.
  - action: remove_object
    description: Object with color gray(5) completely removed.
  - action: move_pixels
      description: The positions and relative spatial relationships of the green(3) and orange(7) are changed.
  - action: combine_colors
      description: The colors that are in proximity to one another on a vertical axis, are preserved in the same column

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify and categorize objects**: Recognize distinct colored regions (single pixels or contiguous blocks) in the input grid. The objects are green (3), grey(5) and orange(7).

2. **Remove Object**: The grey object (color 5, a solid horizontal line across the entire row 5) is entirely removed from the output grid.

3.  **Condense Rows**: The input grid's rows are condensed, possibly by taking only non-zero rows and combining.
    *   Input rows 0, 2 and 4 are combined, preserving green(3) color.
    *   Input rows 6, 7, 8, and 10 are combined, preserving the orange (7) color.

4.  **Combine Colors in Column** The combination process for condensation results in green(3) and orange(7) that are in adjacent vertical positions in the input to share same column, if they were in the same column in the input.
    * For example input position (2,3) is green and (8,4) and the output shows orange at (2,3) in the output.
    * (0,1), (4,1) are green(3), (10,0) is orange and the output has orange and green colors at (4,1)
5. Empty (all 0s) rows in the input grid are skipped or removed.

In summary, the transformation removes the grey horizontal line, merges specific rows based upon color. Columns that contain multiple colors on the vertical axis combine colors, keeping the objects in the same columns.
