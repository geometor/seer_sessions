Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of numbers, where each number represents a color. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid by a specific rule. I see numbers/colors, and contiguous areas of the same color could signify objects. The positioning and arrangement of these colored areas are also key. The solid gray line of 5's is interesting. I perceive it might be a type of inert object or separator.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - elements: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: color_block
    properties:
     - color: 0 (white)
       role: background

  - type: color_block
    properties:
      - color: 8 (azure)
      - shape: potentially isolated single pixels

  - type: color_block
        properties:
            - color: 1 (blue)
            - shape: potentially isolated single pixels

  - type: color_block
    properties:
      - color: 5 (gray)
      - shape: horizontal line

actions:
  - type: filtering #hypothesis
    description: Certain elements are removed or kept based on criteria.

relationships:
  - spatial: relative positioning of color blocks is crucial
  - line_of_5s: potentially divides the grid or acts as a boundary

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Locate all pixels with the color 8 (azure) and 1 (blue) in the input grid. Also, locate the horizontal line of 5's (gray).
2.  **Filter Based on the gray line:**
    *   Consider only azure and blue pixels that are *above* the line of 5's.
3.  **Construct the output:** Copy all the azure and blue pixels which are *above* the gray line from the input grid to exactly the same location in the output grid, keeping all of their relative positions the same.
4.   **Add 1s:** Add '1' to the output in any cell directly above or below azure '8'.
5.  **Fill Remaining**: Fill the rest with white (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
