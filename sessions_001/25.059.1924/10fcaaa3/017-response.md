Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is an 8x8 grid. The input grid contains a single red (value 2) pixel, while the rest are white (value 0). The output grid seems to expand around the red pixel, introducing azure (value 8) pixels in a pattern, and replicating the red pixel as well.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: input_grid_size is 4x4
  - observation: output_grid_size is 8x8
  - object: red_pixel
    value: 2
    input_position: (1,1) # Zero-indexed
    output_positions: [(1,1), (1,5)]
  - object: white_pixel
    value: 0
    input_positions: All except (1,1)
  - object: azure_pixel
    value: 8
    output_positions: All odd rows, odd columns
  - relationship: output_grid is double the size of the input_grid in both dimensions
  - relationship: red_pixel is duplicated in the output grid.
  - action: input red pixel appears at output position (1, 1) which corresponds to input location (1,1) x 2 - (0,0)
  - action: The red pixel is also present at column 1+4=5 in row 1. The 5 is obtained by adding 4 to the column.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double the grid size:** The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both height and width (4x4 becomes 8x8).
2.  **Copy and Translate Red:** The red pixel from the input grid is copied to the output grid at the multiplied coordinates of input (1,1) becoming output(1,1)
3.  **Horizontal Translation**: Add 4 to the column. If result is within boundary, copy the red pixel.
4. **Fill with Azure:** Fill every other cell in output with azure (8). All odd columns in odd rows contain azure.
5.  **Retain Background:** All white pixels(0) remains 0 at where they are without azure(8) or red(2).
