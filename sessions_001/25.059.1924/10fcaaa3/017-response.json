The input grid contains a single red (value 2) pixel, while the rest are white (value 0). The output grid seems to expand around the red pixel, introducing azure (value 8) pixels in a pattern, and replicating the red pixel as well.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The 5 is obtained by adding 4 to the column.\n```"

If result is within boundary, copy the red pixel.\n4. **Fill with Azure:** Fill every other cell in output with azure (8). All odd columns in odd rows contain azure.\n5.  **Retain Background:** All white pixels(0) remains 0 at where they are without azure(8) or red(2).\n\n"
