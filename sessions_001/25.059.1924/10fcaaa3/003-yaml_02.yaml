objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - cells: numerical values (0-9) representing colors
  - type: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: derived from value (using COLOR_MAP)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
  - name: replicate
    description: specific cell values are repeated in output.
  - name: introduce
    description: introduce a new color not in the input.

relationships:
  - input grid to output grid: expansion and replication
  - cell value to color: mapping (COLOR_MAP)
  - cell position: affects replication pattern
