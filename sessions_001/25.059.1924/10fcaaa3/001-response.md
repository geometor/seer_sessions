Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The input grids appear to be transformed into output grids of larger dimensions. The primary change seems to be a replication of non-zero colored pixels and insertion of lines/rows/columns of the color blue (8).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          - dimensions: variable
          - cells: contain single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - color: integer value (0-9)
          - location: (row, column) within grid
  - actions:
      - replication: Non-zero pixels are replicated in the output grid.
      - insertion:  Pixels of color 8 (blue) are inserted, creating rows and columns.
  - relationships:
      - spatial:  The relative positions of the original non-zero pixels appear to be maintained, though expanded. There's a consistent pattern related to added 8s
      - input-output: Output dimensions are larger than input dimensions.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with a value other than 0.
2. **Replicate Non-Zero Pixels:** For each non-zero pixel in the input, create a copy of that pixel in the output grid. The position will appear at every other location.
3. **Insert Blue Rows/Columns:**
    -If a row is only zeros in the input, it gets duplicated in the output, and an all blue (8) line is inserted below the duplicated row.
    - If a column is all zeros, it gets duplicated in the output, and a blue (8) column is inserted after it.
    - if a pixel at `input[r,c]` exists and it is not `0`. Put this pixel at `output[2r, 2c]`.
    - if a pixel does not exist at `input[r,c]` because the row index is out of bound, then add rows of zeros at the end and insert the all `8` rows after the just appended rows
    - if a pixel does not exist at `input[r,c]` because the col index is out of bound, then add cols of zeros at the end and insert the all `8` cols after the just appended cols

In summary, the transformation replicates non-zero pixels and expands the grid by adding rows and columns of 8s (blue) between and around the replicated pixels. All zero rows and columns are duplicated with a blue line added.
