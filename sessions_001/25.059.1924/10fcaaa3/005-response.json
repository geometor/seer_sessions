The primary colors involved are white (0), magenta (6), and azure (8). The input grid seems to be a compressed or simplified version of a pattern that is expanded in the output. The magenta (6) pixels in the input seem to be preserved and repeated in a specific pattern within the output, while azure (8) appears to be introduced as a new element filling in specific areas.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The 3x4 input becomes a 6x8 output.\n\n2.  **Magenta Replication:** Each magenta (6) pixel in the input grid is maintained in the output grid. And for every magenta, insert a magenta in a column 3 spaces to the right.\n\n3.  **Azure Fill:** All spaces immediately below a magenta, above a magenta, and all rows in between get filled with azure (8). All other pixels are left white.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the input pattern of magenta pixels, expands the canvas, replicates the pattern, and adds surrounding azure infill based on the positions of the magentas.\n"
