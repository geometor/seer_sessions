actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger output grid.
  - name: replicate
    description: Magenta pixels are replicated in a specific pattern.
  - name: fill
    description: Certain areas are filled with azure pixels.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: The input grid defines the basic pattern and placement of magenta pixels, which are then expanded and replicated in the output grid.
  - magenta_pixel_placement: The magenta pixels in the input grid determine their corresponding locations in the output grid, with a specific spacing/pattern.
  - azure_pixel_fill: Azure pixels fill the spaces around the replicated magenta pattern, potentially based on a rule related to the magenta pixel locations.
