Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is doubled in both dimensions (height and width). The 3x4 input becomes a 6x8 output.
2.  **Magenta Replication:** Each magenta (6) pixel in the input grid is maintained in the output grid. And for every magenta, insert a magenta in a column 3 spaces to the right.
3.  **Azure Fill:** All spaces immediately below a magenta, above a magenta, and all rows in between get filled with azure (8). All other pixels are left white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
