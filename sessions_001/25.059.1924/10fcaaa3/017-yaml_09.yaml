facts:
  - observation: input_grid_size is 4x4
  - observation: output_grid_size is 8x8
  - object: red_pixel
    value: 2
    input_position: (1,1) # Zero-indexed
    output_positions: [(1,1), (1,5)]
  - object: white_pixel
    value: 0
    input_positions: All except (1,1)
  - object: azure_pixel
    value: 8
    output_positions: All odd rows, odd columns
  - relationship: output_grid is double the size of the input_grid in both dimensions
  - relationship: red_pixel is duplicated in the output grid.
  - action: input red pixel appears at output position (1, 1) which corresponds to input location (1,1) x 2 - (0,0)
  - action: The red pixel is also present at column 1+4=5 in row 1. The 5 is obtained by adding 4 to the column.
