            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a simple expansion and replication of a 2x2 pattern based on color. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more complex rule. The key error is that the expansion is dependent on the position of the Yellow pixel, and that the number of 4's in the output is not consistent with the number of 4's in the input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs, paying close attention to the placement and replication of colors, *especially* yellow (4) and white (0).\n2.  **Identify the refined rule:** Determine the precise logic governing the expansion, considering the row index, the colors, and any other relevant factors. I suspect there is more complexity.\n3.  **Metrics:**\n    *   For each example, verify the shapes of the input and output grids, and note any discrepancies in the output.\n    *   Track the occurrences and positions of yellow (4) and white (0) in both input and output.\n    *   compare the pixel by pixel output of the transform function with the expected output.\n4.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** Create a detailed YAML block summarizing the observed objects, properties, and actions.\n5.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Develop a new, comprehensive natural language program that accurately captures the transformation rule, accounting for the issues identified in the additional training examples.\n\n**Metrics & Code Execution Results:**\n\nTo gather detailed metrics, I'll use `code_execution` to perform the following:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_grid_info(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    shape = grid.shape\n    yellow_count = np.sum(grid == 4)\n    white_count = np.sum(grid == 0)\n    yellow_positions = np.argwhere(grid == 4).tolist()\n    white_positions = np.argwhere(grid == 0).tolist()\n    return {\n        \"shape\": shape,\n        \"yellow_count\": yellow_count,\n        \"white_count\": white_count,\n        \"yellow_positions\": yellow_positions,\n        \"white_positions\": white_positions,\n    }\n\ndef compare_grids(grid1, grid2):\n    try:\n      diff = np.array(grid1) -

Determine its dimensions (height, width).\n    *   Identify the row index (`i`) of the yellow pixel (value 4). If no yellow pixel exists, skip the yellow-related steps.\n    *   The output will have the a height of 6, and a width equal to the input width times 2.\n\n2.  **Yellow Pixel Handling (if present):**\n    *   A single yellow pixel at `input[i,j]` in the input grid is transformed into a 2x2 block of yellow pixels in the output grid.\n    *   The yellow 2x2 block will always appear at a specific row, determined by the original yellow pixel position in the input grid:\n        *  If the yellow pixel is at row i of the input grid, the 2x2 yellow block's top-left corner is at row (2 + row), and the original column x 2.\n\n3.  **White Pixel Handling:**\n    *   Each white pixel (value 0) in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block in the output grid.\n    *   The 2x2 block has the following pattern:\n        ```\n        8 0\n        0 8\n        ```\n        where 8 represents azure and 0 represents white.\n    *   The white pixels are expanded to the 2x2 blocks, and inserted into the correct locations, skipping rows when needed to accomodate the position of the yellow block.\n\n4. **No Yellow Pixel:**\n    * If there is no yellow pixel in the input grid, white pixels are expanded in place.\n\n5.  **Output:** The resulting output grid is a transformed version of the input grid, with expanded dimensions and the 2x2 block substitutions.\n"
