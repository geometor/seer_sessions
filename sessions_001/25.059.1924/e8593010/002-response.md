"""
Transforms an input grid by replacing white (0) pixels with blue (1), red (2), or green (3) pixels, while preserving gray (5) pixels. The replacement follows a pattern where each of the new colors (blue, red, green) appears at most twice in each row and each column, and the overall count of each color is constant across examples (6 blue, 7 red, 7 green).
