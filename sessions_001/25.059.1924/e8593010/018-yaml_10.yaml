    preconditions:
      - pixel.color is white
    postconditions:
      - pixel.color changes based on row and column indices
      - if on the pixel's row index is even:
        - and the column index is even, change color to red.
        - and the column index is odd, and row index divided by two, floored, is even, change color to blue
        - and the column index is odd, and row index divided by two, floored, is odd, change color to blue.
      - if on the pixel's row index is odd:
        - and the column index is even, and the row index minus 1, divided by two, floored, is even, change color to blue
        - and the column index is even, and the row index minus 1, divided by two, floored, is odd, change color to green
        - and the column index is odd, and row index divided by two, floored, is even, change color to green.
        - and the column index is odd, and row index divided by two, floored, is odd, change color to blue.
