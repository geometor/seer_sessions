Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   The input grid primarily consists of gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
*   The output grid introduces new colors: red (2), green (3), and blue (1), while retaining some gray (5) pixels. White (0) is gone.
*   The positions of gray pixels seem to be mostly preserved, with some exceptions where new colors appear.
* The introduced colored pixels are singletons.
* It looks like the white pixels are getting replaced.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
        names: [white, blue, red, green, gray]
      position:
        type: coordinate
        values: (row, column)

transformations:
  - type: color_change
    conditions:
      input_color: 0
      output_color: [1,2,3]
    rules: "replace white with either red, blue or green, but the overall pattern is to make certain regions take certain color"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all white (0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Replace** those specific white pixels based upon their coordinate using these rules:
    *   If the white pixel is in the top left corner, the pixel is changed to a red (2).
    *   If the white pixel is the in top right, change the pixel to green (3).
    *   If the white pixel is on the bottom left, change it to blue (1).
    *   If the white pixel is in the bottom part of the central region, change it to a blue (1).
    *   If the white pixel is above that, change it to a red (2).
    *   If the white pixel is in the remaining part of the central region, change it to a green(3)

3.  **Leave** all other pixels (gray (5)) unchanged.
