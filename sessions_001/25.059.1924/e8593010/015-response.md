Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The input grid primarily consists of two colors: gray (5) and white (0).
*   The output grid introduces three new colors, while gray(5) remains: red (2), green (3), and blue (1).
* It appears the white(0) pixels have been replaced with the new colors.
* There's a clear spatial relationship: The positions of the new coloured pixels in the output corresponds to the positions of the white pixels in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: Input grid contains only gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: Output grid retains gray (5) pixels.
  - observation: White (0) pixels in the input are replaced by red (2), green (3), or blue (1) in the output.
  - relationship:  Spatial positions of gray pixels are consistent between input and output.
  - relationship: Spatial positions of new colors in the output correspond to white pixels in the input.
  - object_input:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 10x10
      colors: [gray, white]
  - object_output:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 10x10
      colors: [gray, red, green, blue]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Gray:** Copy all gray (5) pixels from the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.
2.  **Transform White:** For each white (0) pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the white cell is at an even row and an even column, replace with red(2)
    *   If the white cell is at an odd row and an odd column, replace with green(3)
    *   If the white cell is at an odd row and an even column, OR an even row and an odd column, replace with blue(1)

Essentially the white pixels are replaced by a new color based on it's row, column parity, with:
* even, even -> red
* odd, odd -> green
* even, odd or odd, even -> blue
