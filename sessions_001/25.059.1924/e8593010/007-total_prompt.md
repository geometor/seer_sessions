Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to improve the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example and successfully reproduced it. However, it failed to generalize to the other two training examples. The errors in Examples 2 and 3 indicate that the initial rule, which focused on simple coordinate-based color assignments, is too specific and doesn't capture the underlying logic of the transformation. The strategy needs to shift from hardcoded coordinates to a more generalizable pattern recognition, likely involving relative positioning and object identification.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all three training examples, paying close attention to the differences between input and output grids.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Determine if there are consistent "objects" (contiguous regions of the same color) that are being transformed.
3.  **Relative Positioning:** Instead of absolute coordinates, focus on the relative positions of objects and pixels within the grid (e.g., corners, edges, center).
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and the corresponding code incrementally, testing against all training examples after each change.

**Metrics and Observations (using print statements in the python code):**

```
Example 1:
  No differences found.
Example 2:
  Differences at indices: (array([0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8]), array([3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5]))
 location: (0,3) expected: 3  actual: 2
 location: (0,4) expected: 3  actual: 2
 location: (0,5) expected: 3  actual: 2
 location: (7,3) expected: 3  actual: 2
 location: (7,4) expected: 3  actual: 2

 location: (0,0) expected: 1  actual: 3

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: gray_rectangle
    description: A rectangle of gray (5) pixels in the center of the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: rectangle
      - location: center

  - object: blue_frame
    description: A frame of blue (1) pixels in the top-left 3x3 corner of the output.
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: L-shape or 3x3 filled corner
      - location: top-left

  - object: red_frame
    description: A frame of red (2) pixels in the top-right and bottom-right 3x3 corner of the output.
    properties:
        - color: red(2)
        - shape: L-shape or 3x3 filled corner
        - location: top-right and bottom-right

  - object: green_frame
    description: a frame of green(3) pixels along the top, left, right, and bottom edges.
    properties:
        - color: green(3)
        - shape: frame, excluding corners
        - location: edges

  - action: preserve_gray
    description: The gray rectangle in the input is preserved in the output.
    properties: {}

  - action: create_blue_frame
    description: Create blue frame in the top-left corner of the output.
    properties: {}

  - action: create_red_frame
    description: Create red frame in the top-right and bottom-right corner of the output
    properties: {}

  - action: create_green_frame
    description: Create green frame along all edges, exluding corners
    properties: {}
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve the Gray Rectangle:** The gray (5) rectangle in the input grid is copied directly to the output grid without modification.
2.  **Create a Blue Frame:** A 3x3 L-shaped (or filled square) frame of blue (1) pixels is created in the top-left corner of the output grid, regardless of the original colors in the input grid.
3.  **Create a Red Frame:** A 3x3 L-shaped (or filled square) frames of red(2) pixels are created in the top-right and bottom-right corners of the output grid.
4.  **Create a Green Frame**: Excluding any corner pixels, a one-pixel-wide frame of green(3) pixels along the edges is created.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
