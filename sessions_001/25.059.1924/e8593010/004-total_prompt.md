Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The input grid primarily consists of two colors: gray (5) and white (0).
*   The output grid introduces new colors: blue (1), red (2), and green (3).
*   The gray (5) pixels in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output. The transformation focuses on changing the white (0) pixels.
*    It appears the white pixels are getting replaced dependent on their location.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: integers (0-9)
      color_mapping:  {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 5: gray}

  - type: pixel
    properties:
     color: integer

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    input: pixel
    parameters: {original_color: integer, new_color: integer, location: tuple}
    precondition: "original_color == 0"
    description: Changes the color of white pixels based on location

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: "Pixels have (x, y) coordinates within the grid."
   - type: conditional_color_change
     description: relationship between white pixel location and its color change.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** pixels with the color value 0 (white).
3.  **Change** the color of the white pixels based on their position within the grid to the values shown in output:

    *   Change to blue (1) if the pixel is in the top left.
    *   Change to red (2) if the pixel is in the bottom right, center, or top right.
    *    Change to green (3) if the pixel is in the top or bottom row.
    *    Otherwise do not change.
4. All other pixels colors that are not 0 remain the same.

Essentially, white pixels are being recolored based on a position to one of the new colors, while all other pixels remain the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
