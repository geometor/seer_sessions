The predominant colors in the input grids are gray (5) and white (0). The output grids introduce new colors: blue (1), red (2), green (3), while retaining gray(5). The size of the grid appears to be constant (10x10) within each pair, but it's not clear if is consistent across all possible tasks. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple mirroring, rotation, or other basic geometric manipulations of the entire grid. Instead, it looks like a color substitution based on the presence and location of white (0) pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
