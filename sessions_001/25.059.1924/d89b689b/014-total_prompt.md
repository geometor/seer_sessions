Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains several distinct colored objects (single pixels or contiguous blocks of the same color). The output grid seems to be a simplified or abstracted version of the input, retaining only some of the original colors and repositioning them. The background is consistently white (0). The key seems to be identifying specific colors, possibly their positions or some aggregate property (maybe their original locations), and creating a new arrangement. The output grid appears to reduce all objects to a simple, standard shape (possibly 1x1 or a predefined formation).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: blue (1)
    shape: single pixel
    position: [0, 3]
  - id: 2
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: single pixel
    position: [0, 9]
  - id: 3
    color: azure (8)
    shape: 2x2 block
    position: [2, 5]
  - id: 4
    color: green (3)
    shape: single pixel
    position: [7, 2]
  - id: 5
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: single pixel
    position: [6, 9]
  - id: 6
    color: white (0)
    shape: background
    position: all other cells

transformations:
  - action: select
    criteria: color != white and color != azure
    objects: [1, 2, 4, 5]
  - action: reposition
    criteria: 'arrange into a 2x2 block, sort by color value'
    objects: [1, 4, 3, 6]
    new_position: [2,5]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all colored objects in the input grid. Ignore white pixels (the background).
2.  **Filter Objects:** From the found objects, ignore the azure colored block. Keep all the other objects which are all single pixels.
3.  **Sort and Arrange:** Sort the remaining objects by their color value, which is a single digit between 1 and 9 inclusive. Arrange the objects, sorted ascendingly, in a 2x2 block.
4. **Set position:** Place the 2x2 block at the coordinates occupied by the top left corner of the largest identified contiguous object (azure) in the input grid.
5.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input. Fill the entire grid with the background color (white, 0). Place the sorted 2x2 block, as in the step above.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
