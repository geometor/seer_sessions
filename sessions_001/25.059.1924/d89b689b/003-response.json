The input grid contains single-colored, isolated pixels (orange '7', magenta '6', yellow '4', maroon '9') and a 2x2 block of azure ('8') pixels. The output grid appears to be a rearrangement of some of the single-colored pixels into a 2x2 block in the center of the grid. The azure block has disappeared.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
