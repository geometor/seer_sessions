<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2048x1360 at 0x716635C5CBD0>Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The input grids contain scattered single-colored pixels and, notably, 2x2 blocks of azure (8). The output grids appear to be a compressed representation, eliminating the azure blocks and repositioning the single colored pixels. The single pixels maintain their relative positions.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

  - type: block
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - position: (top-left row, top-left column)

actions:
  - name: remove_block
    description: Removes 2x2 azure blocks from the grid.
  - name: reposition_pixels
    description: Moves the remaining single colored pixels. It takes the set of identified single pixels and arrange into adjacent position, filling them row wise.

relationships:
  - single_pixels_to_output:  The single pixels, after block are removed, are repositioned in the output, preserving their relative position ordering, and fills the output grid in the specified position.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify and Remove Blocks:** Scan the input grid to identify 2x2 blocks of azure (color 8). Remove these blocks entirely.
2. **Identify single colored pixels:** Identify all single colored pixels in the input grid (pixels which do not belong to any multi pixel block).
3. **Reposition Pixels**: Take the identified single colored pixels and arrange them into a 2x2 block in the center of the output grid. Fill the single pixels starting with the top row from left to right, and then the next row from left to right. Any remaining cell of the 2x2 block at the output are filled with 0.
4. Set the rest of the cell in output grid to 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
