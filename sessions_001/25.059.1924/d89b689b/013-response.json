The input grid contains several distinct colored objects (single pixels or contiguous blocks of the same color). The output grid seems to be a simplified or abstracted version of the input, retaining only some of the original colors and repositioning them. The background is consistently white (0). The key seems to be identifying specific colors, possibly their positions or some aggregate property (maybe their original locations), and creating a new arrangement. The output grid appears to reduce all objects to a simple, standard shape (possibly 1x1 or a predefined formation).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore white pixels (the background).\n2.  **Filter Objects:** From the found objects, ignore the azure colored block. Keep all the other objects which are all single pixels.\n3.  **Sort and Arrange:** Sort the remaining objects by their color value, which is a single digit between 1 and 9 inclusive. Arrange the objects, sorted ascendingly, in a 2x2 block.\n4. **Set position:** Place the 2x2 block at the coordinates occupied by the top left corner of the largest identified contiguous object (azure) in the input grid.\n5.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input. Fill the entire grid with the background color (white, 0). Place the sorted 2x2 block, as in the step above.\n\n"
