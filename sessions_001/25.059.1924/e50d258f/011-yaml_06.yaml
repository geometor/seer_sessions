    - input_objects:
      - {shape: rectangle, color: blue, size: [4, 5], position: top-left}
      - {shape: rectangle, color: red, size: [3, 3], position: inside_blue}
    - output_objects:
      - {shape: rectangle, color: red, size: [3, 3]}
  - example_1:
    - input_objects:
      - {shape: rectangle, color: blue, size: [4, 4], position: top-left}
      - {shape: rectangle, color: yellow, size: [2, 2], position: inside_blue}
    - output_objects:
      - {shape: rectangle, color: yellow, size: [2, 2]}
  - example_2:
    - input_objects:
        - {shape: rectangle, color: magenta, size: [6,6], position: top-left}
        - {shape: rectangle, color: red, size: [2,2], position: inside_magenta}
    - output_objects:
        - {shape: rectangle, color: red, size: [2,2]}
  - example_3:
      - input_objects:
          - {shape: rectangle, color: azure, size: [8,8], position: top-left}
          - {shape: rectangle, color: blue, size: [3,3], position: inside_azure}
      - output_objects:
          - {shape: rectangle, color: blue, size: [3,3]}
- conclusion:
    - The output grid consistently contains a smaller, colored rectangle found within a larger rectangle in the input grid. The color and size vary, but it's always a rectangle within a rectangle.
