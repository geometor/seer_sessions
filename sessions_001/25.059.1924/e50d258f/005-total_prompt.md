Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a cropping operation. It removes the outer layers of the input grid,
which are primarily white (0) and azure (8) pixels, to isolate the internal data region. 
The output grid is a 5x4 subgrid extracted from the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by cropping it to the relevant 5x4 data region.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Determine the cropping region's top-left corner.
    # We start at row 1 to skip the first all-zero row.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
