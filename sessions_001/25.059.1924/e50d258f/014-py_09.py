"""
1.  Identify Contiguous Shapes: Find all distinct, contiguous regions (shapes) of the same color within the input grid. A contiguous region is a group of pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right â€“ not diagonally).

2. Select shape(s):
   - if one shape is contained within another, select the inner shape
   - if no shapes are contained, select shape(s) by color. If only one shape of that color exists, it is the selection.

3.  Extract Selected Shape: Create the output grid by copying *only* the pixels of the selected shape(s). The output grid should be sized to perfectly fit the selected shape(s), with no extra rows or columns.
