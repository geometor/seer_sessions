Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of pixels. The input grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and 1 (blue). The output grid contains pixels of color 5 (gray) and 1 (blue). The core transformation seems to involve replacing some of the white pixels with gray pixels based on the presence and arrangement of blue pixels. There's a strong indication of a spatial or pattern-based rule governing the change.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0 (white) and 1 (blue).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 5 (gray) and 1 (blue).
  - observation: Blue (1) pixels in the input grid maintain their color and position in the output grid.
  - observation: Some white (0) pixels in the input grid are changed to gray (5) in the output grid.
  - observation: The change from white to gray is not random, implying a contextual rule.
  - relationship:  White pixels adjacent to existing blue pixels may be replaced with gray. Specifically White pixels to the left of blue pixels are converted to gray, with the exception of the bottom row. White pixels directly below blue pixels appear to be converted to blue in the bottom row.
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1]
      - dimensions: 10x10
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - colors: [1, 5]
      - dimensions: 10x10
  - action: ColorReplacement
    parameters:
      - source_color: 0
      - target_color: 5
      - condition: "White pixels to the left of Blue Pixels, except on last two rows"
  - action: ColorReplacement
    parameters:
      - source_color: 0
      - target_color: 1
      - condition: "White pixels below blue pixels in last two rows"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Blue:** Copy all blue (1) pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their exact positions.

2.  **Conditional Gray Replacement (Left):** For every white (0) pixel in the input grid, if it is to the *left* of any blue (1) pixel within the same row, and if the row is *not* the last or the second to last row, replace it with gray (5) in the output grid.

3. **Conditional Blue Replacement (Below/Bottom two rows):** White Pixels directly below blue pixels in the bottom two rows are replaced with 1.

4.  **Default Gray:** All remaining white(0) pixels in that were not colored blue in the previous step should be changed to gray (5).
