Okay, let's analyze this first example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 10x10 grid of pixels, primarily filled with 0 (white) and some 8 (azure).
*   The output is also a 10x10 grid, with 8 (azure) and 5 (gray).
*   The azure pixels in the input seem to trigger a pattern of azure and gray in the output.
*   The output seems like a flood fill with an alternating color or a chessboard like filling

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 8
        color: azure

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - value: 8
        color: azure
      - value: 5
        color: gray

actions:
  - name: fill
    type: pattern_based_fill
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    parameters:
       start_color: 8
       alternate_color: 5

relationships:
    - type: transformation
      from: input_grid
      to:  output_grid
      description: The azure pixels of the input grid initiate a checkerboard fill pattern on output grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid completely blank (or filled with a default value, which in this case is not relevant since every input position is revisited).
2.  **Locate Seeds:** Identify all the azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
3.  **Checkerboard Fill:** Starting at top-left, fill all the input grid. All locations with '8' in input becomes '8' in output. The remaining cells of the output are filled using a "checkerboard" or "alternating" pattern, starting with gray (5) to the immediate right of the top-left most "8". Horizontally and vertically adjacent cells will have different colors, with 5 (gray) and 8 (azure) alternating.
4.  If any location in the output is visited again, replace its value.

Essentially, the azure pixels in the input act as "seed" points for an azure and gray checkerboard pattern that propagates across the entire output grid, anchored at the top-left pixel in relation to the first azure seed pixel encountered.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
