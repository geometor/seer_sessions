The input grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and 1 (blue). The output grid contains pixels of color 5 (gray) and 1 (blue). The core transformation seems to involve replacing some of the white pixels with gray pixels based on the presence and arrangement of blue pixels. There's a strong indication of a spatial or pattern-based rule governing the change.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Specifically White pixels to the left of blue pixels are converted to gray, with the exception of the bottom row. White pixels directly below blue pixels appear to be converted to blue in the bottom row.\n  - object: InputGrid\n    properties:\n      - colors: [0, 1]\n      - dimensions: 10x10\n  - object: OutputGrid\n    properties:\n      - colors: [1, 5]\n      - dimensions: 10x10\n  - action: ColorReplacement\n    parameters:\n      - source_color: 0\n      - target_color: 5\n      - condition: \"White pixels to the left of Blue Pixels, except on last two rows\"\n  - action: ColorReplacement\n    parameters:\n      - source_color: 0\n      - target_color: 1\n      - condition: \"White pixels below blue pixels in last two rows\"\n```"
