**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 5x5 grid of pixels. The input grid primarily consists of red pixels (value 2) with a single white pixel (value 0) in the center. The output grid also has red and white pixels, but the white pixels now form a cross or plus (+) shape centered where the original white pixel was.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - color: white (0)

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0, 2] # White and Red

actions:
  - name: transform_grid
    input: 5x5 grid
    output: 5x5 grid
    description: Changes the arrangement of white and red pixels.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The white pixel in the input is centered.
  - type: spatial
    description: The white pixels in the output form a cross shape, centered at the original white pixel's location.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the center:** Locate the single white pixel (value 0) in the input grid. This establishes the center point.
2.  **Create a cross:** In the output grid, change the color of the pixels directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the center pixel to white (value 0).
3. **Maintain the exterior**: All cells that do not become part of this cross, and were red before, stay the same color, which is red.
4.  **Center cell**: Change the color of the center pixel to white (value 0).

In essence, the transformation rule is to replace the single central white pixel with a cross-shaped arrangement of white pixels, keeping all other pixels red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
