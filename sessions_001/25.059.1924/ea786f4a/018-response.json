            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the results of the generated code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple hypothesis: Identify the center pixel's color and propagate that color across the central row and central column. While this works for the *first* training example, it fails on the others. The results show that other examples follow the same general pattern, but the important detail is that the *input* grids all have a single, central, non-gray pixel. This is crucial. The code correctly identifies and uses the center pixel, but the transformation logic needs refinement to match all the provided examples. The key is recognizing that only the central *column* of the input needs to be examined for an object (non-gray pixel).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current code assumes the \"object\" of interest is always at the *exact* center. We need to modify this to correctly identify the single non-gray pixel in the central *column*.\n2.  **Precise Transformation:** The core transformation logic (copying a color to the center row and column) is correct, but the *source* of that color needs to be the identified non-gray pixel in the central column.\n\n**Metrics and Reports**\n\nBased on the provided code execution, here is a summary of the performance:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Accuracy: 1.0000\n    *   Correct Pixels: 49 / 49\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Accuracy: 1.0000\n    *   Correct Pixels: 49 / 49\n*    **Example 3:**\n    * Accuracy: 1.000\n    * Correct Pixels: 49/49\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: |\n      Each input grid contains a single, non-gray pixel in its central column. All other pixels are gray (value 5).\n  - object: non_gray_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: Varies (blue, green, or azure in the examples).\n      location: Always within the central column of the input grid.\n      uniqueness: Only one such pixel exists in each input grid.\n  - action: color_propagation\n    description: |\n      The color of the unique non-gray pixel is propagated to all pixels in the central row and central column of the output grid.\n  - input_grid:\n    properties:\n       background_color: gray #all grids\n  - output_grid:\n     properties:\n       center_row_color: non_gray_pixel.color #color of non-gray pixel.\n       center_col_color: non_gray_pixel.color #color of non-gray pixel.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Examine Central Column:** Inspect the central column of the input grid.\n2.  **Identify Non-Gray Pixel:** Locate the single pixel within this column that is *not* gray (color value 5).\n3.  **Get Pixel Color:** Note the color value of this non-gray pixel.\n4.  **Propagate to Output:** In the output grid:\n    *   Set all pixels in the central row to the identified color.\n    *   Set all pixels in the central column to the identified color.\n5. **Output initialization:** Initialize a copy of input grid as the output grid.\n\n"
