- SurroundingPixels:
    description: All pixels except the central pixel.
    properties:
      color:  Alternates between 0 (white) and 1 (blue) in relation to the center, but *not* simply based on (row + col) % 2
      pattern: The precise alternation rule is to be refined.  It's NOT a global checkerboard.
