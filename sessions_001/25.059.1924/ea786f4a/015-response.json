The input grid appears to have a single \"0\" (white) pixel in the center, surrounded by \"3\" (green) pixels. The output grid transforms the input by creating a symmetrical cross or plus-shape pattern of \"0\" (white) pixels, extending from the center to the edges.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the color of the central pixel and extends it outwards in horizontal and vertical lines to create a cross shape.\n"
