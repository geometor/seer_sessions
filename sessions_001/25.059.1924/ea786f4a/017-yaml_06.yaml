    objects:
      - object_id: center_pixel
        description: Pixel at the center of the grid.
        properties:
          color: Changes to the central pixel
          row: center
          col: center
      - object_id: row_pixels
        description: Pixels in the same row as the center pixel.
        properties:
          color: changes if original color is the same with the center pixel
          row: Same as center_pixel
          col: Varies
      - object_id: col_pixels
        description: Pixels in the same column as the center pixel.
        properties:
          color: changes if original color is the same with the center pixel
          row: Varies
          col: Same as center_pixel
    actions:
      - action_id: propagate_color
        description: The color of the center pixel propagates along its row and column.
        condition: Propagation stops when a pixel of a different color is encountered.
