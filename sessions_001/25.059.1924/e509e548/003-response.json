The input grid contains green (3) pixels forming various shapes, some isolated, some connected. The output grid appears to have a corresponding color for each green object in the input, with connected components of green seemingly grouped and represented with unique colors. The background (0) remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Consider two green pixels adjacent if they share a side (not just a corner).\n2.  **Assign Output Colors:** For each *distinct* green connected component identified:\n    *   If a component consists of a single, isolated green pixel, map the pixel in the output with the color blue (1).\n    *   If the component has multiple horizontally or vertically adjacent green pixels, find the top left pixel within each unique component and map the component with red (2) if top left's column index is less than 5 else map it with color magenta(6).\n3.  **Preserve Background:** All white (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output.\n\nIn summary, the transformation detects connected components of green pixels and replaces each distinct component by a unique color, with single-pixel components being blue, and multi-pixel components being represented by red or magenta based on its location. The background remains unchanged.\n"
