Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The primary colors involved appear to be green (3) in the input, and blue (1), magenta (6), and red (2) in the output. It seems like the transformation involves recoloring connected regions of green pixels in the input to distinct colors in the output. The background color white (0) remains unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10, 11] # Height, Width
      background_color: 0 # White

  - type: connected_region
    properties:
      input_color: 3 # Green
      output_colors: [1, 6, 2] # Blue, Magenta, Red
      connectivity: orthogonal # side-by-side, not diagonal

actions:
  - type: recolor_region
    input: connected_region
    parameters:
         new_color: output.color

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: grid
    to: connected_region

  - type: same_dimensions
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Connected Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Contiguous means connected orthogonally (up, down, left, or right).

2.  **Recolor Regions:** For each identified green region:
    *   If the region is at the top left of the image (the leftmost pixel in the region has x and y coordinates that are lesser or equal to all pixels), change all its pixels to blue (1).
    *   If the region is at the bottom left of the image, change all its pixels to red (2).
    *   If the region is at the top right of the image, change its pixels to magenta(6).
    *    All white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

In essence, the program detects separate green areas and recolors each one based on its position within the grid.
