Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Green Pixels**: Locate all pixels with a value of 3 (green) within the input grid.
2. **Determine the Overall Center:** calculate the center point by getting the minimum and maximum of both row and column.
3.  **Transform Based on Quadrant**: For each green pixel:
    *   If the pixel is in the top-left relative to the calculated center, change its color to magenta (6).
    *    If the pixel is in the top-right or bottom-left, change its color to blue (1).
    *   If the pixel is the bottom-right relative to the center, change its color to red (2).
4.  **Output**: The output grid is the input grid with the green pixels transformed according to the quadrant rule.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
