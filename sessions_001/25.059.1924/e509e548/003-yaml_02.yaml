facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains pixels of colors 0 (white) and 3 (green).
  - observation: Output grid contains pixels of colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), and 6 (magenta).
  - object_type: GreenComponent
    properties:
      color: 3
      pixels: List[Tuple[int, int]]  # List of (row, col) coordinates
      connected: bool                 # True if pixels form a connected component
  - relationship: Input green components map to output colored components.
  - relationship: Each connected green component in the input is represented by a unique color in the output.
  - action: ColorMapping
    input: GreenComponent
    output_color: int # Determined based on connectivity and possibly a sequential assignment
  - background: Background color 0 remains unchanged in both input and output.
