The input grid contains a single red (2) pixel surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid retains the red pixel in the same location, but some of the surrounding white pixels are changed to blue (1). The blue pixels appear to form a 3x3 square around the red pixel, with the red pixel at its center. However, the blue square extends only to rows and columns that exist in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
