The input grid contains single pixels of different colors (red, green, azure) scattered on a background of white (represented by 0). The output grid seems to introduce blue (1) pixels, forming a shape around a cluster of original pixels. There is a potential interaction or expansion based on the position of non-white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The red shape from the input grid, is filled.\n5.  **Preserve Other Colors:** The green and blue pixels at their original locations are preserved.\n\nIn summary it looks like the rule relates the input grid objects to a translated and filled object in the output grid, and the new object overwrites the location of the original object.\n"
