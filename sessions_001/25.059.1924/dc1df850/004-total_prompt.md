Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and magenta (6). The output grid introduces a new color, blue (1), while retaining the red (2) and magenta (6) pixels in their original positions. The key change seems to be the selective replacement of white (0) pixels with blue (1) pixels in the top-left region of the grid. The boundaries of this blue region appear to be related to the positions of the red pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and magenta (6).
  - observation: |
      The output grid retains the red (2) and magenta (6) pixels in their original locations.
  - observation: |
     The output introduces blue pixels (1).
  - relationship: |
      The blue pixels replace some of the white pixels.
  - constraint: |
      The magenta pixel seems unchanged in its color.
  - constraint: |
      The blue fills above the row of the magenta pixel
  - boundary: |
      The blue region's right boundary appears to be defined by a vertical line extending upwards from the right-most red pixel or even the edge of the image
  - boundary: |
      The blue region's bottom boundary appears to be defined by a horizontal line just above the magenta pixel, and just below the lowest red pixel.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Non-White Pixels:** Copy all pixels that are *not* white (0) from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions. Specifically, the red (2) and magenta (6) pixels remain unchanged.

2. **Define Blue Region:**
    *   Locate the row containing magenta pixel.
    *    Locate the column containing the right-most red pixel.
   
3.  **Fill with Blue:** Change the color of the pixels above the row of the magenta pixel to blue (1) and stopping at the defined boundaries and the red pixels.

4.  **Leave Other Pixels Unchanged:** All other white (0) pixels in the input which are not within the defined region remain white (0) in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
