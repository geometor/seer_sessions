The core transformation seems to involve identifying non-zero colored pixels in the input and creating a \"halo\" of blue (value 1) pixels around them in the output. The original non-zero pixels seem to be preserved.  Zero-valued (white) pixels remain unchanged, unless influenced by the halo.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
