facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (input: 4x5, output: 4x5)
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - object: pixel
    type: cell within grid
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

  - observation: input_red_pixel
    details: single red (2) pixel in the input grid
    position: (1, 1)

  - observation: output_red_pixel
    details: red (2) pixel remains in the same location in the output grid
    position: (1, 1)

  - observation: blue_pixels
    details: white (0) pixels surrounding the red pixel are changed to blue (1)
    shape: 3x3 square centered on red pixel
    constraint:  blue pixels only appear on rows and cols available in the input grid
