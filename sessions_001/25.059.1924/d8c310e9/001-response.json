Here's a breakdown of my observations, a YAML block summarizing the facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are rectangular grids of varying sizes. The examples all seem to have the same width but different height.\n*   **Colors:**  Pixels within the grids have integer values 0-9, representing different colors. 0 is prevalent, acting like a background. Other colors appear in contiguous blocks.\n*   **Repetition/Extension**: The bottom row of the input seems to be \"extended\" or \"repeated\" to the right in the output. Specifically, the non-zero colored sections repeat. The sequence present in input is preserved in output, only extended.\n*   **Symmetry Check**: It is easy to think about mirroring, but it not simple as horizontal or vertical, so the repetition/extension idea is more inline with a solution.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
