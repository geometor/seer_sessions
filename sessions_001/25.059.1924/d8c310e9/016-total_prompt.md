Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The colors present are white (0), yellow (4), green (3), and red (2). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x15). The primary change appears to be a horizontal mirroring or reflection of a subset of the non-white pixels, specifically within the colored area. The white pixels seem to act as a background and aren't involved in the transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x15
      elements: pixels
      background_color: white (0)

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      colors:
        - white (0)
        - yellow (4)
        - green (3)
        - red (2)

  - type: colored_region
    properties:
      shape: irregular
      bounds: rows 3-5, columns 0-10 (input); varies slightly (output)

actions:
  - type: horizontal_reflection
    properties:
     region: colored_region

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: grid contains pixels
  - type: boundary
    description: white pixels form the boundary of the colored region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the colored region:** Locate the contiguous block of non-white pixels within the grid. In this specific example, it is bounded from row index 2 (inclusive) to 4 (inclusive). The column indices differ from row to row.
2.  **Horizontal Reflection:** Within each row of the colored region, reflect or mirror the colored pixels horizontally. This reflection needs to be performed taking into consideration, the rightmost extent of the object. Let's analyze row-wise:
    *   **Row 3**:
        *   Input has yellow at index 0, and two yellows starting at index 5.
        *   Output has two yellows starting at index 5 and two yellows starting at index 10. It appears that there is an insertion on the right, mirroring, the two yellows at index 5
    *   **Row 4**:
        *   Input is `4 3 0 0 3 4 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
        *   Output is `4 3 0 0 3 4 4 3 0 0 3 4 4 3 0`. The part `3 4 4 3` starting at index 5 has been mirrored and inserted starting at index 10
    *   **Row 5**:
        *  Input: 4 3 2 2 3 4 4 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
        *  Output: 4 3 2 2 3 4 4 3 2 2 3 4 4 3 2. Similar to row 4, the segment `3 4 4 3 2` has been mirrored, and inserted on the right.
3.  **Preserve Background:** The white (0) pixels remain unchanged.

In essence, the transformation identifies segments of colored pixels within the colored area and mirrors and appends them at the right edge of each row.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
