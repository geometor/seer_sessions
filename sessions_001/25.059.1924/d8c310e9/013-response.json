            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the derived code were based on the first training example. The execution on subsequent examples revealed discrepancies, indicating that the initial program was incomplete or over-specific. The strategy to resolve this is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine each input-output pair where the code failed. Identify the specific elements or patterns that were not handled correctly.\n2.  **Generalize the Rule:** Modify the natural language program to be more general and encompass the observed behavior across all training examples. Focus on identifying the *core* transformation rule, rather than just mimicking the first example.\n3. **Refine object properties**: refine the selection criteria for the objects in the transform.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the revised code and natural language program against all training examples again. Repeat the analysis and refinement process until all training examples are handled correctly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo better understand the errors, let's define and extract key metrics:\n*   **Correct Output:** Does our generated output match the example's output exactly?\n*   **Red Block Locations (Input):** Record the row and column indices of all 2x1 vertical red blocks in the input grid.\n* **Red Block in Rows 3 and 4?**: Check if there exist red blocks in third and fourth rows.\n* **Alternating Pattern:** Check if the \"every other\" extension is accurate for all.\n\nHere's a summary of the execution results, augmented with these metrics:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_vertical_red_blocks(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    red_blocks = []\n    for r in range(rows - 1):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2 and grid[r+1][c] == 2:\n                red_blocks.append((r, c))\n    return red_blocks\n\ndef code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, expected_output_grid):\n\n    # 1.
