The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and blue (1). The input grid seems to have a specific pattern of red and blue pixels in the last two rows, while the rest of the grid is white. The output grid maintains the general structure but extends the pattern of red and blue pixels horizontally.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically, note the arrangement where blue pixels interrupt sequences of red pixels.\n\n2.  **Replicate the Pattern:** Duplicate the two-row pattern identified in step 1.\n\n3. **Extend horizontally:** Instead of creating a separate copy, extend the original pattern by copying and inserting it next to the pattern, repeatedly across the entire width of the grid, maintaining the original two rows' height. In this example, copy the first block of 2 red and insert, copy 2 red insert, etc.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation rule takes the pattern found on the last two rows and replicates it horizontally across the entire width of the last two rows.\n"
