Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the derived code were based on the first training example. The execution on subsequent examples revealed discrepancies, indicating that the initial program was incomplete or over-specific. The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Analyze Discrepancies:** Carefully examine each input-output pair where the code failed. Identify the specific elements or patterns that were not handled correctly.
2.  **Generalize the Rule:** Modify the natural language program to be more general and encompass the observed behavior across all training examples. Focus on identifying the *core* transformation rule, rather than just mimicking the first example.
3. **Refine object properties**: refine the selection criteria for the objects in the transform.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the revised code and natural language program against all training examples again. Repeat the analysis and refinement process until all training examples are handled correctly.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the errors, let's define and extract key metrics:
*   **Correct Output:** Does our generated output match the example's output exactly?
*   **Red Block Locations (Input):** Record the row and column indices of all 2x1 vertical red blocks in the input grid.
* **Red Block in Rows 3 and 4?**: Check if there exist red blocks in third and fourth rows.
* **Alternating Pattern:** Check if the "every other" extension is accurate for all.

Here's a summary of the execution results, augmented with these metrics:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_vertical_red_blocks(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    red_blocks = []
    for r in range(rows - 1):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 2 and grid[r+1][c] == 2:
                red_blocks.append((r, c))
    return red_blocks

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, expected_output_grid):

    # 1. Correct Output
    correct_output = np.array_equal(output_grid, expected_output_grid)

    # 2. Red Block Locations
    red_block_locations = find_vertical_red_blocks(input_grid)
    
    # 3. Red Blocks in 3rd and 4th Row
    red_blocks_in_rows_3_4 = any(r in [2, 3] for r, _ in red_block_locations)

    print(f"  Correct Output: {correct_output}")
    print(f"  Red Block Locations (Input): {red_block_locations}")
    print(f"  Red Blocks Exist in Rows 3 and 4: {red_blocks_in_rows_3_4}")

  Red Blocks Exist in Rows 3 and 4: True

  Red Block Locations (Input): [(3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5)]
  Red Blocks Exist in Rows 3 and 4: True
Example 3:
  Correct Output: False
  Red Block Locations (Input): [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
  Red Blocks Exist in Rows 3 and 4: True

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_block
    type: vertical_block
    color: red
    size: 2x1
    locations: []  # To be filled dynamically for each example

actions:
  - name: copy
    description: Duplicate an object from the input to the output.
    parameters: {}

  - name: extend
    description:  Extend vertical red block two cells to the right.
    parameters:
        object: red_block

  - name: filter_by_row
    description: consider objects starting on specific rows
    parameters:
        rows: [2,3] # zero indexed, so 2 and 3 are third and fourth rows
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify 2x1 Vertical Red Blocks:** Locate all 2x1 vertical blocks of red (color 2) pixels in the input grid, but *only* if they start in the third or fourth row (zero-indexed rows 2 and 3).
2.  **Copy Red Blocks:** Copy the identified vertical red blocks to the same location in the output grid.
3.  **No Extensions**: Do not extend any red blocks.

The "every other" extension and copying of the last row was incorrect and needs to be removed. The row filter is crucial.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
