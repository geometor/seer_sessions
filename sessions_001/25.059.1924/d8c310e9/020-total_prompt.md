Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on identifying colored regions and extending them to the right by their original width. The testing results reveal that while this approach works for some cases, it's incomplete and needs refinement. The core issue is that the extension goes beyond the initial boundary of the input image. The right-side duplication fills in the region to the size of the original image.

The strategy for improvement should include:
1.  **Bounding Box Correction**: ensure pixels placed do not exceed boundary of original image.
2. **Region Identification Refinement**: refine the concept of colored regions.
3. **Transformation Logic Adjustment**: The duplication process needs to be more precise, reflecting the observed behavior in all examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the specific issues, I'll examine each example using the provided data to check for correct transformations.

Here are the results of executing `transform` on the training inputs:

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: colored_region
    description: A contiguous block of non-white pixels (including single pixels).
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the region.
      - shape: The arrangement of pixels (can be a single pixel, a line, a block, etc.).
      - bounding_box: The smallest rectangle that contains the entire region.
      - width: bounding_box.width
actions:
  - name: duplicate_right
    description: >-
      Duplicates the colored region immediately to its right, within the
      confines of the original grid.
    parameters:
      - region: The colored region to duplicate.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Colored Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of non-white pixels in the input grid. Consider each isolated non-white pixel as its own region.
2. **Duplicate Regions to the Right**: For each identified region, duplicate every pixel immediately to the right of the original position. The copied region should be the exact same as the original region.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
