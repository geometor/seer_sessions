Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and blue (1). The input grid seems to have a specific pattern of red and blue pixels in the last two rows, while the rest of the grid is white. The output grid maintains the general structure but extends the pattern of red and blue pixels horizontally.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 15
      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: contiguous horizontal blocks
  - type: pixel_block
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      shape: single pixels interspersed within the red blocks
  - type: background
    properties:
       color: white(0)

actions:
  - type: extend_pattern
    description: The pattern of red and blue pixels in the bottom two rows is extended horizontally.

relationships:
  - The red and blue pixels form an alternating pattern in the bottom rows.
  - The pattern in the last two rows is copied and extended to the right.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:** Locate the bottom two rows of the input grid. Observe the alternating pattern of red (2) and blue (1) pixels. Specifically, note the arrangement where blue pixels interrupt sequences of red pixels.

2.  **Replicate the Pattern:** Duplicate the two-row pattern identified in step 1.

3. **Extend horizontally:** Instead of creating a separate copy, extend the original pattern by copying and inserting it next to the pattern, repeatedly across the entire width of the grid, maintaining the original two rows' height. In this example, copy the first block of 2 red and insert, copy 2 red insert, etc.

In simpler terms, the transformation rule takes the pattern found on the last two rows and replicates it horizontally across the entire width of the last two rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
