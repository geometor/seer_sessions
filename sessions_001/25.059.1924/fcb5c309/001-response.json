The input grids have varying dimensions and contain multiple colors, while the output grids are smaller, have a consistent square-like shape, and mostly consist of a single color with some background (white/0) pixels. The key seems to be identifying a specific color in the input and creating a bounding box around it in the output. Other colors appear to be irrelevant to the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This is the \"target color\". In the first example its 4 (yellow), in the second it's 3 (green), in the third it is 2 (red).\n\n2. **Find the Bounding Box:** In the input grid, find the minimum and maximum row and column indices where the target color appears. This defines a rectangular bounding box.\n\n3. **Create the Output Grid:** Create a new grid.\n    -   The dimensions of this new grid are determined by the size of the bounding box (max_row - min_row + 1, max_col - min_col + 1).\n    -   Fill all cells within the bounding box with the target color.\n    -   Iterate over the cells of the original input. If a cell in the input grid is equal to 0 and is positioned inside the bounding box set corresponding output cell to 0.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts a rectangular region from the input grid based on the extent of a specific color and fills it with target color, preserving inner '0' pixels.\n"
