The background is white (0).  The output grid is significantly smaller and seems to focus on the red (2) pixels, with the rest being white (0). The output grid appears to maintain the approximate relative positioning and shape of the red areas in the input, but scales it down and crops/removes surrounding parts. It captures the \"essence\" of the red shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider these pixels as forming the target shape.\n2.  **Extract:** Isolate the target shape (red pixels) from other elements (green pixels and white background).\n3.  **Reduce and Center:** Reduce the size of the extracted shape while approximately preserving its original form. Imagine finding a bounding box around the red pixels and shrinking it, keeping only internal parts.\n4. **Create Output Grid**: Create a smaller, empty output grid with all white (0) values\n5. **Transfer and set color:** Place the reduced red shape onto the output grid. Replace all non red values with white (0)\n6. **Complete Output** The output grid is now complete, it contains the reduced and centered red pixels surrounded by white.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts the red shape, scales it down, and places it on a white background. The green shapes and large portions of white surrounding the red area are discarded.\n"
