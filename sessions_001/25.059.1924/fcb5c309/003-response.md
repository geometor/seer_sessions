Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9). We see colors like white (0), yellow (4), and red (2).
*   The output is a smaller grid, also with colored pixels, primarily yellow (4) and white (0).
*   The output seems to be a condensed or abstracted version of the input.
*   The yellow pixels in the output seem to correspond to the yellow pixels, and potentially other structures, in the input.
*    There appears to be a focus on creating a bounding box from the outmost yellow pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Outermost Yellows:** In the input grid, locate all yellow (4) pixels. Among these, identify the ones that form the extreme top, bottom, left, and right boundaries.

2. **Construct Bounding Box:** From those outermost yellow pixels create a rectangle that is defined by those extremes. In the case of this specific example the box's corners appear to be defined by the outermost yellow pixel.

3.  **Fill and Render:** Create a new grid. Make the border (exterior pixels) of the grid yellow. If the corresponding pixel in the input grid is yellow, or is inside the bounding box, make it yellow. Otherwise make the pixel in the output grid white.
