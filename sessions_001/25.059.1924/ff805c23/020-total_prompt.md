1.  Identify the grey (5) object: Find the contiguous block of grey (value 5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine Object Dimensions**: Calculate the height and width of this grey object's bounding box.
3. Create output**: Create the output with the height and width same as the grey object's height and width.
4. Fill the output**: Fill the output grid, copying grey pixels by their relative positions within the grey object's bounding box. For example. The top-left pixel of the bounding box in input will correspond to position (0,0) in output grid.
5. All the grey colored pixels within the object's bounding box should be present in output.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a grey object. The code correctly identified and extracted the grey object in the first example. However, subsequent examples reveal that the task is NOT just about the grey object. It copies pixels of ALL colors within the bounding box of grey object.

The primary issue is that the initial program *overfit* to the first example. It focused solely on grey pixels, and missed the multi-colored object.

The strategy to address this is:

1.  **Broaden the Scope:** Modify the natural language program to include copying all colors within the bounding box identified, not just the grey ones.
2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Ensure the bounding box concept is correctly implemented and captures the full extent of the intended object.
3.  **Iterative Improvement:** Keep the observation, program and code paradigm. Update each and test thoroughly.

**Example and Results Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of the results, augmented with some `code_execution` derived metrics:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(examples, transform_function):
    results = []
    for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(examples):
        predicted_output = transform_function(input_grid)
        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
        predicted_output = np.array(predicted_output)

        # Basic metrics
        input_shape = input_grid.shape
        expected_shape = expected_output.shape
        predicted_shape = predicted_output.shape
        correct = np.array_equal(expected_output, predicted_output)


        results.append({
            "example": i + 1,
            "input_shape": input_shape,
            "expected_shape": expected_shape,

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Grey Object:** Find the contiguous block of grey (value 5) pixels in the input grid.  This forms the "target object".
2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Calculate the bounding box of the *target object*. This is the smallest rectangle that fully encloses all grey pixels of the target object.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with dimensions equal to the height and width of the bounding box.
4.  **Copy Pixels within Bounding Box:** Iterate through each cell within the bounding box in the *input* grid. Copy the color of the pixel at that location to the corresponding location in the *output* grid. The top-left corner of the bounding box in the input maps to position (0, 0) in the output grid.
5. **Ignore the isolated grey objects**: Grey objects that do not form a contiguous object with any other color should be ignored.

The key change is step 4. Instead of only copying grey pixels, we now copy *all* pixels within the bounding box, regardless of their color. Step 5 clarifies further based on the last example provided.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
