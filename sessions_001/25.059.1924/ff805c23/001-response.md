Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grids are larger and more complex, while the output grids are smaller and seem to represent a zoomed-out or simplified version of a specific colored object in the input. The core colors involved seem to vary across examples, but the general concept is consistent. It appears the other colors may be noise or irrelevant to the final result.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of colored pixels
    properties:
      - height
      - width
      - color_values (0-9)

  - type: object
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
    - color
    - bounding_box:
        description: smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of that color

  - type: transformation
    description: Reduction of input grid to a smaller output grid.
    actions:
      - identify_target_object: Find primary object of the output color, based on a repeating color pattern.
      - extract_bounding_box: Get bounding box of this object, ignoring other objects.
      - downsize: Reduce size of original grid to output grid.
      - select_pixels: Take only pixels that have colors of corners

  - type: relationship
    description: "Output is a downsized representation of the largest object's repeated pattern in the input"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the repeating color pattern:** Examine the output grid. Note its dimensions and the colors of the pixels, and any simple repetitions within it.
2.  **Locate Primary Object in Input:** Find the object in the *input grid* whose color is the most prominent.
3. **Determine Corner Pattern:** The colors that form a rectangle at the corners of the input grid, make up the transformation.
4.  **Extract Relevant Pixels:** The output grid only includes pixels that are within the bounding box and also have colors that correspond to the corner rectangle colors.
5.  **Create Output Grid:** Reduce output to a smaller size grid as shown in the output by getting the corners of the primary object and the repeated pattern of colors in the corners.

In essence, the transformation identifies a specific colored object within the input grid, the bounding box of this object, and the dimensions and colors of the smaller output grid. It also takes into consideration the color pattern of the outside rectangle.
