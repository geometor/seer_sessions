The input grids are larger and more complex, while the output grids are smaller and seem to represent a zoomed-out or simplified version of a specific colored object in the input. The core colors involved seem to vary across examples, but the general concept is consistent. It appears the other colors may be noise or irrelevant to the final result.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
