facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of colored pixels
    properties:
      - height
      - width
      - color_values (0-9)

  - type: object
    description: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
    - color
    - bounding_box:
        description: smallest rectangle enclosing all pixels of that color

  - type: transformation
    description: Reduction of input grid to a smaller output grid.
    actions:
      - identify_target_object: Find primary object of the output color, based on a repeating color pattern.
      - extract_bounding_box: Get bounding box of this object, ignoring other objects.
      - downsize: Reduce size of original grid to output grid.
      - select_pixels: Take only pixels that have colors of corners

  - type: relationship
    description: "Output is a downsized representation of the largest object's repeated pattern in the input"
