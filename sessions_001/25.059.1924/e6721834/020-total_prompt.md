"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. **Divide and Conquer:** Split the input grid vertically into two equal halves: a left half and a right half.
2. **Identify Right-Side Objects:** In the right half of the input grid, identify all distinct objects.  A distinct object is a group of contiguous pixels of the same color that are not the background color of the right half (azure/8).
3. **Reconstruct on Left Side:** Create an output grid that is the same size and shape as the *left* half of the input. For each object found in the *right* half, copy it to the *left* half. Maintain the row position, but place the colored pixel in the second to last column. If multiple object exist in a row, then overwrite.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of transferring information from the right half of the input grid to the left half. However, the initial program had errors, failing to accurately capture all the nuances of the transformation, particularly in handling different object colors, sizes, and positions within the right half.  It placed the objects in the second to last column when they should have all been placed in the last column. The strategy for error resolution is to incrementally refine the natural language program and code, focusing on accurately identifying and classifying objects and their colors and updating the placement logic.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Refine Object Identification:** The `get_objects` function seems robust, so we'll keep it.  We need to carefully verify its correctness, especially with respect to the background color, and its consistent application across all examples.
2. **Precise Color Mapping:**  The initial logic assumed a simple object-to-color mapping, which is not always sufficient based on the failing test.  We'll pay close attention to how colors are selected and transferred.
3. **Accurate Placement Logic:** The current logic overwrites pixels in the second to last column.  We need to analyze each example to determine the precise placement rules, which looks to be the *last* column.
4. **Iterative Testing and Refinement:** After each modification to the natural language program or code, we'll test against *all* available examples to ensure consistent behavior and identify any remaining issues.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of the example/results and a report:

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: 6d0a4769
    example_set: train
    general_rule: "Copy the last non-background pixel from each row of the right half to the last column of the left half."
    objects:
      - description: "Pixels in the right half of the grid, excluding those with the background color (8/azure)."
        properties:
          color: "Varies (1/blue, 2/red, 3/green, etc.)"
          shape: "Single pixel"
          position: "Relative to the right half of the grid"
    actions:
      - description: "Identify the rightmost non-background pixel in each row of the right half."
        details: "If a row contains multiple non-background pixels, only the rightmost one is considered.  If a row has no non-background pixels, no action is taken for that row."
      - description: "Copy the identified pixel's color to the corresponding row in the last column of the left half."
        details: "The left half's dimensions determine the output grid's size. The copied pixel's row position is maintained."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Split the input grid vertically into two equal halves: a left and a right half.
2.  **Identify Rightmost Non-Background Pixel:** For each row in the *right* half, find the rightmost pixel that *does not* have the background color (8/azure).
3.  **Copy to Left:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the *left* half of the input. For each row, copy the color of the identified rightmost non-background pixel (from step 2) to the *last* column of the output grid, maintaining the row position. If no non-background pixel was found in a row, leave the corresponding row in the output grid unchanged (all zeros).

This refined natural language program accounts for all the observations and addresses errors. It clarifies:

*   **Rightmost Pixel:** It emphasizes selecting only the *rightmost* non-background pixel.
*   **Last Column:** The copied pixel goes in the *last* column of the left half, not second to last.
*   **Empty Rows:** It explicitly states what happens if a row in the right half contains only the background color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
