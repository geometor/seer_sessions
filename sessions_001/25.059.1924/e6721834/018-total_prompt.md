Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the Region of Interest: Focus on the right half of the input grid (the azure (8) region).
2. Isolate Objects: Within the azure region, identify the distinct colored objects: the blue (1) object, the red (2) pixels, and the magenta (6) pixel.
3. Crop and Extract: Crop the input grid, discarding all columns starting at the vertical mid-point.
4. Remove all background pixels in the extracted section (azure pixels)
5. Reconstruct, maintaining the relative positions and colors. The final result is the cropped section containing the remaining object(s).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution on the training set and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and while it performed well on the examples, it doesn't fully capture the general rule. The core issue appears to be two fold. First is correctly cropping. Second is to properly identify and place only the objects from the *right* side of the input grid to the *left* side.

The strategy will be:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to object identification, movement, and any color/shape changes. Specifically look for a more precise way to describe the cropping method.
2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use `code_execution` to get precise information about object locations, sizes, and colors in both input and output grids. This will help quantify the transformations.
3.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current `get_objects` function seems sound, but we need to be absolutely sure it correctly separates distinct objects, even if they are adjacent. We should double-check the results of `get_objects`.
4.  **Precise Transformation Description:** Based on the analysis and metrics, update the natural language program with a more accurate and complete description of the transformation rule, addressing any observed discrepancies.

**Metrics Gathering and Example Analysis**

Let's use `code_execution` to gather information. I'll focus on key aspects like the bounding box of objects in input and related objects in the output.

```python
import numpy as np

def get_bounding_box(grid, color):
    rows, cols = np.where(grid == color)
    if len(rows) == 0:
        return None  # No object of that color
    min_row, max_row = np.min(rows), np.max(rows)
    min_col, max_col = np.min(cols), np.max(cols)
    return (min_row, min_col), (max_row, max_col)

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    print("Input grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Output grid:")
    print(output_grid)

    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    mid_col = cols // 2
    right_half = input_grid[:, mid_col:]
    left_half = input_grid[:, :mid_col]

    print(f"Input right half:\n{right_half}")
    print(f"Input left half:\n{left_half}")

    # Find and print bounding boxes for each color
    for color in np.unique(input_grid):
        input_bbox = get_bounding_box(input_grid, color)
        output_bbox = get_bounding_box(output_grid, color)

        print(f"Color {color}:")
        print(f"  Input Bounding Box: {input_bbox}")
        print(f"  Output Bounding Box: {output_bbox}")

    right_objects = get_objects(right_half, 8)
    left_objects = get_objects(left_half, 0) #assume background is white

    print(f"Objects in right half: {right_objects}")
    print(f"Objects in left half: {left_objects}")
    print("-" * 20)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
