The input grid contains colored regions (represented by digits 0-9) on a background (also a digit). The output grid seems to be a simplified or filtered version of the input, with some regions preserved and others removed. The background color in the output grid seems the same in both input and output. Key colors involved are azure (8), blue (1), red (2), green (3) and white(0). The input has two main regions of azure(8) and white(0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
