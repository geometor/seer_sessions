The input grid appears to be divided into two distinct regions: a left side dominated by yellow (4) and a right side dominated by azure (8). Within these regions, there are smaller, irregularly shaped objects of different colors (blue (1), red (2), and magenta (6)). The output grid seems to be a cropped and simplified version of the input grid, focusing on a specific area and potentially extracting or modifying certain objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
