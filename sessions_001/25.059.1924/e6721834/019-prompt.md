Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. **Divide and Conquer:** Split the input grid vertically into two equal halves: a left half and a right half.
2. **Identify Right-Side Objects:** In the right half of the input grid, identify all distinct objects.  A distinct object is a group of contiguous pixels of the same color that are not the background color of the right half (azure/8).
3. **Reconstruct on Left Side:** Create an output grid that is the same size and shape as the *left* half of the input. For each object found in the *right* half, copy it to the *left* half. Maintain the row position, but place the colored pixel in the second to last column. If multiple object exist in a row, then overwrite.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
