Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be divided into two main regions: a magenta (6) region on the left and a blue (1) region on the right. Within these regions, there are smaller, irregular shapes of different colors (green (3), azure (8), red (2)). The output grid seems to be a condensed or summarized version of the input, focusing primarily on the right-hand side (blue region) of the input grid. The left side appears to become all 1s.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      cells: [color_value]
  - type: region
    properties:
      color: [color_name]
      shape: [irregular]
      bounds: [top_left_row, top_left_col, bottom_right_row, bottom_right_col] #estimated
  - type: sub_region
    properties:
       color: [color_name]
       shape: [irregular]

actions:
  - type: condense
    description: Reduce the grid size, potentially by focusing on specific regions.
  - type: extract
    description: Select specific regions or features from the input grid.
  - type: recolor
    description: change colors on the left

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: [region, sub_region]
  - output_grid_represents: condensed(input_grid)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into two primary regions based on a vertical boundary. It looks to be around column 10. The left will be considered the magenta region, although other colors may be inside, and the right region will be the blue region.
2. **Focus on Blue Region:** Disregard/remove the section of the input left of the boundary.
3.  **Condense:** Project the remaining right side blue region of the input into a smaller grid.
4. Recolor left to 1s. The left region looks like it becomes solid 1s in all rows.
5. Preserve Colors: condense the input, but maintain all colors besides 6 to the right of the boundary, and setting all values left of the boundary to 1.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the right-hand side of the input, maintaining colors other than the background 6, condenses, and recolors the other side to the same color as the background on the right.
