            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the observation of 2x2 squares of non-zero colors being replaced by green 2x2 squares. While this holds true for the first example, subsequent examples reveal a flaw in this assumption. The generated code doesn't account for the condition of four *distinct* colors, which is a necessary constraint based on later examples. The code incorrectly identifies any 2x2 block composed by non-white squares.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The code needs to not just identify 2x2 squares of non-zero colors but specifically those with four *distinct* colors.\n2.  **Update Natural Language Program:** The description must clearly state the \"distinct colors\" constraint.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo verify the assumption of distinct colors, a deeper analysis of each example is needed, and I would like to print the 2x2 square, the distinct colors, and the output. Unfortunately I do not have access to the examples beyond the images.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_examples(task):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided examples and extracts relevant information about the transformations.\n\n    Specifically focuses on identifying 2x2 squares, counting distinct colors,\n    and verifying if a transformation to green occurs.\n    \"\"\"\n    results = []\n    for example in task['train']:\n        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])\n        \n        squares = find_2x2_squares(input_grid)\n\n        for i, j in squares:\n             # Extract the 2x2 square\n            square = input_grid[i:i+2, j:j+2]\n            # Count distinct colors\n            distinct_colors = len(np.unique(square))\n            # Check output grid\n            output_square = output_grid[i:i+2, j:j+2]\n            all_green = np.all(output_square == 3)\n\n            results.append(\n                {\n                \"example_index\": task['train'].index(example),\n                \"square_coords\": (i,j),\n                \"square_colors\": square.flatten().tolist(),\n                \"distinct_color_count\": distinct_colors,\n                \"output_is_all_green\": all_green\n                }\n            )\n\n    return results\n\n#Assuming task data is available, here is how to run analysis\n# task_data = load_task(\"path_to_task.json\") # Need an ARC loader function.\n# analysis_results = analyze_examples(task_data)\n\n#for result in analysis_results:\n#    print(result)\n```\n\nThe output from this would be essential in generating the YAML. Since\nI don't have access to the task file, I will make my best guess\nbased on the images.\n\nBased on a visual review of the provided images of the training examples, and the current program results here is a summary:\n\n*   **Example 0:** The initial observation holds. A 2x2 square with distinct colors is replaced by a green 2x2 square.\n*   **Example 1:** Two 2x2 areas with distinct colors. Both are turned green.\n*   **Example 2:** One area where there are four distinct colors, converted to green.\n*   **Example 3:** No 2x2 areas containing four distinct colors. No change.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: 2x2_square\n    properties:\n      - colors: [array of 4 colors]\n      - distinct_color_count: int  # Number of unique colors within the square\n    transformation:\n      - condition: distinct_color_count == 4\n        action: replace_with_green\n        details: All pixels in the 2x2 square are set to color 3 (green)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify 2x2 Squares:** Examine the input grid to locate all 2x2 squares.\n2.  **Check for Distinct Colors:** For each identified 2x2 square, determine the number of distinct colors present.\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:** If a 2x2 square contains exactly four distinct colors, replace the entire 2x2 square in the output grid with green (color value 3).\n4.  **Preserve Otherwise:** If a 2x2 square does not have four distinct colors, or if a location is not part of such, the output is a copy of the input.\n\n"
