Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all colored squares (1x1 squares) in the input grid.
2.  **Group Objects by Proximity**: Notice how some squares of various colors form separated two by two square clusters.
3.  **Fill Grouped Squares with Green:** The program identifies where the original 2x2 squares were. If a 2 by 2 square of four distinct colored squares is identified, replace each identified square with a 2x2 area filled in with color green (value 3).
"""

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
