  - observation: |
      The input grid contains multiple colored 2x2 squares, with colors including red (2), yellow(4), magenta(6), orange(7), maroon(9), and azure(8).
  - object_identification: |
      The 2x2 colored squares can be identified as discrete objects.
  - transformation_property_change:  |
      Some of the white space (0) is replaced with the color green(3), a solid 2x2 block, around and between the colored areas.
  - transformation_preservation: |
      The original 2x2 objects are not directly modified but are incorporated as boundaries, with green taking the place of white around them.
  - spatial_relationship: |
       the green areas connect original objects in the input.
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The output retains relative location of the colored objects to each other.
