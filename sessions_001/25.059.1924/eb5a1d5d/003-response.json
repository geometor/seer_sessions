The colors in the input grid seem to form nested rectangles. The output grid appears to represent a highly reduced and simplified version of the input, focusing on the central area and the colors present there. The outermost color (8 - azure) seems to frame the content, while the inner colors are green (3) and red (2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This might involve slight adjustments. If the central 5x5 area doesn't inherently include all relevant colors (8,3 and 2 from the center), prioritize including those colors in the output in the order of the location.\n\nEssentially, the output is a 5x5 \"thumbnail\" of the central region of the input grid, preserving the key colors and their relative positions.
