Inside, there's a nested structure: a large square of azure (8), within which is a smaller square of red (2), and finally, a single blue (1) pixel in the very center of the red square. The output is a much smaller grid (7x7) that seems to be a zoomed-in and cropped version of the central part of the input, retaining the nested structure of azure, red, and blue, but significantly reduced in size, and with the green border also reduced. The core structure appears to center around the blue (1) pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This serves as the anchor point.\n2.  **Define Inner Square:** Identify the red (2) square immediately surrounding the blue pixel.\n3. **Define Outer square:** Identify the larger azure (8) square.\n4.  **Crop and Zoom:** Create a new 7x7 grid.\n5.  **Reconstruct:**\n    *   Place the blue (1) pixel in the center of the new grid (4,4).\n    * The red square will take a 3x3 area around the central blue pixel.\n    * The azure square will be a 5x5 area, surrounding the red square.\n    *   Place azure (8) pixels adjacent to the central red square in all directions (above, below, left, and right) so the final shape is a 5 x 5 square\n    *   Fill the remaining outer border of the 7x7 grid with green (3) pixels.\n6. The final grid will be centered on the original single blue pixel position, resized to a 7x7 grid with a single blue pixel surrounded by nested red squares.\n\nIn short it is cropping the area based on a single pixel and resizing it to be a 7x7 grid.\n"
