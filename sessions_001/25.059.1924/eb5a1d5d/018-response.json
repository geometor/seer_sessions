            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code was built upon the observation of a single training example. It correctly identified the placement of nested squares (blue inside red inside azure) centered on a blue pixel, all within a green background. The expected outputs have only three colors: azure, blue and green. But predicted output has red pixels, too. All example output grids are 7x7. However, It's clear from running the code against all examples that this rule is incomplete or has incorrect details. It identifies the blue pixel, and creates the nested squares, but doesn't account for cases where this process might go out of bounds (which is okay, because numpy handles that), but the order of the fills isn't correct, leading to red pixels when azure should overwrite them.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors**\n\n1.  **Verify Assumptions:** The code assumes a single blue pixel as the anchor point. We need to re-confirm whether all inputs *always* have one and only one blue pixel.\n2.  **Correct fill order:** Ensure the azure square overwrites the red square.\n3.  **Output Size:** output is always 7x7.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of observations from comparing each `input_grid`, predicted `transform(input_grid)` results, and the provided `expected_output` for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Has a single blue pixel.\n    *   Predicted Output: Correct size (7x7). Correct blue at center. Incorrect red pixels around blue.\n    *   Expected Output:  7x7, all green except for a central 3x3 azure square with a blue pixel in the very center.\n    *   Match:  **False**.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Has a single blue pixel.\n    *   Predicted Output: Correct size (7x7). Correct blue at center. Incorrect red pixels around blue.\n    *   Expected Output: 7x7, all green except for a central 3x3 azure square with a blue pixel in the very center.\n    *   Match:  **False**.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Has a single blue pixel.\n    *   Predicted Output: Correct size (7x7). Correct blue at center. Incorrect red pixels around blue.\n    *   Expected Output: 7x7, all green except for a central 3x3 azure square with a blue pixel in the very center.\n    *   Match:  **False**.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: Has a single blue pixel.\n    *   Predicted Output: Correct size (7x7). Correct blue at center. Incorrect red pixels around blue.\n    *   Expected Output: 7x7, all green except for a central 3x3 azure square with a blue pixel in the very center.\n    *   Match:  **False**.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      All input grids contain exactly one blue pixel.\n  - observation: |\n      All output grids are 7x7.\n  - observation: |\n      All output grids have a green background (color 3).\n  - observation: |\n      All output grids contain a single blue pixel (color 1) at their center (3,3).\n  - observation: |\n      All output grids contain a 3x3 azure square (color 8) centered on the blue pixel.\n  - observation: |\n     The red square suggested by the first example is not present in the solution.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find the Blue Pixel:** Locate the single blue pixel (color 1) within the input grid.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 7x7 output grid filled with green (color 3).\n3.  **Center Blue Pixel:** Place a blue pixel (color 1) at the center of the output grid (coordinates 3, 3).\n4.  **Create Azure Square:** Create a 3x3 azure square (color 8) centered on the blue pixel in the output grid. This square will overwrite any other colors within its bounds.\n\nThe key improvements here are: explicit 7x7 output, and using only a 3x3 azure box centered on the single blue pixel, eliminating the incorrectly inferred red square.\n"
