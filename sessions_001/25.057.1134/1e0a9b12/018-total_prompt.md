Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Pixels:** Examine each non-zero pixel in the input grid.
2. **Check for Movability:** For each pixel, determine if it can move down. A pixel can move down *only if* the cell directly below it is either:
   - Empty (value 0).
   - Occupied by a non-zero pixel (of any color), AND the pixel below is not part of the same 'original' cluster as the pixel being checked.
3. **Move Down:** If a pixel is movable, move it down *as far as possible* until:
    -It hits another pixel of any color.
    -It reaches the bottom row.
4. **Merge:** If a pixel moves down and becomes adjacent to another non-zero pixel, consider them merged into a single cluster (this is implicit in the positioning).
5.  **Fill empty spaces:** If a space is not occupied, fill it with zero.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a "gravity" concept, where colored pixels fall down until they hit another pixel or the bottom. The code attempts to handle cluster merging and differentiate between clusters. However, the test results show discrepancies, indicating that the logic isn't entirely correct, especially in how it handles interactions *between* different colored clusters. The primary issue appears to be that pixels in original clusters can move, but pixels in dropped clusters shouldn't move again.

The strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze Results:** Examine each example pair (input, expected output, actual output) to identify the specific cases where the code fails. I'll pay close attention to how different colored blocks interact.
2.  **Metrics and Reports:** I'll use code execution to compare the expected and actual outputs, highlighting the differences in pixel positions. This will help pinpoint where the current logic is flawed.
3.  **Refine Facts and Program:** Based on the analysis, I will update the YAML facts to reflect the corrected object behaviors and interactions. Then, I'll rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation.  Crucially, I'll need to clearly define how "falling" and "merging" work and under what conditions pixels *stop* moving. The concept of original clusters might not fully capture what's happening - there might be some rule regarding when moved clusters are allowed to move again.

**Metrics and Reports (Code Execution)**

import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """
    Compares two grids and returns a report of differences.
    """
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Grids have different shapes."

    diff = grid1 != grid2
    num_diffs = np.sum(diff)
    diff_indices = np.where(diff)

    report = f"Number of differing pixels: {num_diffs}\n"
    for i in range(num_diffs):
        r, c = diff_indices[0][i], diff_indices[1][i]
        report += f"  Pixel at ({r}, {c}): Expected {grid1[r, c]}, Got {grid2[r, c]}\n"
    return report

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
