objects:
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All possible colors
      position: (row, column)
      is_movable: boolean  # Determined by presence of empty or occupied space below

actions:
  - name: move_down
    preconditions:
      - target: pixel
      - condition: >
          The space directly below the pixel is either empty (0) OR
          the space directly below is occupied by a pixel of *any* color, AND
          the pixel below is not part of the current pixel's original cluster.

    postconditions:
      - target: pixel
      - effect: pixel's row index increases by the maximum possible amount, until blocked.

  - name: merge
    preconditions:
      - target: two pixels of any color
      - condition: the pixels are vertically adjacent after a move_down action.
    postconditions:
      - target: merged pixel cluster
      - effect: the two pixels are now considered part of the same cluster.
