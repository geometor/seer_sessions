Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify all non-zero elements in the input grid.
2. Collect these non-zero values.
3. Place these collected values, in order of their original appearance in the input (reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom), into the last row of the output grid, starting from the bottom-leftmost cell.
4. Fill all other cells in the output grid with zeros (white).

    # Initialize output grid with zeros, same size as input
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Collect non-zero elements

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
