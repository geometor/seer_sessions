            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program focused on rearranging non-zero pixels from the last column of the input to the last column of the output, preserving their bottom-to-top order. While this worked for the first training example, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern. The transformation isn't limited to the last column; it appears to involve identifying the *right-most* non-zero pixels in *each row* and potentially moving or replicating them. The provided code fails because it only takes non-zero from the last column.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  Analyze each input-output pair, focusing on *all* non-zero pixels, not just those in the last column.\n2.  Identify a consistent rule that explains how the right-most non-zero pixels in each row of the input relate to the corresponding row in the output.\n3.  Use observations to update facts and natural language program.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo accurately analyze the examples, I will not be using `code_execution`. The errors are not in execution, they are in concept. I will focus on manual inspection for patterns.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Already analyzed, code works as expected)\n    Input shape: (3, 5)\n    Output Shape: (3, 5)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    Input shape: (3, 7)\n    Output shape: (3, 7)\n\n    ```\n    Input:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]\n\n    Expected Output:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]\n\n    Actual Output:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n    ```\n    Error: The '1' in the last row was not moved to the last column, because it was originally second to last.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    Input shape: (5, 5)\n    Output shape: (5, 5)\n\n    ```\n    Input:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 2, 0],\n     [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n    Expected Output:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]\n\n    Actual Output:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n     Error: All '2' values should be moved to the final column.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: (3, 5)\n      output_shape: (3, 5)\n      rule: \"The last non-zero pixel in each row of the input grid is moved to the last column of the output grid in the corresponding row.\"\n      objects:\n        - type: \"pixel\"\n          properties: [color, position]\n          actions: [move]\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: (3, 7)\n      output_shape: (3, 7)\n      rule: \"The last non-zero pixel in each row of the input grid is moved to the last column of the output grid in the corresponding row.\"\n      objects:\n        - type: \"pixel\"\n          properties: [color, position]\n          actions: [move]\n  - example_3:\n      input_shape: (5, 5)\n      output_shape: (5, 5)\n      rule: \"The last non-zero pixel in each row of the input grid is moved to the last column of the output grid in the corresponding row.\"\n      objects:\n        - type: \"pixel\"\n          properties: [color, position]\n          actions: [move]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.\n2.  For each row, **find** the right-most non-zero pixel.\n3.  In the corresponding row of the output grid, **set** the last cell (right-most) to the value of the pixel found in step 2.\n4.  If a row contains all zeros, keep the same row in output grid (all zeros).\n\nIn short: The last non-zero pixel in each row of the input grid is moved to the last column of the output grid in the corresponding row.\n"
