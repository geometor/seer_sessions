facts:
  - observation: |
      Non-zero elements from the input grid are extracted and placed in the output grid.
  - object: |
      Non-zero elements are treated as individual objects.
  - property: |
      The relative positions of non-zero elements are preserved during the transformation.  If we draw a bounding box around all non-zero elements in the input, that same bounding box, moved, will contain those same elements in the output.
  - action: |
      The non-zero values are extracted in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).
  - action: |
      Extracted elements maintain input spatial relationships.
  - constraint: |
     The output dimensions may be the same as or different than the input.
