The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. Most cells are white (0), but some contain other colors. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the non-zero elements. The output grid has a different structure for the non-zero elements compared to the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
