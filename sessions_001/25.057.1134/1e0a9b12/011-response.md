Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program focused on rearranging non-zero pixels from the last column of the input to the last column of the output, preserving their bottom-to-top order. While this worked for the first training example, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern. The transformation isn't limited to the last column; it appears to involve identifying the *right-most* non-zero pixels in *each row* and potentially moving or replicating them. The provided code fails because it only takes non-zero from the last column.

The strategy will be to:

1.  Analyze each input-output pair, focusing on *all* non-zero pixels, not just those in the last column.
2.  Identify a consistent rule that explains how the right-most non-zero pixels in each row of the input relate to the corresponding row in the output.
3.  Use observations to update facts and natural language program.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately analyze the examples, I will not be using `code_execution`. The errors are not in execution, they are in concept. I will focus on manual inspection for patterns.

*   **Example 1:** (Already analyzed, code works as expected)
    Input shape: (3, 5)
    Output Shape: (3, 5)

*   **Example 2:**
    Input shape: (3, 7)
    Output shape: (3, 7)

    ```
    Input:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]

    Expected Output:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]

    Actual Output:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

    ```
    Error: The '1' in the last row was not moved to the last column, because it was originally second to last.

*   **Example 3:**
    Input shape: (5, 5)
    Output shape: (5, 5)

    ```
    Input:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
     [0, 0, 0, 2, 0],
     [0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0]]

    Expected Output:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]]

    Actual Output:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
     Error: All '2' values should be moved to the final column.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: (3, 5)
      output_shape: (3, 5)
      rule: "The last non-zero pixel in each row of the input grid is moved to the last column of the output grid in the corresponding row."
      objects:
        - type: "pixel"
          properties: [color, position]
          actions: [move]
  - example_2:
      input_shape: (3, 7)
      output_shape: (3, 7)
      rule: "The last non-zero pixel in each row of the input grid is moved to the last column of the output grid in the corresponding row."
      objects:
        - type: "pixel"
          properties: [color, position]
          actions: [move]
  - example_3:
      input_shape: (5, 5)
      output_shape: (5, 5)
      rule: "The last non-zero pixel in each row of the input grid is moved to the last column of the output grid in the corresponding row."
      objects:
        - type: "pixel"
          properties: [color, position]
          actions: [move]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  For each row, **find** the right-most non-zero pixel.
3.  In the corresponding row of the output grid, **set** the last cell (right-most) to the value of the pixel found in step 2.
4.  If a row contains all zeros, keep the same row in output grid (all zeros).

In short: The last non-zero pixel in each row of the input grid is moved to the last column of the output grid in the corresponding row.
