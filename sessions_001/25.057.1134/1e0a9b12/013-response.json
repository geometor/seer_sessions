The colors change from input to output, and some colors are not present in both. The shape and size of the grid is consistent. There appears to be a relationship between spatially adjacent, non-zero pixels. The key seems to be the movement, addition, and modification of colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
