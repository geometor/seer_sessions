  - observation: color_change
    description: Some pixel colors change between input and output.
    details: >

      in the order Blue, Red, Green, then Magenta, at the bottom of the grid.
  - observation: spatial_relationship
    description:  Non-zero pixels move down.
  - observation: color_priority
    description: There appears to be a priority between color when they combine in the output, Blue > Red > Green > Magenta.
