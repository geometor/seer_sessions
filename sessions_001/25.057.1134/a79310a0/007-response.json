The input grid contains a single non-zero pixel (value 8, color azure) at position (0, 1), with all other pixels being zero (white). The output grid mirrors the input grid's dimensions, but the non-zero pixel has changed its value to 2 (color red) and is now located at the center (1, 1). All other values remain the same. The core transformation seems to involve changing a single azure pixel to red, and there's also possibly a relocation to the grid's center.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
