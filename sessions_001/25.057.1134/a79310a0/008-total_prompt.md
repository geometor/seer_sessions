## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 8 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CC7D8D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9C7750>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a single non-zero pixel (value 8, color azure) at position (0, 1), with all other pixels being zero (white). The output grid mirrors the input grid's dimensions, but the non-zero pixel has changed its value to 2 (color red) and is now located at the center (1, 1). All other values remain the same. The core transformation seems to involve changing a single azure pixel to red, and there's also possibly a relocation to the grid's center.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - subject: grid
    description: 3x3 grid of pixels
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cell_values: integers 0-9

  - subject: input_grid
    relation: contains
    object: pixel_1
    properties: {}

  - subject: pixel_1
    description: a non-zero pixel
    properties:
      initial_value: 8
      initial_color: azure
      initial_position: (0, 1)

  - subject: output_grid
    relation: contains
    object: pixel_2
    properties: {}

  - subject: pixel_2
      description: a non-zero pixel
      properties:
        final_value: 2
        final_color: red
        final_position: (1, 1)

  - subject: other_pixels
    description: all zero value pixels
    properties:
      value: 0
      color: white
      positions: remain constant

  - subject: transformation
    description: single pixel value and color change.
    actions:
      - change value of pixel from 8 to 2.
      - change color from azure to red.
      - move pixel to the center, if not already there.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the single non-zero pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Change** the value of this pixel to 2 (red).
3.  **Move** this pixel to the center of the grid at coordinates (1,1).
4. **Preserve** the rest of the pixels (value 0 and white) in their orginal positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
