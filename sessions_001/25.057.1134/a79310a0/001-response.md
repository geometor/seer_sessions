Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another grid of the same dimensions. The primary change appears to be a color swap between specific regions. A 2x2 square of azure (8) pixels in the input becomes a 2x2 square of red (2) pixels in the output. The position of this 2x2 square is shifted down one row. The rest of the grid, which is filled with white (0) pixels, remains unchanged.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: square_1
    type: shape
    shape_type: square
    dimensions: 2x2
    color_input: azure (8)
    color_output: red (2)
    position_input: (0,0) # top-left corner
    position_output: (1,0) #top-left corner
  - action: color_swap
    source: square_1, input
    target: square_1, output
  - action: move_down
    object: square_1
    distance: 1 row
  - relation: grid_size_constant
    description: input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - relation: background_constant
    description: all pixels outside of the identified square remain with a value of 0
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** a 2x2 square of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Locate** the position of this 2x2 square.
3.  **Create** an output grid identical to the input grid.
4. **Move** one row down from square from the original position.
5.  **Change** the color of the 2x2 square in the new position in the output grid to red (2).
6.  **Keep** all other pixels in the output grid the same as the input grid (white/0).
