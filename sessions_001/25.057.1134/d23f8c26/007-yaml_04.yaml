facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    dimensions: 5x5
    values: integers representing colors (0-9)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: represented by an integer (0-9)
      position: row and column index within the grid
  - observation: central_column_selection
    description: Only the pixels in the center column of the input are potentially relevant.
  - observation: non_white_filtering
    description: Only non-white (non-zero) pixels from the input's central column are kept.
  - observation: position_shift
    description: Selected pixels maintain their original row index.
    new_column: All selected pixels are moved to the center column in the output grid.
  - observation: color_preservation
    description: selected pixels maintain their original color.
