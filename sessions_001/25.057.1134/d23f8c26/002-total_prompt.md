## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 4 0
0 3 9
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB80BD0>

**output:**
```
0 4 0
0 3 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB81150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation appears to involve retaining certain colors while changing others to white (0). The spatial arrangement of the retained colors seems important, indicating a position-based rule rather than a simple color substitution. Specifically, the colors in the top-middle and center positions are preserved. All of the other colors become white.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Process:** Iterate through each pixel in the grid.
3.  **Conditional Check:** For each pixel, check its position (row, column).
4.  **Preservation:** If the pixel is located at position (0, 1) which is the top-middle, or (1, 1) which is the center, retain its original color.
5.  **Transformation:** If the pixel is *not* at position (0,1) or (1,1), set its color to 0 (white).
6.  **Output:** The modified 3x3 grid with only the specified positions retaining their color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
