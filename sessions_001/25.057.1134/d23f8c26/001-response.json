Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation appears to involve retaining certain colors while changing others to white (0). The spatial arrangement of the retained colors seems important, indicating a position-based rule rather than a simple color substitution. Specifically, the colors in the top-middle and center positions are preserved. All of the other colors become white.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
