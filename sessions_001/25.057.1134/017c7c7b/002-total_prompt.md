## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 1
0 1 0
1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x74AF1CE102D0>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
2 2 0
0 2 0
0 2 2
0 2 0
2 2 0
0 2 0
0 2 2
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x74AF1CE107D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 6x3 grid. The grid contains two colors: white (0) and blue (1). There's a vertical blue line in the center column.
*   **Output:** A 9x3 grid (50% taller). The grid contains two colors: white (0) and red (2). There's a vertical red line in the center column, and two additional output rows containing the value 2.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x3
      colors: [0, 1]  # white, blue
      elements:
        - type: line
          orientation: vertical
          color: 1 # blue
          position: center column

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x3
      colors: [0, 2]  # white, red
      elements:
          - type: line
            orientation: vertical
            color: 2 #red
            position: center column
transformation:
    type: color_change and add_rows
    input_color: 1 #blue
    output_color: 2 #red
    added_rows: 3

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid, which will always occupy the center column.
2.  **Transform:** Change the color of all the blue (1) pixels in this line to red (2).
3. **Extend:** add three rows to the bottom of the grid.
4. **Fill:** set the value of the cells corresponding to the location of the identified line, to the color red (2).

Essentially all blue pixels are changed to red, and the output grid is 50% taller.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
