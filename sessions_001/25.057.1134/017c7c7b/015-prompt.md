Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation takes a grid with a blue line, changes the blue line to red, and adds three rows at the bottom of the grid which continues the pattern - white, white, red, red.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid by copying the input grid and changing the datatype to allow modification.
    output_grid = input_grid.astype(int)
    
    # Find the blue pixels (value 1) and change them to red (value 2) in the output grid.
    output_grid[output_grid == 1] = 2

    # Get dimensions of the original input grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Create a new array of zeros with extra rows
    added_rows = np.zeros((3, cols), dtype=int)

    #Set pattern of the added rows.
    added_rows[0, :] = 0 # white
    added_rows[1, 1] = 2 #red
    added_rows[2, 1] = 2 #red

    # Concatenate the original grid with added rows using vstack
    output_grid = np.vstack((output_grid, added_rows))    

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
