Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves replacing all blue (1) pixels with red (2) pixels in a checkerboard pattern and increasing the height of the grid by adding three rows that continue the checkerboard pattern.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Replace all blue (1) pixels with red (2)
    output_grid[output_grid == 1] = 2
    
    # Get dimensions of original grid
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape
    
    # Create the extension rows as numpy array.  The existing output_grid establishes
    # the checkerboard pattern, so just duplicate a slice.
    extension = np.copy(output_grid[0:3,:])
    
    # Vertically stack to add to bottom
    output_grid = np.vstack((output_grid, extension))

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
