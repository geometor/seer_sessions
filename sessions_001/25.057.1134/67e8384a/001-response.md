Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be a 3x3 matrix of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The output grid is a 6x6 matrix, also of single-digit integers/colors. The output seems to be a symmetrical expansion or mirroring of the input grid, both horizontally and vertically. The core pattern from the input is preserved and repeated.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - relationship: expansion
    from: input grid
    to: output grid
    type: symmetrical mirroring
    axes: horizontal and vertical
  - objects:
      name: input_pixel
      properties: color, location (row,col)
  - actions:
      name: mirroring_row
      description: takes row of pixels and mirrors it
      example: "5 3 4" becomes "5 3 4 4 3 5"
  - actions:
      name: mirroring_col
      description: takes column of pixels and mirrors it
      example:
          input:
              - 5
              - 3
              - 3
          output:
              - 5
              - 3
              - 3
              - 3
              - 3
              - 5

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Mirror Rows:** For each row in the input grid, create a mirrored row in the output grid. Mirroring means appending the reversed sequence of the original row to itself (excluding the last element of the original if row length is odd, the complete row reversed if row length is even. E.g., "5 3 4" becomes "5 3 4 4 3 5"). Place these mirrored rows sequentially in the output.

2. **Mirror Columns:** The entire set of mirrored rows created in step 1 is then mirrored vertically. This means appending the reversed sequence of mirrored rows to the existing mirrored rows to complete the output. The original row is appended reversed and excludes the last element to handle odd sized results.

In simpler terms: The input grid is expanded by mirroring each row and then mirroring the resulting block of rows vertically.
