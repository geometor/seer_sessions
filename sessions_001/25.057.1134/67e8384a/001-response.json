The input grid appears to be a 3x3 matrix of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The output grid is a 6x6 matrix, also of single-digit integers/colors. The output seems to be a symmetrical expansion or mirroring of the input grid, both horizontally and vertically. The core pattern from the input is preserved and repeated.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Mirroring means appending the reversed sequence of the original row to itself (excluding the last element of the original if row length is odd, the complete row reversed if row length is even. E.g., \"5 3 4\" becomes \"5 3 4 4 3 5\"). Place these mirrored rows sequentially in the output.\n\n2. **Mirror Columns:** The entire set of mirrored rows created in step 1 is then mirrored vertically. This means appending the reversed sequence of mirrored rows to the existing mirrored rows to complete the output. The original row is appended reversed and excludes the last element to handle odd sized results.\n\nIn simpler terms: The input grid is expanded by mirroring each row and then mirroring the resulting block of rows vertically.\n"
