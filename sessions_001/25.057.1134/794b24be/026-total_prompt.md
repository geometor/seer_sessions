## Example 5

**input:**
```
0 0 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1D0BAED0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9B14D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains a single blue pixel (value 1) in the top-right corner, with the rest being white pixels (value 0). The output grid has a single red pixel (value 2) in the top-left corner, with the remaining pixels being white (value 0). The transformation seems to involve a change in both the color and position of the single non-zero pixel.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid has a single blue pixel (1) at position (0, 2).
  - observation: Output grid has a single red pixel (2) at position (0, 0).
  - observation: All other pixels in both grids are white (0).
  - relationship: The non-zero pixel's color changes from blue (1) to red (2).
  - relationship: The non-zero pixel's position changes from top-right to top-left.
  - object: non_zero_pixel:
      properties:
        color:
            input: 1
            output: 2
        position:
          input: [0,2]
          output: [0,0]
  - action: change_color:
        from: 1
        to: 2

  - action: change_position:
        from: [0,2]
        to: [0,0]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-zero pixel in the input grid.
2.  Change the color of this pixel from blue (1) to red (2).
3.  Move the pixel from its original location to the top-left corner of the grid (position 0, 0).
4.  All the other pixels are zero

Or more succinctly:

Locate the colored pixel in the input. Change its color to red (2) and move it to the top-left corner of the grid. Ensure all other pixels are white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
