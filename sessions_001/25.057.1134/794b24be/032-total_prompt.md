## Example 6

**input:**
```
1 1 0
0 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C88FE50>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CC2F6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid replaces the blue pixels with red (2) pixels, while the white pixels remain unchanged. The grid dimensions and the positions of the white pixels are preserved. It appears to be a simple color substitution.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - contains_pixels: [0, 1]  # Input grid
      - contains_pixels: [0, 2]  # Output grid

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          input: [white, blue]
          output: [white, red]
      - value:
          input: [0, 1]
          output: [0, 2]
    
actions:
  - type: color_substitution
    description: Replace blue pixels with red pixels.
    input_color: blue (1)
    output_color: red (2)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixel positions are maintained. The grid structure is unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  If a pixel's value is 1 (blue), change it to 2 (red).
3.  If a pixel's value is 0 (white) keep the pixel's value to 0.
4.  Output the modified grid, preserving the original dimensions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
