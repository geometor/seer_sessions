"""
1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is the same size and shape as the input grid, and initially filled with 0 (white).
2.  **Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  **Condition Check:** For each row in the input, check if *any* of its pixels are either blue (1) or white (0).
4.  **Transformation based on the row condition:**
    *   If a row contains *at least one* blue (1) or white (0) pixel, change *all* pixels in the *corresponding* row of the output grid to red (2).
    *   If a row in the input does not contain any 1 or 0, then the entire corresponding row in the output should be unchanged.
5.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of these row-by-row transformations.
