The input grid contains pixels of color white (0) and blue (1). The output grid contains pixels of color white (0) and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a color change based on specific criteria. The core concept is replacing certain colors based on their initial value.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
