## Example 10

**input:**
```
1 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C88ED50>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CA46AD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid contains red (2) and white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to be related to the presence and position of blue pixels in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Input grid contains pixels of colors blue (1) and white (0).
  - observation: Output grid contains pixels of colors red (2) and white (0).
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cell_values: [0, 1, 2]
  - action: Transformation
    input: Grid
    output: Grid
    description: Replaces certain input pixels with output pixels based on a rule.
  - relationship:  Blue pixels in the input seem to correspond to Red pixels in the output
  - relationship:  The positions of red pixels is the same as that of the top most blue pixel row.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the top-most row in the input grid that contains at least one blue pixel.
2.  **Replace** all the cells in that row on output grid with red pixels.
3. **Fill** rest of the pixels in the output grid to white.

In essence, the program finds the highest row with any blue pixels and converts that entire row to red in the output, while ensuring all other pixels are set to white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
