## Example 8

**input:**
```
1 1 0
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB80BD0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1D0BAED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains values of 0 and 1, representing white and blue pixels, respectively. The output grid contains values of 0 and 2, representing white and red pixels. The transformation appears to involve replacing certain colors based on their neighbors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            1: blue
            2: red

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: individual pixel color (white, blue, or red)
      - position: (row, column) within the grid

actions:
  - type: color_change
    description: Change pixel color based on a certain rule

relationships:
 - type: adjacency
   description: relationship is how the colors of neighboring pixels determine if a pixel will change color.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check neighbors**. Examine the colors in the input grid.
    *   If the pixel is blue (1) and any horizontally or vertically adjacent pixel is also blue (1), change the pixel's color to red (2) in the output grid. If the current pixel has no blue neighbors it is not changed.
    *   If all of a blue pixel's neighbors are white, it remains blue.
3.  **Copy Unchanged**: If a pixel is white (0) in the input grid, it remains white (0) in the output grid.
4. **Top Row**: Copy only the top row if the left most, middle and right most pixels are all blue.
5. **Middle Row**: If the center pixel is white with a blue pixel to its left, it changes to red.
6. **Bottom Row**: If bottom left and right corner pixels are blue, they are changed to white.

In summary input pixels are only changed if they are blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
