            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the initial code to develop a refined natural language program and identify the transformation rule.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code only focuses on determining the dimensions of the input and output grids. This is insufficient to capture the actual transformation logic. The examples clearly show a relationship between the position of the blue (1) pixel in the input and a red (2) pixel in the output. It seems like the blue pixel's location dictates where the red pixel will appear, but with some kind of offset or transformation of the coordinates. We need to identify this offset rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Pixel Positions:** For each example, precisely determine the coordinates of the blue pixel in the input and the red pixel in the output.\n2.  **Identify the Relationship:** Calculate the difference in row and column indices between the input blue pixel and the output red pixel. Look for a consistent pattern in these differences.\n3.  **Formulate a Rule:** Based on the pattern, develop a natural language program describing how the input is transformed into the output, focusing on the relationship between the blue and red pixels.\n4. **Document**: create a YAML block with clear and concise facts\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using assumed code execution):**\n\nLet's represent pixel coordinates as (row, column), starting from (0, 0) in the top-left corner.\n\n| Example | Input Blue (1) Pixel | Output Red (2) Pixel | Row Difference | Column Difference |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| 1       | (1, 1)               | (1, 2)               | 0              | 1                 |\n| 2       | (1, 1)               | (1, 1)               | 0              | 0                 |\n| 3       | (2, 0)               | (2, 3)               | 0              | 3                 |\n| 4       | (0, 1)               | (0, 2)               | 0              | 1                 |\n| 5       | (2, 3)               | (2, 0)               | 0              | -3                |\n\n**Observations from Metrics:**\n\n-   The row index of the red pixel in the output is *always* the same as the row index of the blue pixel in the input.\n-   The column index of the red pixel in the output is *related* to the column index of the blue pixel in the input, but the relationship is NOT consistent addition or subtraction.\n- Looking at example 5, when a -3 is shown, it is modulus the width of the input.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      Each input grid contains at most one blue (1) pixel.\n  - observation: |\n      Each output grid contains at most one red (2) pixel.\n  - observation: |\n      The row index of the red pixel in the output is the same as the row index of the blue pixel in the input.\n  - observation: |\n      The column of the output is related to the column of the input\n  - action: |\n      If a blue pixel is present in input:\n         replace it with color black (0)\n         place a red (2) pixel, wrapping the index at the grid width\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Start with an output grid that is identical to the input grid.\n2.  **Find Blue:** Scan the input grid to find the location of the blue (1) pixel. If no blue pixel is found, the output is all black (0).\n3.  **Place Red:** If a blue pixel is found at coordinates (row, col):\n    - change the value at (row, col) to black (0)\n    - compute the output column index: `output_col = (input_col + x) % input_width` where `x` is calculated by code and `%` is modulus operator.\n    - change the pixel in the output grid at (row, `output_col`) to red (2).\n4. If no blue pixel is found, return all black.\n\n**Next Steps for Coder:**\n\nThe coder should implement the logic described above. The critical part will be handling the wrap at grid width.\n"
