1. Check for Blue: Examine the entire input grid. If any pixel is blue (1), proceed to step 2. Otherwise, the output is identical with the input.
2. Transform First Row: If blue is present, change all pixels in the *first* row of the output grid to red (2).
3. Keep remaining rows unchanged: The remaining rows in the output grid are the same as the input grid if blue is not present, and all 0 if the first row has been modified..
