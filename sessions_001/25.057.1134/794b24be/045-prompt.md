Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
Check neighbors. Examine the colors in the input grid.
    If the pixel is blue (1) and any horizontally or vertically adjacent pixel is also blue (1), change the pixel's color to red (2) in the output grid. If the current pixel has no blue neighbors it is not changed.
    If all of a blue pixel's neighbors are white, it remains blue.
Copy Unchanged: If a pixel is white (0) in the input grid, it remains white (0) in the output grid.
Top Row: Copy only the top row if the left most, middle and right most pixels are all blue.
Middle Row: If the center pixel is white with a blue pixel to its left, it changes to red.
Bottom Row: If bottom left and right corner pixels are blue, they are changed to white.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
