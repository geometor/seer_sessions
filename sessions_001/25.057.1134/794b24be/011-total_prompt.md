Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialization:** Start with a copy of the input grid as the output grid.

2.  **First Row Transformation:** Identify all blue pixels (value 1) in the first row of the input grid. Change these pixels to red (value 2) in the output grid.

3.  **Iterative Propagation:**
    *   Create an empty list, `changed_pixels`
    *   Iteratively, until no more changes occur:
        *   Add the coordinates of each pixel changed to red to a list called `changed_pixels`
        *    For each changed pixel in `changed_pixels`:
                Find all neighboring pixels (orthogonal and diagonal).
            *   If a neighbor is blue in the input grid, change it to red in the output grid and add its coordinates to `changed_pixels`.
        *   Clear the `changed_pixels` list after each iteration

4.  **Final Output:** The output grid now represents the transformed image. All other pixels remain their original color.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
