The input grid contains a single blue pixel (value 1) in the top-right corner, with the rest being white pixels (value 0). The output grid has a single red pixel (value 2) in the top-left corner, with the remaining pixels being white (value 0). The transformation seems to involve a change in both the color and position of the single non-zero pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
