Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output image doubles the input and adds a border.
1. Border Creation: Create a new, empty grid that is twice the size of the original input grid (if input is NxN, output is 2Nx2N). 
   Copy the values of the outer edges of the input grid to create a border on the outside of the output grid.
2. Center Expansion: For each pixel *not* on the edge of the *input* grid, create a 2x2 block of pixels with the same color in the *output* grid. 
   Each of original pixel maps to a 2 x 2 square of the same color. The mapping occurs at index * 2 of the original. 
   That is, an input pixel at `(i,j)` maps to the top-left corner of its expansion at output index `(i*2, j*2)`.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
