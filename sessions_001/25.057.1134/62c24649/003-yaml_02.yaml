task_id: 3ed85e60
observations:
  - object_types:
      - grid: The fundamental object, a 2D array of pixels.
      - pixel: An individual cell within the grid, represented by a color.
      - border: The outer edge of the grid.
      - center: The inner part of the grid, excluding the border.
      - expanded_pixel: A 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid, corresponding to a single pixel in the input grid's center.
  - properties:
      - grid_size: Input grid dimensions (rows, cols). Output grid dimensions (2*rows, 2*cols).
      - color: The value of a pixel (0-9), representing a specific color.
  - actions:
      - expand: Replicate a pixel from the input's center to a 2x2 block in the output.
      - copy: copy the border of input
      - reflect:  reflect a segment of a row across input grid, and use the reflection to fill the remaining section of the row of output grid
  - constraints:
      - size_doubling: The output grid is always twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
      - border_preservation:  Border values are taken from Input
  - errors:
      - example_1: "perfect match"
      - example_2: "mismatched border pixels"
      - example_3: "mismatched border pixels"
