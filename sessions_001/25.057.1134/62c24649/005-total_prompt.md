Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program (which isn't explicitly stated, but we know generated the `transform` function) clearly captured some aspect of the transformation related to expanding the input grid. However, the varying degrees of success across the examples indicate that it's not the complete picture. The first example got perfect match (probably because it was used to developed the initial 'transform' function, the second has a very low match score, and the third is in between. This suggests the initial rule was overfit to the first training example and needs to be generalized. We need to determine what distinguishes a successful expansion from an unsuccessful one, and what rules govern the placement of the original input pixels within the expanded output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll examine the provided input/output pairs and the diffs to understand precisely *where* the generated output deviates from the expected output. This involves looking at the colors and positions of differing pixels.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll refine the initial hypothesis about the transformation, likely adding conditions or constraints.
3.  **Natural Language Program Update:** The natural language program will be updated to reflect the refined hypothesis, describing a more general and accurate transformation rule.
4.  I am going to avoid hardcoding rules based on a single example.

**Metrics and Observations (using provided `results`):**
I am assuming the current transform function duplicates input grid.

*   **Example 0:**
    *   Match Score: 1.0
    *   Diff: All `False` (perfect match)
    *   Observation: The initial program perfectly predicts this example. Confirms the initial, though incomplete, assumption.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Match Score: 0.166
    *   Diff: `[[False False False  True  True  True]
 [False  True  True  True  True False]
 [False  True  True  True  True False]
 [ True  True  True False False False]
 [False  True  True  True  True False]
 [False False False  True  True  True]]`
    *   Observation: Very poor match. The output has the "outline" correct, but the interior filling is completely wrong, except some gray pixels.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Match Score: 0.3
    *   Diff: `[[False False False False False  True  True  True  True  True]
 [False  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True False]
 [False  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True False]
 [ True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True]
 [False  True  True  True  True  True  True  True  True False]
 [False False False False False  True  True  True  True  True]]`
    *   Observation: Better than Example 1 but still low. This suggests a partial but incomplete rule.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 0
    input_objects:
      - object_1:
          type: rectangle
          color: gray #5
          border_color: gray, white, blue # 5, 0, 8
          dimensions: 3x3
    output_objects:
      - object_1:
          type: rectangle
          color: gray and blue # 5 and 8
          border_color: gray and white # 5,0
          dimensions: 6x6
    transformation: Input grid is expanded, maintaining an outer border of the input's colors, and filling the internal region to create a larger rectangle.

  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - object_1:
           type: rectangle
           color: magenta #6
           border_color: white, magenta # 0, 6
           dimensions: 3x3
    output_objects:
      - object_1:
          type: rectangle
          color: magenta and white
          border_color: white, magenta
          dimensions: 6x6
    transformation: Input grid is expanded, creating a larger rectangle. The border colors of input are present.

  - example: 2
    input_objects:
      - object_1:
        type: rectangle
        color: gray, azure
        border_color: azure
        dimensions: 3x5
    output_objects:
      - object_1:
        type: rectangle
        color: gray and azure
        border_color: azure
        dimensions: 5 x 10
    transformation: Input grid is expanded, maintaining border, expanding width more than height.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Border:** The output grid always contains an "expanded" version of the input grid. The border of the input grid plays a key role. The colors along the input border are preserved and expanded outwards.
2.  **Expansion Dimensions**:
    - width is doubled
    - height is increased by 2
3. **Interior Filling**: The central color of the expanded area takes on a combined characteristic. It seems the original shape of the interior is copied.

Let's refine the filling and expansion ideas further.
- The input grid is doubled along the x-axis (width).
- The input grid has 2 rows added (height is +2).
- There is some kind of mirroring of the input in the doubled area and some kind of 'smearing' or duplication into new rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
