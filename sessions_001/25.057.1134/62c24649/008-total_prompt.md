## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 3 1
1 3 0
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9C7B50>

**output:**
```
3 3 1 1 3 3
1 3 0 0 3 1
0 2 2 2 2 0
0 2 2 2 2 0
1 3 0 0 3 1
3 3 1 1 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1C9C7ED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be replicated and expanded outwards to create the output grid. The colors/numbers in the input grid are maintained in their relative positions within the larger output grid. The expansion seems to be symmetric, with the original input grid centered in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Replicates and expands the input grid.
    properties:
      - type: symmetric
      - factor: 2 (input dimensions are doubled)

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid via expansion.
    details: The center of the input grid corresponds to the center of the output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the input grid:** Determine the dimensions (rows and columns) of the input grid.
2.  **Determine the output grid size:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to get the dimensions of the output grid (e.g. a 3x3 input creates a 6x6 output).
3. **Center Replication:** Copy input to the center of output.
4.  **Replicate Rows:** Copy first and last rows to the top and bottom of output.
5. **Replicate Columns:** Copy first and last colums to the left and right of output.

Essentially, the input grid is replicated symmetrically to produce the output grid with original input in the center.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
