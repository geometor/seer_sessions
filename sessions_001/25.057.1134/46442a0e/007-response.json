The colors involved are orange (7) and azure (8). The output grid appears to be a scaled-up and mirrored version of the input, with an added symmetrical structure.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each pixel in the original grid becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the scaled grid.\n\n2. **Mirror and combine to form cross shape:** using the upscaled input grid as a basis:\n    - make a horizontal mirror image of this grid, and put the mirror image to\n      the right of the upscaled image\n    - make a vertical mirror image of the upscaled image, and put this image\n      below the upscaled image\n\nThe final output is the upscaled input in the top left, with a mirrored image to the right, and a mirrored image below.\n\nEssentially the process duplicates the scaled grid on all sides to make a cross.\n"
