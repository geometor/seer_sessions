The input grid appears to be a 3x3 matrix with three distinct colors (represented by the numbers 6, 9, and 4). The output grid is a 6x6 matrix, and it seems to be an expansion or framing of the original input, with the addition of new elements, that includes pixels from the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The new locations will be:\n\n    *   Original top right (0,2), rotated 90 deg -> (5,2)\n    *   Original top right (0,2), rotated 180 deg -> (5,5)\n    *   Original top right (0,2), rotated 270 deg -> (2,5)\n\n4. **Frame:**\n    * Fill the entire first row of the new grid with the leftmost column of the input, so first row is all '6'\n    * Fill the entire last row of the new grid with the leftmost column of the input, so the last row is alternating '6', '9'\n    * fill the first column of the new grid with the pattern of the left column\n      from the original grid ('6','6','6')\n    * fill the last column of the new grid with pattern of the left column from\n      the original grid, rotated 90 degrees clockwise, this makes the right\n      column into '6', '9','6'\n    * The second and fifth row's first and last digits have been filled, so we fill the second entries with the top-left '6', and second to last entry with a '9'.\n    * Similarly, on the second and second to last column, fill with '6' and '9', and fill the fifth element with '6'.\n\nIn essence the original input 3 x 3 pixels are arranged as a frame, and the\ninner square are expanded to the twice the size.\n"
