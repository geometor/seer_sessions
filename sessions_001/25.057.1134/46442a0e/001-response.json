The input grid consists of four cells, each with a single digit number (either 6 or 8) and a specific background color (either azure or magenta). The output grid appears to be a tiled version of the input, with a specific arrangement of the input cells. The colors and numbers in the output grid directly correspond to the input grid. The size relationship between the input (2x2) and the output (4x4) suggests a doubling or replication in both dimensions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
