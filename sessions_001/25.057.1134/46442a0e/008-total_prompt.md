## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 7 8
7 7 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CC2F6D0>

**output:**
```
7 7 8 8 7 7
7 7 8 8 7 7
8 8 8 8 8 8
8 8 8 8 8 8
7 7 8 8 7 7
7 7 8 8 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1CB17450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors involved are orange (7) and azure (8). The output grid appears to be a scaled-up and mirrored version of the input, with an added symmetrical structure.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [7, 8]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: [7, 8]
  - relationship: output_grid is a scaled and mirrored transformation of input_grid
  - action: scaling
    factor: 2
    axis: both (horizontal and vertical)
  - action: mirroring_horizontal
    performed_on: scaled input
  - action: mirroring_vertical
      performed_on: scaled input
  - spatial_relationship: output maintains relative positions of colors from input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scale:** Double the size of the input grid in both dimensions (horizontally and vertically). Each pixel in the original grid becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the scaled grid.

2. **Mirror and combine to form cross shape:** using the upscaled input grid as a basis:
    - make a horizontal mirror image of this grid, and put the mirror image to
      the right of the upscaled image
    - make a vertical mirror image of the upscaled image, and put this image
      below the upscaled image

The final output is the upscaled input in the top left, with a mirrored image to the right, and a mirrored image below.

Essentially the process duplicates the scaled grid on all sides to make a cross.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
