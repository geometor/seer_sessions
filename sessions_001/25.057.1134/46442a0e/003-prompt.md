Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves mirroring and tiling a 2x2 input grid to create a 4x4 output grid. The input grid is mirrored horizontally, and then the original and mirrored grids are tiled in a 2x2 pattern to form the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms a 2x2 input grid into a 4x4 output grid by mirroring and tiling.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Mirror the input grid horizontally.
    mirrored_array = np.fliplr(input_array)

    # Combine to create the 4x4 output
    # concatenate tiles horizontally
    top_row = np.concatenate((input_array, mirrored_array), axis=1)
    bottom_row = np.concatenate((mirrored_array, input_array), axis=1)

    # combine tiles vertically to make a 4x4 output
    output_grid = np.concatenate((top_row, bottom_row), axis=0)

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
