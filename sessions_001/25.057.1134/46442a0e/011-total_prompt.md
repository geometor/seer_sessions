Previous Code:
```python
"""
Scale up the input grid by a factor of 2. Each pixel in the input grid becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get the dimensions of the input grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Create a new grid with dimensions scaled up by a factor of 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows * 2, cols * 2), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Get the color of the current pixel
            color = input_grid[i, j]

            # Create a 2x2 block in the output grid with the same color
            output_grid[i*2:i*2+2, j*2:j*2+2] = color

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
