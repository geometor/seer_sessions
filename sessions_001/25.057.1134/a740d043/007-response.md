Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 7x7 grid. Most cells are blue (value 1). There are two green (value 3) cells and two red (value 2) cells in specific locations.
*   The output is a 2x3 grid. It contains only the green (3), white/background (0), and red (2) colors, arranged in the same relative positions as they appear within the clusters in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 7x7
  - output_grid_size: 2x3
  - input_colors:
      - blue: 1
      - green: 3
      - red: 2
  - output_colors:
      - green: 3
      - white: 0
      - red: 2
  - object_1:
      type: cluster
      color_1: green
      color_2: red
      relative_position: color_1 is left of color_2
      instance_count: 2
  - background_color:
    input: 1
    output: 0

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the two clusters of non-blue pixels. In this case Green(3) and Red(2), they are in a cluster together, sharing a border, and repeated twice
2.  Extract each cluster separately. These can be treated as two separate objects.
3.  Represent the object to a new output grid.
4. Change the background color from blue (1) to white(0).
5.  Preserve the relative positions of the colored pixels from input object to output object.
