- task: 9f2769b6
  observations:
    - input_objects:
        - description: Non-blue clusters (red and green).
          properties:
            - color: red (2) or green (3)
            - shape: variable, contiguous
            - adjacency: pixels within a cluster are adjacent (up, down, left, or right)
    - output_objects:
        - description: Representation of each input cluster, maintaining relative horizontal positioning between separate outputs.
          properties:
            - color: same as input cluster
            - shape: preserved from input cluster
            - background: white (0)
    - actions:
      - identify: Locate non-blue clusters in the input grid.
      - extract: Copy each identified cluster.
      - reposition: Place each cluster, preserving the structure.
      - background_change: Set all background pixels to white (0).
      - multiple_outputs: separate non-adjacent clusters into separate output grids
