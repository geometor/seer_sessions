The input grid contains maroon (9) and gray (5) pixels, while the output grid contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of some pixels. The positions of the maroon pixels in the output grid correspond to the positions of some of the maroon and gray pixels on the input. All other pixels in the output is white.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If a pixel is maroon, keep as maroon.\n3. **Conditional Replacement, part 2 (Grey):** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. If a pixel is gray, keep as maroon.\n4.  **Conditional Replacement, part 3 (other):** All the other pixels become white.\n5. **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule is to \"keep and reposition the maroon pixels in the input grid and set all other pixels to white\". The gray and the maroon are set to the position of the maroon.\n"
