## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 6 6 6
6 5 5 6 6
6 6 5 5 6
6 6 6 5 5
5 6 6 6 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1CE02350>

**output:**
```
6 6 0 0 0
0 6 6 0 0
0 0 6 6 0
0 0 0 6 6
6 0 0 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1CAD39D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: gray (5) and magenta (6). The output grid seems to retain the magenta (6) pixels in the same locations but replaces the gray (5) pixels with white (0) pixels, while preserving the positions of the magenta pixels . The dimensions of the grid remain constant (5x5).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - description: Input grid dimensions
    value: 5x5
  - description: Output grid dimensions
    value: 5x5
  - description: Input grid colors
    values:
      - 5 (gray)
      - 6 (magenta)
  - description: Output grid colors
    values:
      - 0 (white)
      - 6 (magenta)
  - description: Transformation rule
    details: |
          Magenta (6) pixels retain their color and position. Gray (5) pixels are all replaced with White (0)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  If the pixel's value is 6 (magenta), maintain that same value and location in the output grid.
3.  If the pixel value is 5 (gray), replace that with the value (0), maintaining the location in the output grid.
4.  The output should be same dimensions of input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
