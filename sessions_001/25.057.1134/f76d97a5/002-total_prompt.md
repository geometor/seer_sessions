## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 5 4
5 5 5
4 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CE02350>

**output:**
```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB81850>
Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations in a structured format.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
*   The input grid contains the values 4 and 5, representing yellow and gray, respectively.
*   The output grid contains the values 0 and 4, representing white and yellow, respectively.
*   The transformation seems to involve replacing all instances of '5' (gray) in the input with '0' (white) and retaining the '4' (yellow) values.
* The position of yellow pixels stays at the same place, and other colors are replaced to white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [2,0], [2,2]]
      - value: 5
        color: gray
        positions: [[0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,1]]

  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [2,0], [2,2]]
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        positions:  [[0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,1]]

actions:
  - type: replace
    source_value: 5
    target_value: 0
  - type: retain
    value: 4

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
    - type: transformational
      description: "input grid values are either retained or replaced based on rules"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  If the cell value is 5 (gray), replace it with 0 (white).
3.  If the cell value is 4 (yellow), retain the value (keep as 4).
4.  The output grid has the same position for all colors.
5.  Output will the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
