Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is treated as a 3x3 "core" sub-grid. This core is replicated to construct a 2x2 arrangement of cores. Each time the core is replicated it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Arrange these replicated cores to create the final 6x6 grid.

def transform(input_grid):

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, assuming a 3x3 core replication and rotation. The provided results indicate this assumption holds true for all given training examples. The code successfully transforms all training inputs to their expected outputs. Since there are no errors, our strategy is to simply confirm the existing logic and provide the requested deliverables, focusing on a clear and accurate description of the transformation.

**Metrics and Observations**

Since the code is 100% correct on train data, I will manually construct the observations
instead of code execution.

**Example 1:**

-   **Input Size:** 3x3
-   **Output Size:** 6x6
-   **Transformation:** The 3x3 input is replicated four times, with each replica rotated 90 degrees clockwise from the previous one. These are arranged in a 2x2 grid to form the 6x6 output.
- **Result**: correct

**Example 2:**

-   **Input Size:** 3x3
-   **Output Size:** 6x6
-   **Transformation:** Same as Example 1.
- **Result**: correct

**Example 3:**

-   **Input Size:** 3x3
-   **Output Size:** 6x6
-   **Transformation:** Same as Example 1.
- **Result**: correct

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: core_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      colors: [0-9] # Assuming all colors can be present
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 6x6
      colors: [0-9]

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: The core_grid is replicated four times.
    agent: system
    target: core_grid

  - name: rotate
    description: Each replicated core_grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise relative to the previous one.
    agent: system
    target: replicated core_grid

  - name: arrange
    description: The original core_grid and its three rotated replicas are arranged in a 2x2 grid to form the output_grid.
    agent: system
    target: [core_grid, rotated core_grids]
    result: output_grid
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Core:** The input grid is a 3x3 grid, which we'll call the "core."

2.  **Replicate and Rotate:** Create four copies of the core.
    *   The first copy is the original core.
    *   The second copy is the core rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   The third copy is the core rotated 180 degrees clockwise (or, equivalently, the second copy rotated 90 degrees clockwise).
    *   The fourth copy is the core rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or, equivalently, the third copy rotated 90 degrees clockwise).

3.  **Arrange in 2x2 Grid:** Arrange the four core copies in a 2x2 grid:
    *   Top-left: Original core.
    *   Top-right: 90-degree rotated core.
    *   Bottom-left: 180-degree rotated core.
    *   Bottom-right: 270-degree rotated core.

4.  **Output:** The resulting 6x6 grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
