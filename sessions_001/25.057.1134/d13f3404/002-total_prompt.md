## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 1 0
3 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9C69D0>

**output:**
```
6 1 0 0 0 0
3 6 1 0 0 0
0 3 6 1 0 0
0 0 3 6 1 0
0 0 0 3 6 1
0 0 0 0 3 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1CAD2DD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. The colors in the input grid (magenta, blue, green, and white) appear to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern in the output grid. The most prominent feature is the diagonal pattern formed from top-left to bottom-right. The initial non-white colored pixels seem to be triggering the creation of a diagonal line of the same color.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3, output grid is 6x6.
  - observation: Output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.
  - object: Input grid pixels with colors.
  - property: Pixel color (magenta=6, blue=1, green=3, white=0).
  - property: Pixel position (row, column).
  - action: Replication of colored pixels.
  - action: Diagonal arrangement of replicated pixels.
  - relationship:  Each non-white pixel in the input grid generates a diagonal line of the same color, starting at the pixel's doubled position in the output, extending to the bottom-right.
  - observation: The origin or top-left corner of the input grid corresponds with the top-left of the output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with dimensions double the size of the input grid. Initialize all cells to white (0).

2.  **Iteration:** For each pixel in the input grid:

    *   If the pixel is not white (0):
        *   Determine the starting position in the output grid by doubling the row and column indices of the current input pixel.
        *   Draw a diagonal line of the same color as the input pixel, starting from the calculated starting position, downwards and to the right, until the edge of the output grid is reached.

3.  **Output:** The resulting output grid represents the transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
