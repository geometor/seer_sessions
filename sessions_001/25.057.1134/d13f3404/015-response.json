            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved replicating and rotating a 3x3 core grid. The testing reveals that this approach is correct for the first two examples but fails for the third. The core issue seems to be the assumption that the \"core\" is always a 3x3 grid and originates at [0,0]. The third example indicates a different core size or structure.\n\nMy strategy to address this is:\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each example. Pay close attention to Example 3, where the current logic fails. I need to identify what part of the input acts as a \"seed\" or \"core\" and how exactly is this \"seed\" transformed, and what is the overall logic of arranging it in output.\n2.  **Object & Pattern Identification:** Determine if the concept of a \"core\" is still valid, or if a different pattern-matching/transformation approach is needed, and reevaluate \"objects\" and actions.\n3.  **Adaptive Core Detection:**  Instead of hardcoding a 3x3 core, the program should dynamically determine what the \"core\" is in input.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately and completely describe the transformation, accommodating the dynamic core detection.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere are some specific observations using code execution to gain more information.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    print(f\"  Shape: {grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Unique values: {np.unique(grid)}\")\n    print(f\"  First row: {grid[0, :]}\")\n\ndef analyze_results(task):\n    print(f\"Task: {task['name']}\")\n    for i, example in enumerate(task['train']):\n        print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n        input_grid = example['input']\n        expected_output_grid = example['output']\n        actual_output_grid = transform(input_grid)\n\n        print(\"  Input:\")\n        describe_grid(input_grid)\n        print(\"  Expected Output:\")\n        describe_grid(expected_output_grid)\n        print(\"  Actual Output:\")\n        describe_grid(actual_output_grid)\n\n        if np.array_equal(expected_output_grid, actual_output_grid):\n            print(\"  Result: Pass\")\n        else:\n            print(\"  Result: Fail\")\n            \ntask = {\n    \"name\": \"Example Task\",\n    \"train\": [\n        {\n            \"input\": [[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]],\n            \"output\": [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]],\n            \"output\": [[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 7], [7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 7], [4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4], [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]]\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [[5, 5, 8, 5, 5], [5, 5, 8, 5, 5]],\n            \"output\": [[5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5], [5, 5, 8, 5, 5, 8, 5, 5]]\n        }\n    ]\n}\nanalyze_results(task)\n```\n\n```\nTask: Example Task\nExample 1:\n  Input:\n  Shape: (3, 3)\n  Unique values: [5]\n  First row: [5 5 5]\n  Expected Output:\n  Shape: (6, 6)\n  Unique values: [5]\n  First row: [5 5 5 5 5 5]\n  Actual Output:\n  Shape: (6, 6)\n  Unique values: [5]\n  First row: [5 5 5 5 5 5]\n  Result: Pass\nExample 2:\n  Input:\n  Shape: (3, 3)\n  Unique values: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\n  First row: [1 2 3]\n  Expected Output:\n  Shape: (6, 6)\n  Unique values: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\n  First row: [1 2 3 3 2 1]\n  Actual Output:\n  Shape: (6, 6)\n  Unique values: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]\n  First row: [1 2 3 3 2 1]\n  Result: Pass\nExample 3:\n  Input:\n  Shape: (2, 5)\n  Unique values: [5 8]\n  First row: [5 5 8 5 5]\n  Expected Output:\n  Shape: (2, 8)\n  Unique values: [5 8]\n  First row: [5 5 8 5 5 8 5 5]\n  Actual Output:\n  Shape: (6, 6)\n  Unique values: [0 5 8]\n  First row: [5 5 8 5 5 0]\n  Result: Fail\n```\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_number: 1\n    input_shape: (3, 3)\n    output_shape: (6, 6)\n    transformation: \"Replication and Rotation\"\n    core_size: (3, 3)\n    core_identified: True\n    result: Pass\n  - example_number: 2\n    input_shape: (3, 3)\n    output_shape: (6, 6)\n    transformation: \"Replication and Rotation\"\n    core_size: (3, 3)\n    core_identified: True\n    result: Pass\n  - example_number: 3\n    input_shape: (2, 5)\n    output_shape: (2, 8)\n    transformation: \"Horizontal Extension\"\n    core_size: (2,5)\n    core_identified: False\n    result: Fail\n    notes: \"The input grid is extended horizontally by repeating a specific segment. In this case the segment [8,5,5] is appended after the core [5,5,8,5,5].\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the repeating unit/core.** In examples 1 and 2, the core is the entire input grid (3x3). In example 3, the core is the entire input grid (2x5).\n\n2.  **Determine the transformation rule for expansion.**\n    *   Examples 1 & 2: The core is replicated in a 2x2 grid. Each replica is rotated 90 degrees clockwise from its top-left neighbor.\n    *   Example 3: The core is extended horizontally. find a sequence within the core by comparing sequences on each side to discover repeated sequences.\n\n3.  **Construct the output grid.** Assemble the output by applying the determined expansion/replication/rotation rule. Example 3 requires appending a sequence, identified as [8,5,5].\n\nRevised Natural Language Program (focusing on Example 3):\n\n\"The input grid is considered as the core. Examine the core to find repeated sequences by starting with the longest possible sequence and working backward to single pixels. When the input contains a repeated segments at each end, the segment is appended to the input to create the output. If there are no repeating segments, rotate 90 degrees and arrange as a 2x2 grid. \"\n"
