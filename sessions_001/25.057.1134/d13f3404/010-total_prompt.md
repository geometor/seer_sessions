Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid (3x3) is transformed into a larger output grid (6x6).  The transformation replicates each non-zero pixel in the input grid diagonally down and to the right in the output grid. The output grid is double the dimensions of the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels
    for row in range(input_height):
        for col in range(input_width):
            pixel_value = input_grid[row, col]
            if pixel_value != 0:
                output_grid[row * 2, col * 2] = pixel_value
                output_grid[row * 2 + 1, col * 2 + 1] = pixel_value

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example. The core idea of doubling the dimensions and replicating non-zero pixels diagonally is correct. However, the provided examples and test results reveal that this initial implementation needs refinement to handle cases beyond first example.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results**: I need to go through each training example and its associated test result. I have access to code execution to generate a report comparing the expected and actual outputs.
2.  **Identify Discrepancies**: The results from code execution will give me structured insight into where the current implementation works and where it doesn't and that will let me determine which parts of the natural language program require adjustments.
3.  **Refine Program**: Based on the discrepancies, update the YAML and, more critically, the natural language program description to reflect the observed behavior accurately.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I will now use a `report` to check the results.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
