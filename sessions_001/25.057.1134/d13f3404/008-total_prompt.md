## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 4 0
0 8 0
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CAD3350>

**output:**
```
0 4 0 0 0 0
0 8 4 0 0 0
2 0 8 4 0 0
0 2 0 8 4 0
0 0 2 0 8 4
0 0 0 2 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1C9C6BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The input grid contains single-digit numbers (0, 4, 8, 2) representing different colors. The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with the original numbers and their corresponding colors replicated and shifted diagonally. The background color is white (0).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        role: background
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        role: data_point
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        role: data_point
      - value: 2
        color: red
        role: data_point
    properties:
      - original

  - type: output_grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        role: background
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        role: replicated_data_point
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        role: replicated_data_point
      - value: 2
        color: red
        role: replicated_data_point
    properties:
      - expanded
    relations:
      - type: expansion
        from: input_grid
        to: output_grid
        rule: diagonal replication and shift

  - type: objects
    description: each non-zero pixel in the input grid.
    properties:
     - color
     - original position
     - replicated positions
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is twice the height and twice the width of the input grid. Fill the output grid with the background color (0, white).

2.  **Replication:** For each non-zero pixel in the input grid:
    *   Copy the pixel's value (color) to the corresponding position in the output grid (multiply input row and column indices by 2 to find top left corner of each expanded cell) .
    *   Copy the pixel's value diagonally down and to the right. (output row +1, output col +1)

3. **Complete Output:** The output grid now contains the expanded and diagonally replicated pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
