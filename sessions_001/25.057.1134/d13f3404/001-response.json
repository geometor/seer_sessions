The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid. The colors in the input grid (magenta, blue, green, and white) appear to be replicated and arranged in a specific pattern in the output grid. The most prominent feature is the diagonal pattern formed from top-left to bottom-right. The initial non-white colored pixels seem to be triggering the creation of a diagonal line of the same color.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
