## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0
0 0 5 0 0
5 5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1C9C6AD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 0 0
5 5 1 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1C88EBD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (5x5).  There are changes in the positions and values of some digits (colors) between the input and output. Specifically, the blue pixel (1) and some of gray pixels (5) seem to swap their locations.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
    details: Both are 5x5 grids.
  - object: blue_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    initial_position: [2, 2] # [row, column], 0-indexed
    final_position: [4, 2]
  - object: gray_pixels
    color: gray (5)
    initial_positions:
        - [3,2]
        - [4,0]
        - [4,1]
        - [4,2]
        - [4,3]
        - [4,4]
    final_positions:
        - [3,2]
        - [4,0]
        - [4,1]
        - [4,3]
        - [4,4]
  - action: swap
    description: The blue pixel (1) appears to move down two rows, and the gray pixel at the original place became the empty area in output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the single blue pixel (value 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** the gray pixels (value 5) in the input grid.
3.  **Locate** the gray pixel in the location two rows below the blue pixel.
4. **Swap** them. Place the blue pixel where the referenced gray pixel and place a gray pixel where the blue pixel was.

Essentially, move the '1' two rows down, and the '5' that was originally there, is now the empty area.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
