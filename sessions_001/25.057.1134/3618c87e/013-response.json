The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The transformation appears to involve a vertical mirroring or reflection, with some color changes. Specifically, blue (1) pixels in the input become gray (5) in the output, and gray (5) become blue (1) in the output. This swap or exchange is only between the values 1 and 5.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This means the top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on.\n2.  **Color Swap**: As part of, or after, the reflection process, the colors are swapped based on the input color:\n    *   If a pixel is blue (1) in the input, it becomes gray (5) in the output.\n    *   If a pixel is gray (5) in the input, it becomes blue (1) in the output.\n    *   If a pixel is white(0), it remains white (0)\n\nEssentially this is vertical reflection and color replacement combined.\n"
