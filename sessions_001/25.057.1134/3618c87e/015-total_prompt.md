Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is vertically reflected. This means the top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on.
As part of, or after, the reflection process, the colors are swapped based on the input color:
    *   If a pixel is blue (1) in the input, it becomes gray (5) in the output.
    *   If a pixel is gray (5) in the input, it becomes blue (1) in the output.
    *   If a pixel is white(0), it remains white (0)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
