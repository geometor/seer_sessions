## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 5 0 0 5
5 5 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1C9B30D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 5
5 1 5 5 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x74AF1CCD9550>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The transformation appears to involve a vertical mirroring or reflection, with some color changes. Specifically, blue (1) pixels in the input become gray (5) in the output, and gray (5) become blue (1) in the output. This swap or exchange is only between the values 1 and 5.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    dimensions: 5x5
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - gray (5)
  - transformation: vertical_reflection_with_color_swap
    description: The grid is reflected vertically, and a color swap occurs.
    color_swap_rules:
      - input: 1
        output: 5
      - input: 5
        output: 1
      - input: 0
        output: 0
  - observation: objects keep locations relative to other objects within the same row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Reflect:** The input grid is vertically reflected. This means the top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second-to-last row, and so on.
2.  **Color Swap**: As part of, or after, the reflection process, the colors are swapped based on the input color:
    *   If a pixel is blue (1) in the input, it becomes gray (5) in the output.
    *   If a pixel is gray (5) in the input, it becomes blue (1) in the output.
    *   If a pixel is white(0), it remains white (0)

Essentially this is vertical reflection and color replacement combined.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
