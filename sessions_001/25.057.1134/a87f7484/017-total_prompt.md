Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code, designed after observing the first example, correctly identifies the core concept: extracting a subgrid around the yellow (color 4) pixels. However, it fails to generalize to all cases. Specifically, it appears that we may need to rotate the extracted object. The existing code assumes the bounding box of the yellow pixel(s) in the input directly maps to the output, without any transformations *within* the bounding box other than cropping.

The strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze Failures:** Carefully examine the bounding box logic and how the output is derived in cases where the prediction is incorrect.
2.  **Refine Object Identification:** Ensure the code robustly identifies all yellow pixels and determines the correct bounds.
3.  **Incorporate Rotation:** Determine the rule governing the apparent rotation or rearrangement of pixels.
4. **Iterative improvement** Update the natural language, and update the code based on these examples.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

The provided code already generates useful reports. Running it results in these observations:

*   **Example 1:** Correct. The bounding box is extracted, and the output matches.
*   **Example 2:** Incorrect. The contents within the bounding box are identical between input and predicted output. The expected shows some form of 90 degree rotation of the extracted object.
*   **Example 3:** Incorrect. Like Example 2, the extracted content is identical to the sub-grid of the input, but does not match the expected value. the output seems to have some form of 90 degree rotation of the extracted object.
*    **Example 4:** Correct. There is only the single yellow pixel.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Yellow Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color value 4 (yellow) within the input grid.
2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that encompasses all identified yellow pixels.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid defined by the bounding box.
4.  **Rotate:** Rotate the extracted subgrid 90 degrees clockwise.
5.  **Output:** The rotated subgrid is the output. If there are no yellow pixels, return an empty grid (or potentially a 1x1 grid with a default value – this needs clarification from more examples if they exist).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
