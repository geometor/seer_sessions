The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on a specific color and its arrangement. The most prominent feature is the extraction of the yellow (4) pixels and their spatial relationship. Other colors seem to be irrelevant to the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
