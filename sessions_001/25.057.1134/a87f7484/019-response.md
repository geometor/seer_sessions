Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger and contains multiple distinct colored regions (objects). The output grid is smaller and seems to correspond to a specific section of the input grid. The transformation involves identifying a sub-grid within the input. The non-zero values are all along the perimeter of the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: 12
      - width: 3
      - values: [0, 2, 3, 7, 8]
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: 3
      - width: 3
      - values: [0, 7]
  - observation: output_grid is a subregion of input_grid
  - observation: output grid contains top left corner object.
  - observation: the output grid is the smallest possible square

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Locate the object formed by contiguous non-zero pixels in the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Determine Sub-grid Boundaries:** find the smallest bounding box to contain this object.
3.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract the region defined by the bounding box.
4.  **Output:** The extracted sub-grid is the output.

In simpler terms, the program finds the smallest top-left object and extracts it.
