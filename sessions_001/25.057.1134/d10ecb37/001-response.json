The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from the top-left quadrant of the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid appear to be related to the dimensions of the input, seemingly by halving both height and width. The core operation, at a high level, is downsampling or extracting a subgrid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
