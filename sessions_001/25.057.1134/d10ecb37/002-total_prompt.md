## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 3 6 4 0 6
6 0 0 3 3 4
6 4 4 3 3 0
0 3 6 0 4 6
0 6 3 0 4 3
3 4 4 6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1CB80BD0>

**output:**
```
4 3
6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x74AF1CB81950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into a smaller 2D grid. The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from the top-left quadrant of the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid appear to be related to the dimensions of the input, seemingly by halving both height and width. The core operation, at a high level, is downsampling or extracting a subgrid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      properties:
        height: 6
        width: 6
  - output_grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      properties:
        height: 2
        width: 2
relationships:
  - spatial:
      description: output_grid appears to be a subgrid of the input_grid.
      details: output grid corresponds to the top-left quadrant of the input.
  - dimensional:
    description: output grid dimensions are half of input grid
transformations:
  - type: Subgrid Extraction/Downsampling
    description: The top-left quadrant of input forms output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Divide the input grid's height and width by 3 to get the output grid's height and width, respectively.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid with the calculated dimensions. Populate this new grid with values from the input grid, taking elements from the top-left quadrant. Specifically, the element at `output[row][col]` will be equal to `input[row][col]`.
3. Return new grid


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
