## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 4 2 2 5 2 4 5
2 5 5 4 4 2 2 2
4 5 5 2 2 2 2 4
2 2 4 2 5 4 2 5
2 4 2 2 5 2 4 5
2 5 5 4 4 2 2 2
4 5 5 2 2 2 2 4
2 2 4 2 5 4 2 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x74AF1CE107D0>

**output:**
```
2 4
2 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x74AF1CB80BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a larger grid of colored squares (represented by single-digit numbers), and the output is a much smaller grid. The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from the input grid. There's a clear reduction in size, suggesting some form of summarization or pattern extraction. The output grid appears to be a 2x2 grid. The specific colors present in the output (red, yellow, gray) also exist in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    elements:
      - color: red (2)
      - color: yellow (4)
      - color: gray (5)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements:
      - color: red (2)
        location: (0,0)
      - color: yellow (4)
        location: (0,1)
      - color: red (2)
        location: (1,0)
      - color: gray (5)
        location: (1,1)
  - observation:
      description: output grid colors are present in the input grid.
  - observation:
      description: output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - observation:
      description: colors in the output seem to represent colors from each quadrant of input
  - action: derive_output_grid_top_left:
    input: sub-grid of Input, top-left quadrant, coordinates(0:3, 0:3)
    description: select top-left most common color, and use the value of the most frequent color at this area to determine the output color at (0,0)
  - action: derive_output_grid_top_right:
      input: sub-grid of Input, top-right quadrant, coordinates(0:3, 4:7)
    description: select top-right most common color, and use the value of the most frequent color at this area to determine the output color at (0,1)
  - action: derive_output_grid_bottom_left:
      input: sub-grid of Input, bottom-left quadrant, coordinates(4:7, 0:3)
    description:  select bottom-left most common color, and use the value of the most frequent color at this area to determine the output color at (1,0)
  - action: derive_output_grid_bottom_right:
      input: sub-grid of Input, bottom-right quadrant, coordinates(4:7, 4:7)
    description:  select bottom-right most common color, and use the value of the most frequent color at this area to determine the output color at (1,1)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into four equal quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Since the example input is 8x8, each quadrant will be 4x4.
2.  **Quadrant Analysis - Top Left:** Within the top-left quadrant, identify the most frequently occurring color.
3. **Output Mapping (0, 0):** The most frequent color in the top-left quadrant becomes the color of the cell at position (0, 0) in the output grid.
4.  **Quadrant Analysis - Top Right:** Within the top-right quadrant, identify the most frequently occurring color.
5. **Output Mapping (0, 1):** The most frequent color in the top-right quadrant becomes the color of the cell at position (0, 1) in the output grid.
6.  **Quadrant Analysis - Bottom Left:** Within the bottom-left quadrant, identify the most frequently occurring color.
7. **Output Mapping (1, 0):** The most frequent color in the bottom-left quadrant becomes the color of the cell at position (1, 0) in the output grid.
8.  **Quadrant Analysis - Bottom Right:** Within the bottom-right quadrant, identify the most frequently occurring color.
9. **Output Mapping (1, 1):** The most frequent color in the bottom-right quadrant becomes the color of the cell at position (1, 1) in the output grid.

In summary, the transformation creates a 2x2 "summary" of the input grid by taking the most frequent color from each of the four quadrants.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
