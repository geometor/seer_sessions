## Example 3

**input:**
```
3 2 1 3 4 1
1 4 4 2 2 3
1 3 3 2 2 4
4 2 1 4 3 1
4 1 2 4 3 2
2 3 3 1 1 4
2 4 4 1 1 3
3 1 2 3 4 2
3 2 1 3 4 1
1 4 4 2 2 3
1 3 3 2 2 4
4 2 1 4 3 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x768 at 0x74AF378ACB50>

**output:**
```
3 2
1 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x74AF1C88ECD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a significantly smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain a repeating pattern, while the output grid seems to extract a core segment of that pattern. The colors (represented by digits) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid. The spatial arrangement of the colors in the output is a subset of the input's arrangement. It seems the input is divided into blocks.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        height: 12
        width: 6
        elements: [3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 2, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1, 4, 3, 1]
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      properties:
        height: 2
        width: 2
        elements: [3, 2, 1, 4]
  - block:
      type: subgrid
      properties:
          height: 2
          width: 2

actions:
  - identify_repeating_pattern:
      input: input_grid
      output: block
  - extract_block:
      input: input_grid
      parameters:
         start_row: 0
         start_col: 0
      output: output_grid

relationships:
  - output_is_subgrid_of_input:
      subject: output_grid
      object: input_grid
  - repeating_pattern_in_input:
      subject: input_grid
      property: contains 6x repetitions of block
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Repeating Unit:** Examine the input grid and determine the smallest repeating rectangular block of pixels. In this case, visually inspect to find a 2x2 block that repeats.
2.  **Extract the Top-Left Block**: Extract the 2x2 block from the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the input grid.
3.  **Output the Block:** The extracted 2x2 block becomes the output grid.

In simpler terms, the transformation identifies and extracts the fundamental repeating 2x2 unit from the top-left of the input grid to create the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
