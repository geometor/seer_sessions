The input grid transforms into a larger output grid. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and azure (8). The azure pixels appear to form a pattern, and this pattern is expanded in the output. The core transformation seems related to duplicating the azure pixels and potentially shifting them to create a larger, more complex pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Fill the output grid with white pixels (0).\n\n2.  **Azure Pixel Expansion**: For each azure (8) pixel in the input grid, perform the following:\n\n    *    Place an azure pixel in the output grid at the corresponding, scaled position (multiply original row and col by 2).\n\n    *   Also, fill the neighbor positions: down, right, and down+right, to the original position.\n\n3.  **Output:** The resulting output grid represents the transformed pattern.\n\nIn essence, each original Azure pixel \"expands\" to a 2 X 2 square of the azure pixels in the output grid.\n"
