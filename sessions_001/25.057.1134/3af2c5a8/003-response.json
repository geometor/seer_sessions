            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved expanding azure (8) pixels into 2x2 blocks. The provided code correctly implements this transformation. The results show that this transformation accurately reproduces all training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSince the provided code correctly transforms all provided inputs, the initial hypothesis, implementation and description are correct.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, verifying the transformation:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with a single azure pixel at (1,1).\n    *   Output: 6x6 grid with a 2x2 azure block at (2,2).\n    *   Result: Correct. The azure pixel is correctly expanded.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid with azure pixels at (1,1) and (3,3).\n    *   Output: 10x10 grid with 2x2 azure blocks at (2,2) and (6,6).\n    *   Result: Correct. Both azure pixels are correctly expanded.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input: 7x7 grid with a 2x2 block of azure pixels at (2,2).\n    *    Output: 14x14 with 2x2 azure block starting at (4,4) and another at (4,6) and two more on the next line.\n    *    Result: Correct. All four input azure pixes are correctly expanded.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - colors: [azure, other]\n      - dimensions: variable\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - colors: [azure, other]\n      - dimensions: [2 * input_height, 2 * input_width]\nactions:\n  - name: expand_azure\n    description: Each azure pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of azure pixels in the output grid.\n    input: input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input grid is transformed into an output grid that is double the height and width of the input. Every azure (8) pixel in the input grid becomes a 2x2 block of azure pixels in the output grid, starting at the position of original pixel multiplied by two. Pixels of other colors in the input grid do not appear at all in the output grid.\n"
