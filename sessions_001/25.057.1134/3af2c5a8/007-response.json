The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid also contains the same colors and expands upon the input. The spatial arrangement of colors seems key, with the output appearing to be an inflated, mirrored, or repeated version of the input, with some kind of symmetry.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There's a horizontal and vertical symmetry.\n\n```"

OR first vertically from top-left, and then horizontally.\n\nIn essence, the transformation inflates the input grid by a factor of two in both dimensions, creating a mirrored, symmetrical pattern in the output grid based on the input.\n"
