## Example 3

**input:**
```
1 2 7 1 1 1
2 1 7 7 2 6
2 1 2 6 2 1
1 2 1 7 6 2
2 7 1 2 7 1
2 1 6 2 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1CB82C50>

**output:**
```
1 1 1 7 2 1
6 2 7 7 1 2
1 2 6 2 1 2
2 6 7 1 2 1
1 7 2 1 7 2
7 7 2 6 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1C73B2D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 6x6 grid of single-digit integers, representing colored pixels. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation or reflection, as the spatial arrangement of the numbers changes, but the set of numbers remains the same, suggesting colors are preserved. It's not a simple 90 or 180-degree rotation. It resembles more a reflection, potentially combined with some other operation or a complex rotation on a non-standard axis.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [6, 6]
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_pixels
  - observation: input_output_element_counts_match
    details: The number of occurrences of each digit (0-9) is identical in both input and output grids.
  - transformation_type: geometric
    sub_type: reflection_or_rotation
    details: The transformation appears to involve rearranging the spatial positions of elements, similar to a mirror image or a turn, but not a standard 90/180-degree rotation.
  - axis: unknown
    details: precise rotation is not clear
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Mirror Image:** Create a mirror image of the Input around a vertical axis passing through the center of the grid (a vertical reflection).
2.  **180 degree rotation:** Rotate the entire mirrored image 180 degress. The combination of these steps appears to match the observed input/output.

Alternative interpretation, which ends up with the same result:

1.  **Mirror Image:** Take the mirror image across the main diagonal (\).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
