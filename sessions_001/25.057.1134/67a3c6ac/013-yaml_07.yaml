  - observation: input_output_element_counts_match
    details: The number of occurrences of each digit (0-9) is identical in both input and output grids.
  - transformation_type: geometric
    sub_type: reflection_or_rotation
    details: The transformation appears to involve rearranging the spatial positions of elements, similar to a mirror image or a turn, but not a standard 90/180-degree rotation.
