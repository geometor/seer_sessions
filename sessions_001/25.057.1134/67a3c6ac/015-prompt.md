Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves a reflection of the input grid. It can be viewed in two equivalent ways:

1. First, reflect the grid vertically (across a vertical axis). Then, rotate the reflected grid by 180 degrees.
2. Reflect the grid across the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).

Both procedures lead to the same output. The code below implements the second, simpler method.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by reflecting it across the main diagonal.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Reflect across main diagonal by transposing the array
    output_array = input_array.T

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
