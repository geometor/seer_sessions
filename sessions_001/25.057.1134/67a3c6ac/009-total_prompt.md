Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation is a reflection of the grid across the main diagonal. This means that for every pixel in the input grid at row `r` and column `c`, its new position in the output grid will be at row `c` and column `r`. The color of the pixel remains unchanged during the transformation.

Essentially, we are transposing the input grid to generate the output grid.

    Transforms the input grid by reflecting it across the main diagonal.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_array.shape

    # Create an output array with swapped dimensions.
    output_array = np.empty((cols, rows), dtype=int)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
