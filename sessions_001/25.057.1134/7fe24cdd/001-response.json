The colors and their spatial relationships appear to be crucial. The output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input, with some kind of mirroring or reflection involved, and an increased number of elements. The black borders in the images are probably an artifact and not part of the data.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This quadrant is duplicated directly.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Reflection:** The top-left quadrant is reflected horizontally to create the top-right quadrant. During reflection, the order within each row is mirrored from the original.\n\n3.  **Vertical Reflection:** The top-left quadrant is reflected vertically to form the bottom-left quadrant. During reflection, the rows switch places compared to the original.\n\n4.  **Diagonal Reflection (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):** The content of top-left is reflected across the diagonal line that goes from the upper-left to lower-right. The values from the top-left is transfered down to the bottom-right quadrant, with cell positions reflected with each other.\n\nIn summary, the input grid serves as a base, and a combination of duplications and horizontal, vertical, and diagonal reflections creates the output grid.\n"
