Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output grid is constructed as a 2x2 arrangement, where each section (quadrant) is a reflected version of the input grid.

1.  **Top-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is identical to the input grid. No transformation is applied.

2.  **Top-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is a horizontally reflected copy of the input grid. The input is mirrored along its vertical axis.

3.  **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is a vertically reflected copy of the input grid. The input is mirrored along its horizontal axis.

4.  **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is both horizontally and vertically reflected, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation of the input grid. The input is mirrored along both its vertical and horizontal axes.

The output grid's dimensions are always double the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.

import numpy as np

def reflect_horizontal(grid):
    """Reflects a grid horizontally."""
    return np.fliplr(grid)

def reflect_vertical(grid):
    """Reflects a grid vertically."""
    return np.flipud(grid)

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid into a 2x2 reflected pattern."""
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # Get dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_np.shape
    
    # Initialize the output grid with double the dimensions of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows * 2, cols * 2), dtype=int)
    
    # Top-Left Quadrant: Copy the input grid as is.
    output_grid[:rows, :cols] = input_np
    
    # Top-Right Quadrant: Horizontally reflected copy.
    output_grid[:rows, cols:] = reflect_horizontal(input_np)
    
    # Bottom-Left Quadrant: Vertically reflected copy.
    output_grid[rows:, :cols] = reflect_vertical(input_np)
    
    # Bottom-Right Quadrant: Horizontally and vertically reflected copy.
    output_grid[rows:, cols:] = reflect_horizontal(reflect_vertical(input_np))
    
    return output_grid.tolist()

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: creating a 2x2 grid where each quadrant is a reflection of the input. The code implements horizontal and vertical reflections, and the overall structure is sound. The provided code works perfectly on all the training examples. Since there are no errors, no changes are needed. We will keep the original natural language program and YAML facts.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Since the execution was perfect, we will perform simple observations and checks to determine if any objects in the input have any properties and document any insights:

```tool_code
print(f'{task.train=}')
for i, example in enumerate(task.train):
    input_grid = example["input"]
    output_grid = example["output"]
    print(f'{i=}')
    print(f'{np.array(input_grid).shape=}')
    print(f'{np.array(output_grid).shape=}')
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
