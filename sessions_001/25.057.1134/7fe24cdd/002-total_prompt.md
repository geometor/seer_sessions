## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 5 0
8 5 3
0 3 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CC2C950>

**output:**
```
8 5 0 0 8 8
8 5 3 3 5 5
0 3 2 2 3 0
0 3 2 2 3 0
5 5 3 3 5 8
8 8 0 0 5 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1CA46AD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors and their spatial relationships appear to be crucial. The output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input, with some kind of mirroring or reflection involved, and an increased number of elements. The black borders in the images are probably an artifact and not part of the data.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Input grid dimensions
      elements:  # Pixel values (colors)
        - [8, 5, 0]
        - [8, 5, 3]
        - [0, 3, 2]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6, 6]  # Output grid dimensions
      elements: # expanded elements
        - [8, 5, 0, 0, 8, 8]
        - [8, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5]
        - [0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0]
        - [0, 3, 2, 2, 3, 0]
        - [5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 8]
        - [8, 8, 0, 0, 5, 8]
actions:
 - name: expand
   description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
 - name: reflect
   description: some type of reflection or mirroring is happening.
relationships:
  - type: input-output
    description: The 3x3 grid transforms into the 6x6 grid.
  - type: spatial
    description:  The relative positions of colors within the grid are important to the transformation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Quadrant Duplication:** The original 3x3 grid is treated as the top-left quadrant of the output 6x6 grid. This quadrant is duplicated directly.

2.  **Horizontal Reflection:** The top-left quadrant is reflected horizontally to create the top-right quadrant. During reflection, the order within each row is mirrored from the original.

3.  **Vertical Reflection:** The top-left quadrant is reflected vertically to form the bottom-left quadrant. During reflection, the rows switch places compared to the original.

4.  **Diagonal Reflection (Top-Left to Bottom-Right):** The content of top-left is reflected across the diagonal line that goes from the upper-left to lower-right. The values from the top-left is transfered down to the bottom-right quadrant, with cell positions reflected with each other.

In summary, the input grid serves as a base, and a combination of duplications and horizontal, vertical, and diagonal reflections creates the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
