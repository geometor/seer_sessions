Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is expanded into a larger grid by replicating each pixel
to create 2x2 blocks. Then the output structure is formed by the original
cross and a mirrored structure

1.  **Initialization:** Create an empty 6x6 output grid.

2.  **Cross Replication:** For each cell (x, y) in the 3x3 input grid,
    copy its value to the output grid at positions: (x,y) and also add the
    original row and column to the output grid forming a cross.

3.  **Mirror:** Complete the output by mirroring each input pixel.
    specifically the output is the result of copying the input,
    interleaved with a 90-degree rotated copy of the input.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as 6x6 with zeros
    output_grid = np.zeros((6, 6), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the input grid
    for row in range(3):
        for col in range(3):
            # Copy each pixel value
            pixel_value = input_grid[row, col]

            # set 2x2 block in output
            output_grid[row * 2, col * 2] = pixel_value

            # mirror and rotate the input grid using the transposed pixel value
            output_grid[col * 2 + 1, row * 2 ] = pixel_value
            output_grid[col * 2 , row * 2 + 1] = pixel_value
            output_grid[row * 2 + 1, col * 2+1] = pixel_value


    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, which led to an oversimplified transformation rule. While the code correctly expands the input grid and replicates pixels in a 2x2 fashion, the "mirror and rotate" logic is incorrect and does not generalize across all examples. The core issue is that the transformation is not a simple mirror/rotation, but rather a more complex pattern of pixel replication and placement.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to how each input pixel maps to its corresponding output positions.
2.  **Identify Repeating Patterns:** Look for consistent rules in the pixel placement, not relying on assumptions like mirroring or rotation.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Describe the transformation with greater precision, focusing on the exact spatial relationships between input and output pixels.
4. **Test and iterate**: Re-test and adjust.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*Example Pair 1*
*   Input (3x3):
    ```
    [[1, 0, 2],
     [0, 3, 0],
     [4, 0, 5]]
    ```
*   Expected Output (6x6):
    ```
    [[1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2],
     [1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2],
     [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],
     [4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5],
     [4, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5]]
    ```
*   Actual Output (6x6): from previous code
    ```
   [[1. 0. 0. 3. 2. 0.]
    [0. 1. 3. 0. 0. 2.]
    [0. 3. 3. 0. 0. 5.]
    [3. 0. 0. 3. 5. 0.]
    [4. 0. 0. 5. 5. 0.]
    [0. 4. 5. 0. 0. 5.]]
```

*   **Observation:** The code correctly creates 2x2 blocks for each input pixel, however it gets the final placement wrong, likely due to an attempt to generalize a mirror and rotation transformation rule.

*Example Pair 2*
*   Input (3x3):
    ```
    [[6, 7, 0],
     [0, 8, 0],
     [9, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   Expected Output (6x6):
    ```
    [[6, 6, 7, 7, 0, 0],
     [6, 6, 7, 7, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],
     [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   Actual Output (6x6):
    ```
   [[6. 0. 7. 0. 0. 8.]
    [0. 6. 0. 7. 8. 0.]
    [0. 8. 8. 0. 0. 0.]
    [8. 0. 0. 8. 0. 0.]
    [9. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    [0. 9. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

```
*   **Observation:** Same behavior as example 1.

*Example Pair 3*
*   Input (3x3):
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [0, 1, 2]]
    ```
*   Expected Output (6x6):
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2],
     [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]]
    ```
*   Actual Output (6x6):
 ```
   [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
    [0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.]
    [0. 1. 0. 1. 2. 0.]
    [1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 2.]]
```
*   **Observation:** Same issue.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)

actions:
  - name: replicate_pixels
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is replicated to form a 2x2 block in the output grid.
    input: input_grid pixel
    output: 2x2 block in output_grid
    rule: >
      For each pixel at input_grid[row, col],
      output_grid[2*row, 2*col] = pixel value,
      output_grid[2*row + 1, 2*col] = pixel value,
      output_grid[2*row, 2*col + 1] = pixel value,
      output_grid[2*row + 1, 2*col + 1] = pixel value.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an empty 6x6 output grid filled with zeros.
2.  **Pixel Replication:** For every pixel in the 3x3 input grid, create a 2x2 block in the output grid. The value of the input pixel is copied to all four cells of the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid. The top-left corner of each 2x2 block corresponds to the position of the input pixel, scaled by a factor of 2 in both row and column indices. Specifically, if an input pixel is at `input_grid[row, col]`, the corresponding 2x2 block in the output grid will have its top-left corner at `output_grid[2*row, 2*col]`.

The "mirror and rotate" section of the original is removed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
