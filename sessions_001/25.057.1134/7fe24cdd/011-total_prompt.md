Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output grid is constructed as a 2x2 arrangement, where each section (quadrant) is a reflected version of the input grid.

1.  **Top-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is identical to the input grid. No transformation is applied.

2.  **Top-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is a horizontally reflected copy of the input grid. The input is mirrored along its vertical axis.

3.  **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** This quadrant is a vertically reflected copy of the input grid. The input is mirrored along its horizontal axis.

4.  **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** This quadrant is both horizontally and vertically reflected, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation of the input grid. The input is mirrored along both its vertical and horizontal axes.

The output grid's dimensions are always double the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
