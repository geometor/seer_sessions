The colors present are white (0), green (3), and magenta (6). The transformation appears to be a form of expansion or replication, where each pixel in the input grid is somehow influencing a larger area in the output grid. The spatial relationships between the colors in the input seem to be preserved, but also altered, in the output. The output grid appears to interweave the input grid with a mirrored/rotated version of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
