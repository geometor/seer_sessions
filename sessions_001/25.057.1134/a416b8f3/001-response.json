The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid that is double the width. The pattern of the input grid seems to be replicated horizontally in the output. The colors (represented by numbers) are maintained during the transformation. The height of grid stays the same.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
