Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to crop the input grid to a 3x3 area at the bottom right.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts the 3x3 subgrid from the lower-right corner of the input grid.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier slicing
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # Get the dimensions of the input array
    rows, cols = input_array.shape
    
    # Calculate the starting indices for the 3x3 subgrid
    start_row = rows - 3
    start_col = cols - 3
    
    # Extract the 3x3 subgrid using array slicing
    output_array = input_array[start_row:rows, start_col:cols]
    
    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
