Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is vertically divided into three equal sections. One of these sections is selected to form the output grid. The selection criteria is based on the example number: the first example takes the top section, the second the middle, and the third the bottom.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid, example_number):
    # Initialize output_grid (it will just be a subset of input in this case so no need)
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    height = input_grid.shape[0]
    subgrid_height = height // 3
    
    # Determine the section to extract based on the example number.
    if example_number == 1:
        start_row = 0
    elif example_number == 2:
        start_row = subgrid_height
    elif example_number == 3:
        start_row = 2 * subgrid_height
    else:  # Should not happen in training, but good practice to have.
        start_row = 0 # Default to the first section.

    # Extract the selected subgrid
    output_grid = input_grid[start_row:start_row + subgrid_height, :]

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
