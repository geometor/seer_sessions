Previous Code:
```python
"""

    """
    # Convert input grid to a NumPy array for easier slicing.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Determine the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_array.shape

    # Define start and end indices for rows and columns of subgrid
    start_row = 3

    start_col = 0
    end_col = 3

    # Extract the subgrid using array slicing.

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial `transform` function against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly extracted a 3x3 subgrid. However, it's clear from the other training examples that this is not the complete transformation. The subgrid extraction location and potentially other operations are dependent on the input. The provided code always extracts the same 3x3 subgrid, starting from row 4. This is not correct for all input examples. Therefore, we need a more dynamic approach that correctly identifies the section of the input to use for the output. The core concept seems to be extracting a subgrid, and possibly one that is identified by the location of specific colors/objects.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, focusing on identifying corresponding regions or objects. Look for patterns in the colors and spatial relationships. Determine what information needs to computed to correctly select the bounds of the subgrid.
2.  **Gather Metrics:** Calculate sizes, colors, and positions of relevant features in both input and output grids. Use code execution where needed.
3.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML block with detailed observations, properties, and relationships.
4.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Based on the updated observations, create a more general and accurate natural language program that describes the transformation rule. Focus on making it adaptive to different inputs.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, along with metrics gathered using observation and code execution:

**Example 1**

*   **Input:** 9x9, Contains a 3x3 green square at (3,0).
*   **Output:** 3x3 green square.
*   Result: Correct.

```python
# code execution metrics for example 1
import numpy as np

input_grid = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output_grid = [[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]]

input_array = np.array(input_grid)
output_array = np.array(output_grid)
print(f"Input shape: {input_array.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output_array.shape}")

#find the green square
green_indices = np.where(input_array == 3)
min_row, min_col = np.min(green_indices, axis=1)
max_row, max_col = np.max(green_indices, axis=1)

print(f"Green square: Top-left: ({min_row},{min_col}), Bottom-right: ({max_row},{max_col})")
```

```
Input shape: (9, 9)
Output shape: (3, 3)
Green square: Top-left: (3,0), Bottom-right: (5,2)
```

**Example 2**

*   **Input:** 7x11, Contains a 3x3 yellow square at (4,4).
*   **Output:** 3x3 yellow square.
*   Result: Incorrect. The code extracts a subgrid starting at row 3, not row 4.

```python
# code execution metrics for example 2
import numpy as np
input_grid = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output_grid = [[4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4]]

input_array = np.array(input_grid)
output_array = np.array(output_grid)
print(f"Input shape: {input_array.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output_array.shape}")

#find the yellow square
yellow_indices = np.where(input_array == 4)
min_row, min_col = np.min(yellow_indices, axis=1)
max_row, max_col = np.max(yellow_indices, axis=1)
print(f"Yellow square: Top-left: ({min_row},{min_col}), Bottom-right: ({max_row},{max_col})")
```

```
Input shape: (7, 11)
Output shape: (3, 3)
Yellow square: Top-left: (4,4), Bottom-right: (6,6)
```

**Example 3**

*   **Input:** 9x9, Contains a 3x3 blue square at (0,6).
*   **Output:** 3x3 blue square.
*   Result: Incorrect. The code extracts a subgrid from the wrong location.

```python
# code execution metrics for example 3
import numpy as np

input_grid = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
output_grid = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]

input_array = np.array(input_grid)
output_array = np.array(output_grid)
print(f"Input shape: {input_array.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output_array.shape}")

blue_indices = np.where(input_array == 1)
min_row, min_col = np.min(blue_indices, axis=1)
max_row, max_col = np.max(blue_indices, axis=1)

print(f"Blue square: Top-left: ({min_row},{min_col}), Bottom-right: ({max_row},{max_col})")
```

```
Input shape: (9, 9)
Output shape: (3, 3)
Blue square: Top-left: (0,6), Bottom-right: (2,8)
```

**YAML Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: 3bd67252
    examples:
      - example_id: 1
        input_objects:
          - object_id: 1
            color: green
            shape: square
            size: 3x3
            top_left: [3, 0]
        output_objects:
          - object_id: 1
            color: green
            shape: square
            size: 3x3

      - example_id: 2
        input_objects:
          - object_id: 1
            color: yellow
            shape: square
            size: 3x3
            top_left: [ 4, 4 ]
        output_objects:
          - object_id: 1
            color: yellow
            shape: square
            size: 3x3

      - example_id: 3
        input_objects:
          - object_id: 1
            color: blue
            shape: square
            size: 3x3
            top_left: [ 0, 6 ]
        output_objects:
          - object_id: 1
            color: blue
            shape: square
            size: 3x3

    general_rule: "The output is a 3x3 square subgrid extracted from the input grid. The subgrid corresponds to the location of the single 3x3 colored square found in the input. If multiple 3x3 colored square of different colors are present, only one is used as a rule, based on training set order. Other colored squares and variations can be ignored"
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Target Square:** Find the 3x3 square object within the input grid. Consider the colors in the order of the examples: green, yellow, blue.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Once the 3x3 square is located, extract the subgrid corresponding to its location. The top-left corner of the subgrid in the output will be the same as the top-left corner of the 3x3 square in the input.
3.  **Output:** The output is the extracted 3x3 subgrid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
