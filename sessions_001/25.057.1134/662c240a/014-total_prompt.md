## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 2 3
2 3 3
5 7 7
7 5 5
7 5 5
8 8 1
1 8 1
1 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x74AF1C9ED750>

**output:**
```
8 8 1
1 8 1
1 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9ECE50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into another grid of colored pixels. The output grid appears to be a subset of the input grid, specifically the bottom-right 3x3 sub-grid. The colors and their positions within this 3x3 section are preserved.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (input: 9x3, output: 3x3)
      - elements: colored pixels (represented by integers)
    actions:
      - select_subgrid
    relationships:
      - input_contains_output: Output is a sub-region of the input.

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer_value (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
    actions:
      - retain_color
      - retain_relative_position
    relationships:
      - part_of: Belongs to a grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Sub-grid:** Locate the 3x3 sub-grid at the bottom-right corner of the input grid.
2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Copy the colors and relative positions of the pixels within this 3x3 sub-grid.
3. **Construct Output:** use the copied part from the sub grid to create the output grid

In essence, the transformation rule is to extract the bottom-right 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid and present it as the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
