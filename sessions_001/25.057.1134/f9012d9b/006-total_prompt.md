Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code extracts the top-left 2x2 subgrid from the input. This works correctly for the first training example, but it will fail for other examples where the transformation logic is different. The core issue is that the current program is *too specific* to the first example and doesn't generalize. We need to analyze *all* training examples to discern the *actual* underlying rule. The strategy is to:

1.  **Examine all examples:** Carefully look at each input-output pair in the training set.
2.  **Identify the common pattern:** Determine what transformation is consistently applied across *all* examples, not just the first.
3.  **Revise the natural language program:** Describe the generalized rule accurately and completely.
4.  Prepare the data to hand off to the coder phase.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**

Since I don't have direct code execution capabilities here, I will describe the observations as if I had executed the code and analyzed the input/output pairs, and the predicted output.

```
# this would be the code I would execute to provide metrics
# I will describe the output in the reports below

```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is simply: **The output grid is identical to the input grid.**  No changes are made to the dimensions or pixel values. The previous code, which extracted a 2x2 subgrid, is incorrect for this task.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
