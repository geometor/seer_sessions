## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 6 0 6
6 8 6 8
8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x74AF1CAD3250>

**output:**
```
8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x74AF1C9AE3D0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 4x4 grid containing the digits 8, 6, and 0. The colors alternate in a checkerboard pattern between azure (8) and magenta (6), with a single white (0) cell.
*   **Output:** A 1x1 grid containing the single digit 8, colored azure.
*   The input grid has a checkerboard pattern. It suggests a possible simplification or reduction based on a dominant color or number.
*   The single white '0' seems not significant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 4x4
      output: 1x1
    elements:
      input: [8, 6, 0]
      output: [8]
    properties:
        input_pattern: checkerboard
        dominant_color_input: azure(8),magenta(6)
        dominant_color_output: azure(8)

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Select a single value from the input grid.
    criteria: most frequent value of the repeated colors

relationships:
  - type: dominance
    description: The output value (8) is the numerically larger of the two numbers in the repeating checkerboard pattern in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Repeating Pattern:** Observe the input grid and note the two colors/numbers that constitute the repeating pattern (in this case, 8 and 6, azure and magenta).
2.  **Select Dominant Value:** Ignore outlier values (like the single 0), and determine the numerically higher value in the repeating pattern.
3.  **Output:** Create a 1x1 grid containing only the selected value, with the corresponding color. In other words find the numerically highest number in the input checkerboard pattern. Output it.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
