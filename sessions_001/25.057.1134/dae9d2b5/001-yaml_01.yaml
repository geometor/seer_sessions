facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are grids of integers representing colored pixels.
  - dimensions:
      input: 3x6
      output: 3x6
    note: Dimensions remain consistent.
  - input_colors:
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
      - color: green
        value: 3
      - color: white

        value: 0
  - transformation:
      type: color_replacement
      rule: "Yellow (4) and Green (3) are each replaced with Magenta (6)"
  - spatial_relationship:
      description: The relative positions of the pixels remain unchanged. The transformation is a direct color mapping at each position.
