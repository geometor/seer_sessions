The input grid appears to have a pattern involving yellow (4), green (3), and white (0) pixels, while the output grid has magenta (6) and white (0) pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain consistent (3x6 in this example). It seems the transformation involves replacing specific colors based on some underlying rule, and the positions relative to each other.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
