## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB81150>

**output:**
```
8 8 8
8 0 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C88FED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid consists entirely of '0' values, representing the color white. The output grid retains the central '0' but surrounds it with '8' values, corresponding to the color azure. The transformation seems to involve a change of color based on the position of the pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            8: azure

observations:
  - input:
      grid: all pixels are 0 (white)
  - output:
      grid:
        - central pixel remains 0 (white)
        - surrounding pixels become 8 (azure)

actions:
  - change_color:
      condition: pixel is not in the center
      new_color: 8 (azure)

relationships:
  - spatial: center pixel vs. surrounding pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the center pixel:** In a 3x3 grid, this is the pixel at row 2, column 2.
2.  **Preserve the center pixel:**  The color of the center pixel remains unchanged (value '0', color white).
3.  **Change surrounding pixel colors:** All pixels *other than* the center pixel are changed to color '8' (azure).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
