and change the color of all surrounding pixels to 8 (azure).

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with updated observations and a natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies 3x3 subgrids and modifies the surrounding pixels while preserving the center pixel. However, it fails to account for a crucial condition present in the examples: the rule is only applied to 3x3 subgrids that are *entirely* filled with the *same* non-zero color. The current code applies the transformation to *any* 3x3 subgrid, regardless of the colors of its constituent pixels. The strategy to resolve the errors will involve adding a check within the nested loops to ensure that the 3x3 subgrid is homogeneous (all pixels same color) and that the color is not black(0) before applying the transformation.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations about discrepancies between the predicted and expected outputs. Because of how results are presented, I can't programmatically process it, however, I can derive a lot of information, so I am including example specific comments.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 6x6 grid, a single yellow (4) 3x3 square.
    *   Expected Output: Center pixel yellow (4), surrounding pixels azure (8).
    *   Actual Output: Matches expected.
        *Comments: This is the example used to produce the initial code.*

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid, multiple overlapping and non-overlapping 3x3 squares of various colors.
    *   Expected Output: Only homogeneous, non-black 3x3 squares transformed.
    *   Actual Output: Transforms all 3x3 subgrids, regardless of homogeneity.
        *Comments: Clearly shows the code's over-application of the rule.*

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 11x11 grid with various shapes and colors, including a single 3x3 red square, and 2x2 squares.
    *   Expected Output: Only the 3x3 red square transformed.
    *   Actual Output: Transforms all 3x3 subgrids, including those formed by the 2x2 squares and background, which is incorrect.
        *Comments: Highlights the need for a homogeneity check and background color exclusion.*
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: Contains multiple solid-color, non-black 3x3 regions.
    *   Expected: Each of these are transformed
    *   Actual: Transforms all 3x3 regions.
        *Comments: Over-applies rule.*
*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input: Contains no 3x3 regions
    *   Expected: No change
    *   Actual: No change
        *Comments: No action is the correct response.*

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: 3x3_subgrid
    properties:
      - homogeneity: True  # All pixels within the subgrid have the same color.
      - center_pixel: Unchanged # The color of the center pixel of a subgrid must match original
      - surrounding_pixels: 8  # If homogeneity is true, surrounding pixels are changed to color 8 (azure).
      - background_color: 0 # black/0 is not transformed
    actions:
      - transform: |
          If a 3x3 subgrid is homogeneous and is not black, change the color of all pixels except
          the center pixel to 8 (azure).
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, up to 30x30
    actions: []

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify 3x3 Subgrids:** Iterate through the input grid, considering each pixel as the potential top-left corner of a 3x3 subgrid.
2.  **Homogeneity Check:** For each 3x3 subgrid, check if all pixels within the subgrid have the same color and the color is not black (0).
3.  **Conditional Transformation:** If and only if the subgrid is homogeneous and not black, change the color of the eight pixels *surrounding* the center pixel to azure (8). The center pixel retains its original color.
4.  **Output:** The transformed grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
