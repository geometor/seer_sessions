Previous Code:
```python
"""
Start with a 4x4 input grid containing pixels of colors white (0) and green (3).
All white (0) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
All of the green pixels, except the pixel in the top right corner, are changed to azure (8).
top right green (3) pixel is unchaged.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape
    
    # Find the top right corner coordinates
    top_right_corner = (0, cols - 1)

    # Iterate through each cell of the grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):

            if input_grid[i, j] == 0:
                continue  # White pixels remain unchanged
            # Change green (3) to azure (8) except at top right corner

                if (i, j) != top_right_corner:

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program and observations.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which led to an oversimplification. The code correctly handles white pixels and changes most green pixels to azure, except for the top-right green pixel. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule isn't universally true. The top-right green pixel is not *always* preserved. A more nuanced rule governing which green pixels change to azure is needed, and which are preserved. We need to consider other geometric properties or spatial relationships. I noticed that it may not have to do with the "top right" but perhaps about the contiguity of the green pixels.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand the pattern, let's analyze each example, noting:

*   Grid size
*   Number of green pixels
*   Location of green pixels that remain green
*   Location of green pixels that change to azure

I will generate these metrics, and use them to structure my YAML and natural language update.

import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    grid_size = input_grid.shape
    green_pixels = np.sum(input_grid == 3)
    unchanged_green_pixels = np.sum((input_grid == 3) & (output_grid == 3))
    changed_green_pixels = np.sum((input_grid == 3) & (output_grid == 8))
    
    unchanged_green_coords = []
    changed_green_coords = []
    for r in range(grid_size[0]):
        for c in range(grid_size[1]):
            if input_grid[r,c] == 3 and output_grid[r,c] == 3:
                unchanged_green_coords.append((r,c))
            if input_grid[r,c] == 3 and output_grid[r,c] == 8:
                changed_green_coords.append((r,c))

    return {
        "grid_size": grid_size,
        "green_pixels": green_pixels,

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
