## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 0
0 3 0
3 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1C9ADD50>

**output:**
```
8 8 0
0 8 0
3 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CB81150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.  Each integer represents a color. The transformation appears to selectively change some of the integers/colors based on their initial value and possibly their position, while leaving others unchanged. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. Specifically, green (3) seems to become azure (8), unless a part of the edge.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: input and output grids have identical dimensions
  - transformation:
      type: color change
      details:
        - original_color: 3 (green)
          new_color: 8 (azure)
          condition: "if not on the edge"
        - original_color: 0 (white)
          new_color: 0 (white)
          condition: "always"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the value (color) of the current cell.
3.  **If** cell is at edge, then do nothing.
4.  **If** the cell's value is 3 (green), **change** it to 8 (azure).
5.  **Otherwise, keep** the cell's original value.
6. **Output** is new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
