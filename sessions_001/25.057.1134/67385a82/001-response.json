Each integer represents a color. The transformation appears to selectively change some of the integers/colors based on their initial value and possibly their position, while leaving others unchanged. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. Specifically, green (3) seems to become azure (8), unless a part of the edge.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
