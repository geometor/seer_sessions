## Example 4

**input:**
```
3 3 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 0 0
0 3 3 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x320 at 0x74AF1CC2F6D0>

**output:**
```
8 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x320 at 0x74AF1CC2C950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved appear to be green (3) and white (0), with the output introducing azure (8). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of color based on location and possibly adjacency.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 5
      columns: 6
      cells:
        - value: 0-9 # Represents color codes
          properties:
            color:  # Refer to COLOR_MAP in instructions
            position: (row, col)

  - type: color_block
    properties:
      color: int
      shape: contiguous region

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Change the color of a cell based on a rule.
    parameters:
      original_color: int
      new_color: int
      condition:  # To be determined (e.g., position, adjacency)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Cells sharing a side or corner.
    between: [cell, cell]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels with the color green (value 3).
2.  **Conditional Replacement:**
   *   If a green pixel is in the top-left corner of the original image (0,0), it gets replaced with azure (8).
    *  If two green pixels are horizontally adjacent to each other, both the pixels are changed to azure (8).
   *   Green pixels in the first two columns get replaced with azure(8).
3.  **Preserve:** All other pixels, including the zeros (white), remain unchanged.

Essentially all green colored pixels that form a horizontal contiguous segment of length greater than or equals to 2, get replaced by color azure. Remaining green pixels, and pixels of other colors are not touched.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
