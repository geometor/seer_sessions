## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1C675350>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
2 2 2 2 4 2
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit (0-9), representing different colors. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (6x6 in this case). There are distinct colored regions (objects) in both input and output. The transformation seems to involve extending existing objects and potentially creating new ones based on spatial relationships.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and Output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains two distinct objects:
        - A horizontal line of two red (2) pixels on the left side of the third row.
        - A vertical line of two azure (8) pixels in the fifth column, covering first two rows.
  - observation: |
    The azure object remains unchanged and in the same position.
  - observation: |
      The red object in the input extends to the right until it meets the vertical azure object.
  - observation: |
    A single yellow pixel is in the output where red and azure meet.
  - observation: |
    The areas without change keep 0 value pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous colored regions (objects) in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Unchanged Objects:** Copy any objects from input that do not interact with other to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and colors. In this case, the vertical azure (8) object.
3. **Horizontal Extension**: Extend the identified horizontal object, if any, to the right.
4. **Meeting Point:** The extending stops when it encounters an object.
5. **New Object Creation:** When extension stops, a yellow (4) is created on the extended object's last position
6.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with the default value of 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
