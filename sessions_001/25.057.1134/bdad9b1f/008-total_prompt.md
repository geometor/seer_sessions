## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1CC2C950>

**output:**
```
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
2 4 2 2 2 2
0 8 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x74AF1CB81150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains two distinct colored objects: an azure (8) object in the top left and a red (2) object in the middle right. The output grid introduces changes: the azure object appears to have expanded downwards, and the red object has expanded to the left and right, with a new yellow (4) pixel appearing in the center of the expanded red object. The background remains white (0).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: top_left
    shape: vertical_line
    action: extend_downward
  - id: 2
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: middle_right
    shape: horizontal_line
    action: extend_left_right_with_center
  - id: 3
    color: 'yellow (4)'
    initial_position: center_of_red
    shape: single_pixel
    action: appears in center of expanded red
  - id: 4
    color: 'white (0)'
    initial_position: background
    shape: 'fill'
    action: no change

relationships:
  - object1: 1
    object2: 2
    relation: independent_movement, different_rules
  - object1: 2
    object2: 3
      relation: 3 appears inside extended area of 2

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Azure Object Extension:** The azure (8) object, initially a vertical line of two pixels, extends downwards. The final length of the azure object occupies available space.

2.  **Red Object Expansion and Modification:** The red (2) object, initially a horizontal line of two pixels, expands. A single yellow (4) pixel is inserted into the center of the red object. The red object is then extended to the left and right edges of the grid.

3.  **Background:** Pixels that are not part of the azure or red objects remain white/background (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
