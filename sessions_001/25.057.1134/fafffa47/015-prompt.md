Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color maroon (9) in the input grid.
2.  **Replace** the color of these identified pixels with red (2).
3. **Remove** all blue pixels and some white pixels to get a compressed 3x3 grid. There are two maroon colored objects on the top left. The transformation seems to be taking the 3x3 area of the grid that starts on the top left and contains those two original maroon colored objects, and substituting the color of those objects.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a 3x3 numpy array filled with zeros (white)
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the top-left 3x3 region of the input grid
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            # Check if the current pixel is maroon (9)
            if input_grid[i, j] == 9:
                # Replace maroon (9) with red (2) in the output grid
                output_grid[i, j] = 2
            else:
                output_grid[i,j] = input_grid[i,j]

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
