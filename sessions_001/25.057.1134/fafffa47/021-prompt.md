Previous Code:
```python
"""
Divide the input grid (6x3) into nine 2x1 regions. Consider them as cells of a 3x3 grid.
The order of the 2x1 blocks are read from left to right, top to bottom. The first 2x1 block is the top left block, etc.
Inspect each of these 2x1 regions:
    *   If any of them contains a maroon (9) pixel, and zero blue (1), output a red (2) pixel in the corresponding position of the output grid.
    *   If not, output a white (0) pixel in the corresponding position of the output grid.
"""

    """
    Transforms a 6x3 input grid into a 3x3 output grid based on the presence of maroon (9)
    and the absence of blue(1) in 2x1 regions of the input.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
