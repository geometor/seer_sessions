The first one is maroon (9) and blue (1) colored pixels. The output is a 3x3 grid, smaller than the input, and focuses on representing a simplified version related to the maroon object, now represented with red(2) color. It appears that one of the input objects (maroon) is extracted and simplified, while the other input (blue) object is completely removed. The background remains the same, white(0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
