    description: Converts maroon pixels in input to red pixels in output, determining output size.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rules:
      - rule_1:  The output grid appears to represent a scaled down view of the
                 position of the first maroon pixel.
      - rule_2: Maroon pixels are changed to red.
      - rule_3: Other maroon pixels are eliminated.
