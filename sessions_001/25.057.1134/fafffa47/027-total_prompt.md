Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct objects within the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels with value other than 0.
2.  **Select Target Object:** Select the maroon (9) object.
3.  **Remove other objects:** The blue object is discarded.
4.  **Reduce Grid Size:** Create a new 3x3 output grid.
5.  **Simplify and Reposition Selected Object**: If in the original image, at least one pixel of the selected object appears on the first row in any of the three leftmost, or three rightmost pixels. Place a red pixel in the output grid at [0,0] if any of the three leftmost pixels is part of the object, and another pixel in the [0,2] position if any of the rightmost three pixel is part of the object.
6.  **Fill Background:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
