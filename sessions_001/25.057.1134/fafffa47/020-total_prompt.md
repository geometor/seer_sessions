## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 9
9 9 9
0 9 0
1 0 0
0 1 1
0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x74AF1CB17750>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
0 0 0
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74AF1CAD3BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (6x3) into a smaller grid (3x3). The colors in the input grid are white, maroon, and blue. The output grid contains only white and red. It seems like specific regions of the input grid are being summarized or represented in the output grid. The output grid appears to capture a specific color from the input grid, focusing on maroon.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 6x3
    elements: [0, 9, 1] # white, maroon, blue

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 2] # white, red

actions:
  - type: summarize_region
    agent: unknown
    input: 2x1 region of input_grid
    output: single pixel in output_grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial_mapping
    description: Each 2x1 region in the input grid maps to one cell in the output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid (6x3) into nine 2x1 regions. Consider them as cells of a 3x3 grid.
2. **Define:** The order of the 2x1 blocks are read from left to right, top to bottom. The first 2x1 block is the top left block, etc.
3.  **Inspect:** Check each of these 2x1 regions:
    *   If any of them contains a maroon (9) pixel, and zero blue (1), output a red (2) pixel in the corresponding position of the output grid.
    *   If not, output a white (0) pixel in the corresponding position of the output grid.

In essence, the program checks for the presence of maroon color in specific 2x1 regions of the input and represents those regions with red in the output. If no maroon is in that section it is white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
