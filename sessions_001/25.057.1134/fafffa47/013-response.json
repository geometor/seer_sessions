The input grid contains three colors: white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid contains two colors: white (0) and red (2). It appears the transformation involves some form of object extraction and color replacement. Specifically, maroon (9) pixels are replaced by red (2), and blue (1) pixels, along with some white (0) pixels, disappear, resulting in a smaller grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
