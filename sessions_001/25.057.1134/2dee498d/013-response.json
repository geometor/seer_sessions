The input grid appears to be wider than the output grid. The colors and their corresponding numerical values are consistent with the provided `COLOR_MAP`. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the width of the grid, specifically collapsing or selecting columns.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
