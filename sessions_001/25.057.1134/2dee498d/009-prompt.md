Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed into the output grid by removing every third column. Iterate through the input grid's columns. Keep the first two, remove the third and repeat until all rows are complete. The output contains same rows, but only with a subset of the original columns.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as an empty list.
    output_grid = []

    # Get the number of rows and columns in the input grid.
    num_rows = len(input_grid)
    num_cols = len(input_grid[0])

    # Iterate through the columns of the input grid, selecting every column except every third one.
    col_index = 0
    while col_index < num_cols:
        if (col_index + 1) % 3 != 0:  # Keep columns if they're not the third, sixth, ninth, etc
          for row_index in range(num_rows):
            if len(output_grid) <= row_index:
              output_grid.append([])

        col_index += 1

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
