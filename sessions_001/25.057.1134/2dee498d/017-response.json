            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the hypothesis that the output grid consists of the leftmost columns of the input grid, with the number of columns determined by the minimal width containing all unique colors. This hypothesis holds true for the first training example, but fails for others. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't solely based on unique colors and leftmost columns. The examples suggest a more complex rule that involves identifying a specific pattern or object within the input, and the relation of other colors and objects to that one. We will need to change the \"story\" of how to determine the output.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair closely, paying attention to not just unique colors but also shapes, patterns, and relative positions of colors/objects.\n2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, reformulate the hypothesis about the transformation rule. It's likely that the rule will involve identifying a recurring element or pattern.\n3.  **Natural Language Program Update:**  Rewrite the natural language program to reflect the refined hypothesis.\n4.  **Iterative Process**: This might have to be iterative.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example by Example):**\n\nI will describe observations and metrics.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** 6x5 grid with colors: blue, red, green, yellow.\n*   **Output:** 2x5 grid with colors: blue, red, green, yellow.\n*   **Code Result:** Correct. The first two columns contain all unique colors.\n*    Metrics:\n    - Input Shape: 6x5\n    - Output Shape: 2x5\n    - Unique Input Colors: 4 (blue, red, green, yellow)\n    - Unique Output Colors: 4\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** 9x9 grid with colors including green and black.\n*   **Output:** 3x9 grid containing vertical stripes, each stripe is one pixel of green followed by one pixel of black.\n*   **Code Result:** Incorrect. The code likely extracts more than 3 columns because it's searching for *all* unique colors, not just identifying the repeating green-black pattern.\n*   Metrics:\n    - Input Shape: 9x9\n    - Output Shape: 3x9\n    - Unique Input Colors: At least 2.\n    - Unique Output Colors: 2 (green, black)\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** 11x11 grid with colors including gray and green.\n*   **Output:** 4x11 grid with a gray, green, gray, green pattern in the top-left corner.\n*   **Code Result:** Incorrect.  Similar to Example 2, the logic of finding all unique colors will not produce the correct output. It seems like a repeating pattern extraction is the transformation.\n*   Metrics:\n    - Input Shape: 11x11\n    - Output Shape: 4x11\n    - Unique Input Colors: >2\n    - Unique Output Colors: 2 (gray, green).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: 6x5\n      output_shape: 2x5\n      unique_input_colors: [blue, red, green, yellow]\n      unique_output_colors: [blue, red, green, yellow]\n      transformation: \"extract_leftmost_columns_until_all_colors_present\"\n      code_result: correct\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: 9x9\n      output_shape: 3x9\n      unique_input_colors: \"more than 2\"\n      unique_output_colors: [green, black]\n      transformation: \"extract_repeating_pattern_green_black\"\n      code_result: incorrect\n  - example_3:\n      input_shape: 11x11\n      output_shape: 4x11\n      unique_input_colors: \"more than 2\"\n      unique_output_colors: [gray, green]\n      transformation: \"extract_repeating_pattern_gray_green\"\n      code_result: incorrect\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised):**\n\nThe transformation identifies and extracts a repeating vertical pattern from the input grid. In each output example this repeating pattern is two pixels wide:\n\n1.  Examine the input grid.\n2.  Identify the smallest repeating vertical pattern, two pixels wide, starting from the top left corner.\n3.  Extract this pattern to create the output grid. The output has same number of rows.\n\nThis revised natural language program focuses on pattern extraction, which seems to be the common thread among the examples. The previous program's reliance on *all* unique colors is incorrect.\n"
