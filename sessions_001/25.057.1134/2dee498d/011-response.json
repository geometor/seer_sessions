            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were too specific, focusing solely on retaining columns containing black pixels. While this worked for the first training example, it failed for subsequent examples where the presence of black was irrelevant. The core issue is an over-generalization from a single example. The updated strategy needs to identify a transformation rule that consistently applies across *all* provided examples. We need to shift from focusing on specific colors to discerning a more general pattern of column selection.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1. **Broaden Observation:** Instead of fixating on black pixels, we'll analyze the *relationship* between input and output columns across all examples. This involves looking for patterns in which columns are kept or discarded, regardless of their specific color content.\n\n2. **Identify Common Rule:** The goal is to find a rule for column selection that holds true for all training examples. This rule might involve:\n   - Column indices (e.g., keeping every other column).\n   - Column content comparison (e.g., keeping columns identical to the first column).\n   - Column properties (e.g., keeping columns with a specific sum or a specific color at a specific index).\n\n3. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Once a consistent rule is identified, the natural language program will be updated to describe this general rule accurately.\n\n4. **Iterate:** The process of refining the natural language program will continue until the rule covers all the train set examples.\n\n**Example and Results Metrics:**\n\nTo understand which columns are kept and discarded in a structured way, let's define some metrics and collect them. The most crucial metric is whether a column is present in the output and, if so, what its original index was in the input. We can get this using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_column_inclusion(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which columns from the input grid are present in the output grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid as a 2D list or numpy array.\n        output_grid: The output grid as a 2D list or numpy array.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary where keys are column indices from the input grid,\n        and values are booleans indicating if the column is present in\n        the output grid.  Also prints analysis to the console.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)\n\n    input_cols = input_grid.shape[1]\n    output_cols = output_grid.shape[1]\n\n    print(f\"Input grid shape: {input_grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"Output grid shape: {output_grid.shape}\")\n\n    column_inclusion = {}\n\n    for i in range(input_cols):\n        input_col = input_grid[:, i]\n        is_present = False\n        for j in range(output_cols):\n            output_col = output_grid[:, j]\n            if np.array_equal(input_col, output_col):\n                is_present = True\n                break\n        column_inclusion[i] = is_present\n        print(f\"Column {i} from input present in output: {is_present}\")\n\n    return column_inclusion\n```\nNow use the code to analyze each example.\n\n```tool_code\ntasks = [\n    {\n        \"train\": [\n            {\n                \"input\": [[5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5]],\n                \"output\": [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]\n            },\n            {\n                \"input\": [[1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]],\n                \"output\": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n            },\n            {\n                \"input\": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]],\n                \"output\": [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n            },\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\nfor task in tasks:\n    for example in task['train']:\n        input_grid = example['input']\n        output_grid = example['output']\n        print(f\"--- Analyzing Example ---\")\n        analyze_column_inclusion(input_grid, output_grid)\n\n```"
