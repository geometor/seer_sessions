The input grid appears to be a larger, more detailed version of the output grid. The output grid seems to be a simplified or \"compressed\" version of the input, retaining only a subset of the original pixels and potentially reducing the overall dimensions. The core transformation seems to involve a reduction in both the number of columns and the overall size of the grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The new output will only contain every third column starting from the first column.\n3. **Pixel Selection/Retention:** Create the output grid, which has the same number of rows as the input grid. Fill the output grid by taking the values from the selected columns in step 2. Specifically the columns that will be used from input are column 0, column 3, and column 6.\n4. **Output:** The resulting, smaller grid is the output.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation extracts every third column from the input grid, starting with the first column, and uses those to create a new, smaller grid. The row count does not change.\n"
