  - observation: column_correspondence
    description: Input columns map to output columns in some transformed way.
  - observation: vertical_expansion
    description: The output grid is taller than the input grid. The height increases by 2 rows.
  - observation: value_substitution.
      description: "values in the input are transformed, where 1 remains 1, 2 remains 2, and 8 remains 8. The transformation process creates additional rows of 0, with the number of 0 rows corresponding to the height difference (output_height - input_height), for example: if azure (8) present in a column, then it becomes the top value, followed by equal values of 0."
