examples:
  - example_id: 1

    correct: true
    observations: |
      Input height is doubled.
      Colors are transferred from input to output column-wise.
      output rows = input rows * 2.

  - example_id: 2
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [4, 3]
    correct: false
    observations: |
      Output height is not double the input height.
      Color 2 appears at the top of each output column.
      The other colors in the input columns are preserved in order,
      but shifted down by one row in the output.
      output rows = input rows + 1.

  - example_id: 3
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [5, 3]
    correct: false
    observations: |
      Output height is not double the input height.
      Color 2 appears at the top of each output column.
      The other colors from the input columns appear to have been shifted downwards.
      output rows = input rows + 2
