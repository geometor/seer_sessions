Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a 4x3 input grid into a 6x3 output grid. Each column in the input
is transformed independently. The transformation involves reordering and
adding zeros. 
- Input column is copied to the output.
- Two additional '0' values are appended to each column.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows + 2, cols), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through each column of the input grid
    for j in range(cols):
        # Extract the current column
        input_column = input_grid[:, j]

        # Transform the column
        output_column = np.concatenate([input_column, [0, 0]])

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
