## Example 4

**input:**
```
1 1 1
2 2 1
2 8 1
2 8 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x74AF1CAD06D0>

**output:**
```
1 2 8
1 2 8
1 2 0
1 2 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x74AF1CAD3150>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 4x3 grid of single-digit integers (colors). The colors present are blue (1), red (2), and azure (8).
*   **Output Grid:** A 6x3 grid, also of single-digit integers. The colors are the same as the input, with white(0) added.
*  The layout appears significant. There's a clear vertical structure, and columns seem important.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x3
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: red
        value: 2
      - color: azure
        value: 8
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x3
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: red
        value: 2
      - color: azure
        value: 8
      - color: white
        value: 0
  - observation: column_correspondence
    description: Input columns map to output columns in some transformed way.
  - observation: vertical_expansion
    description: The output grid is taller than the input grid. The height increases by 2 rows.
  - observation: value_substitution.
      description: "values in the input are transformed, where 1 remains 1, 2 remains 2, and 8 remains 8. The transformation process creates additional rows of 0, with the number of 0 rows corresponding to the height difference (output_height - input_height), for example: if azure (8) present in a column, then it becomes the top value, followed by equal values of 0."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each column of the input grid.
2.  **Transform Each Column:** For each input column, create a new column in the output grid.
    *   Copy each input column to output, but stack vertically, with value 8 at the top.
    *   The number of output rows for each color is determined by checking the input colors and stacking them vertically: If there is any 8, put 8 on the top.
3.  **Fill with Zeroes:** after the transformation, the height of the grid is extended by two rows, by adding two zeros in each column.

In essence, the transformation takes each input column, transposes and stretches, by adding two 0 value in each column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
