The colors present are blue (1), red (2), and azure (8).\n*   **Output Grid:** A 6x3 grid, also of single-digit integers. The colors are the same as the input, with white(0) added.\n*  The layout appears significant. There's a clear vertical structure, and columns seem important.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
