Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x2 grid. The grid contains two colors: white (0) and azure (8). There are two azure pixels, one in the top right corner and one in the bottom right corner.
*   **Output:** A 9x4 grid. It appears the original input grid has been expanded. The azure pixels from the input now form the four corners of the output grid. The azure pixels are at the edges, separated by two white pixels. The output grid is composed of white(0) and azure(8) pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x2
    colors: [0, 8]
    pattern: two azure pixels on the right edge
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x4
    colors: [0, 8]
    pattern: four azure pixels forming corners, separated by two white pixels, azure at the extremes.
  - relation: output_grid_derived_from: input_grid
    transformation: expansion
    rule: "corners of output are azure pixels from the right of input, expanded with padding of white"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Note their positions, in this case the right side.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output is three times of the input grid in height and double of the input on width.
3. **Create expanded grid**: create an empty (all white) grid of the dimensions (input height \* 3) x (input width \* 2)
4.  **Place Key Pixels:** Place azure (8) pixels in the four corners of the output grid. The azure corners are at the edges with 2 white pixels separation.
5. **Fill**: the rest of the grid remains white.

Essentially, the transformation involves creating a larger grid, placing azure corner pixels and making sure these pixels are positioned at the extremities, with a two-pixel wide separation along rows and 2 rows and 6 rows for the top and bottom azure colored cells. The core concept is expanding the input and repositioning specific colored pixels within a new, larger framework.
