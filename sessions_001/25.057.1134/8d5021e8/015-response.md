Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved expanding gray pixels into 2x2 blocks and filling the remaining space with white. However, subsequent examples reveal nuances: adjacent gray pixels reduce the size of blocks to avoid overlap, and white is used as filler. My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of each training pair. I'll use `code_execution` to compute differences and identify specific error locations.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent rules governing how gray blocks interact when they are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the error analysis and pattern identification, adjust the natural language description to incorporate the observed rules precisely.
4.  **Focus on Adjacency**: Prior observations suggest a simple adjacency but that
    was incomplete. Now it appears we should be checking corners and sides
    separately.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I'll use a structured approach to analyze each example. The key metrics I'll track are:

*   **Correct Pixels:** The number of pixels in the actual output that match the expected output.
*   **Incorrect Pixels:** The number of pixels in the actual output that differ from the expected output.
*   **Error Locations:** Specific (row, column) coordinates where errors occur.
*   **Error Types:** Characterize errors, e.g., "gray block too large," "missing gray pixel," "incorrect fill color."

Here's a breakdown of each example, and I will include code to get information:

```python
import numpy as np
def calculate_accuracy(expected, actual):
    correct = np.sum(expected == actual)
    incorrect = expected.size - correct
    return correct, incorrect

def find_errors(expected, actual):
    return np.where(expected != actual)

def print_grid_around(grid, row, col, size=1):
    """Prints a subgrid centered around (row, col)"""
    start_row = max(0, row - size)
    end_row = min(grid.shape[0], row + size + 1)
    start_col = max(0, col - size)
    end_col = min(grid.shape[1], col + size + 1)

    for r in range(start_row, end_row):
        for c in range(start_col, end_col):
            print(grid[r,c], end=" ")
        print()
    print("---")

    (
        np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),
        np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),

**YAML Facts**

  - name: gray_pixel
    color: 5
    behavior: expands_conditionally
    constraints:
      - adjacent_gray_reduces_expansion
  - name: white_pixel
    color: 0
    behavior: fills_space

  - condition: gray_pixel_present

  - condition: adjacent_gray_pixels
    action: reduce_expansion_size_to_prevent_overlap

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Grid Expansion:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by a fixed rule related to the input dimensions. The height of output is 3 times of the input except if it is 1, the output will be 4 high. The width is twice of the input, except when the input is 1, it will be four wide.
2.  **Gray Pixel Expansion:** Each gray pixel (value 5) in the input grid attempts to expand into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
3.  **Adjacency Constraint:**
    *   If two gray pixels are adjacent horizontally in the input, their expanded blocks in the output will only be 2 pixels high and 1 pixel wide each, effectively sharing a column to avoid overlap.
    *   If two gray pixels are adjacent vertically in the input, their expanded blocks in the output will only be 1 pixel high and 2 pixels wide each, effectively sharing a row to avoid overlap.
    *   If two gray pixels are diagonally adjacent at the *corner*, each expanded block is reduced to 1x1.
    * If two gray pixels are adjecent on a *side* and at a *corner*, the side takes precedence.
4.  **White Pixel Filling:** Any remaining cells in the output grid that are not part of a gray pixel's expanded block are filled with white pixels (value 0).

The first example gave the basic rule, but examples 2-5 showed how to deal with single column and single row source grids.
