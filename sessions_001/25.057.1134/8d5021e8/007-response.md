Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x2 grid containing two colors: red (2) and white (0). The reds form a vertical line on the left, and there's a single white pixel in the top right and another in the bottom right.
*   **Output Grid:** A 9x4 grid. It appears the original input has been somehow expanded or replicated. The output consists primarily of red (2) pixels. White (0) pixels appear in vertical columns, forming two vertical lines on the first and last column of the grid.
* The input pattern is not directly copied, translated or rotated to create the output pattern.
* The output grid is constructed out of combining colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x2
    elements:
      - color: red
        value: 2
        positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0]]
      - color: white
        value: 0
        positions: [[0,1], [2,1]]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x4
    elements:
      - color: red
        value: 2
        positions: 'most positions, except the outlined pattern below'
      - color: white
        value: 0
        positions: [[0,0], [2,0], [3,0], [5,0], [6, 0], [8,0], [0,3], [2,3], [3,3], [5,3], [6, 3], [8,3]]
  - action: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger output grid.
  - relationship:
    description: input pixels influence the colors of the output
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of size 9x4, initially filled entirely with red (value 2).

2.  **White Columns Placement**:
    *   Based on the input image, insert white on the first and last columns of the output grid.

3. **Specific Whites**:
    * For every pixel of the white color, put another pixel of the same color on top and one on the bottom of the output grid.

In summary, the core transformation seems to involve creating a larger grid, replicating an outline defined by the input grid, and selectively adding columns filled by zeros.
