facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x2 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Output grid is 9x4 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Input grid contains only colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - observation: Output grid contains only colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - object: Input_Grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 2
      colors: [0, 5]
  - object: Output_Grid
    type: Grid
    properties:
      rows: 9
      columns: 4
      colors: [0, 5]
  - relationship: Output_Grid is an expansion of Input_Grid.
  - action: Input_Grid elements are replicated in Output_Grid.
  - pattern: Gray (5) pixels in the input grid expand to 2x2 blocks in the output grid, except when adjacent at a corner where they form a shared 2x1 or 1x2 block.
  - pattern:  White (0) pixels expand to fill in empty spaces.
  - geometry: Corner-adjacent gray pixels create a form of overlap or merge in the created blocks, avoiding full 2x2 expansion in the direction of adjacency.
