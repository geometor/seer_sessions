Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation and possibly some color changes, but it's not immediately obvious without further analysis. The overall size and shape of the grid remain constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
  - transformation:
      type: rotation
      details: "90 degrees counter-clockwise"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid.

1.  **Rotate**: rotate the entire input grid by 90 degrees in the counter-clockwise direction
