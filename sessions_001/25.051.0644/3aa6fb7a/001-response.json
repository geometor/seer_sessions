In this case, there are two L-shaped objects.\n\n2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** The azure objects remain unchanged in their positions and shapes in the output grid.\n\n3.  **Introduce Blue Pixels:** For each azure object, identify the cell immediately to the right of the top-most and left-most corner of the \"L\". Change the color of these cells to blue (color 1).\n\n    *   For the top-left L-shape, this cell is (1, 2).\n    *    For the bottom-right L-shape, this is the cell (4,4).\n\n4. Fill with the color white all the cells that are not azure or blue.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n```\ninput:  a grid of pixels with colors from 0 to 9.\noutput: a grid of pixels with colors from 0 to 9.\n\nprogram:\n  for each azure (8) object in input:\n    copy object to the output\n    let P be the top-left corner of the bounding box that contains the object\n    paint in blue the pixel at P.right\n  paint in white all other pixels\n```\n"
