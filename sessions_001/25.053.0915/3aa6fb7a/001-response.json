The dominant colors are white (0) and azure (8). The output grid introduces a blue (1) pixel, which seems to be related to the position of the azure pixels. My initial strategy is to:\n\n1.  Quantify the occurrences of each color in both input and output.\n2.  Analyze the spatial relationship between the azure (8) pixels and the newly introduced blue (1) pixels.\n3.  Formulate a hypothesis about the rule governing the placement of the blue pixel.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\n"
