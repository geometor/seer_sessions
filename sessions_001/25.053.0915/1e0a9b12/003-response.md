Okay, here's a breakdown of the example and my plan to figure out the transformation:

**General Assessment:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored numbers (0-9) into another grid. The dimensions of the grid seem to stay the same (6x6). The most obvious change is the movement of the maroon '9' from the top right to the bottom right, and azure '8' also has moved. Other numbers ('4' yellow, '7' orange, '8' azure) remain in same position. It seems to me like the non-zero numbers along the right and bottom border are all being kept, while the non-zero digits on the interior of the matrix are removed, and the non-zero values on the top and right borders are moved to the bottom.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Data Extraction:** Use Python to load the input and output grids into 2D arrays.
2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Calculate basic metrics:
    *   Dimensions of the grids (should be the same).
    *   Unique colors/numbers present.
    *   Positions of each unique color/number in both input and output.
3.  **Object Identification:**
    *  Consider each contiguous block of the same color as an "object". It is also possible the entire grid is a single object.
4.  **Relationship Analysis:** Analyze how the positions of the non-zero colors change from input to output. Look for patterns like:
    *   Movement (translation, rotation, reflection).
    *   Changes in color/number.
    *   Conditional changes based on position or neighbors.
5.  **Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):** Describe the transformation rule in clear, step-by-step instructions using natural language. Focus on actions performed on objects or the whole grid, and any conditions or logic that dictate the transformation.
6.  **YAML Documentation** Provide a yaml document with the observed facts.

**Code Execution for Metrics:**




*code_execution:*

```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],
    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0],
    [4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0],
    [4, 0, 7, 8, 0, 9]
])

def grid_metrics(grid, name):
    print(f"Metrics for {name}:")
    print(f"  Dimensions: {grid.shape}")
    unique_values = np.unique(grid)
    print(f"  Unique values: {unique_values}")
    for value in unique_values:
        if value != 0:
            positions = np.argwhere(grid == value)
            print(f"  Positions of {value}: {positions.tolist()}")

grid_metrics(input_grid, "Input Grid")
grid_metrics(output_grid, "Output Grid")


```


*code_execution_result:*

outcome: 1

```
Metrics for Input Grid:
  Dimensions: (6, 6)
  Unique values: [0 4 7 8 9]
  Positions of 4: [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]]
  Positions of 7: [[4, 2], [5, 2]]
  Positions of 8: [[1, 3], [4, 3]]
  Positions of 9: [[0, 5]]
Metrics for Output Grid:
  Dimensions: (6, 6)
  Unique values: [0 4 7 8 9]
  Positions of 4: [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]]
  Positions of 7: [[4, 2], [5, 2]]
  Positions of 8: [[4, 3], [5, 3]]
  Positions of 9: [[5, 5]]

```

**YAML Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: (6, 6)
    unique_colors: [0, 4, 7, 8, 9]
    color_positions:
      4: [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]]
      7: [[4, 2], [5, 2]]
      8: [[1, 3], [4, 3]]
      9: [[0, 5]]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: (6, 6)
    unique_colors: [0, 4, 7, 8, 9]
    color_positions:
      4: [[3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0]]
      7: [[4, 2], [5, 2]]
      8: [[4, 3], [5, 3]]
      9: [[5, 5]]
  - transformation:
      description: "Move border digits to bottom border"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Border Values:** Locate all non-zero values (colors other than white) on the top and right borders of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve and Translate:**
    *   All non-zero pixels on the left and bottom borders stay.
    *   All non-zero pixels that were originally on the top border are placed on the bottom border, maintaining their original column.
    *   All non-zero pixels that were originally on the right border are placed on the bottom border after the original bottom border elements and the moved top border elements. The relative order of the original right border elements is maintained.
3.   **Clear Interior:** All non-zero digits not on the left or bottom border of the original image, are changed to zero.
