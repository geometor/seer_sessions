            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the example and my plan to figure out the transformation:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of colored numbers (0-9) into another grid. The dimensions of the grid seem to stay the same (6x6). The most obvious change is the movement of the maroon '9' from the top right to the bottom right, and azure '8' also has moved. Other numbers ('4' yellow, '7' orange, '8' azure) remain in same position. It seems to me like the non-zero numbers along the right and bottom border are all being kept, while the non-zero digits on the interior of the matrix are removed, and the non-zero values on the top and right borders are moved to the bottom.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Data Extraction:** Use Python to load the input and output grids into 2D arrays.\n2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Calculate basic metrics:\n    *   Dimensions of the grids (should be the same).\n    *   Unique colors/numbers present.\n    *   Positions of each unique color/number in both input and output.\n3.  **Object Identification:**\n    *  Consider each contiguous block of the same color as an \"object\". It is also possible the entire grid is a single object.\n4.  **Relationship Analysis:** Analyze how the positions of the non-zero colors change from input to output. Look for patterns like:\n    *   Movement (translation, rotation, reflection).\n    *   Changes in color/number.\n    *   Conditional changes based on position or neighbors.\n5.  **Transformation Rule (Natural Language Program):** Describe the transformation rule in clear, step-by-step instructions using natural language. Focus on actions performed on objects or the whole grid, and any conditions or logic that dictate the transformation.\n6.  **YAML Documentation** Provide a yaml document with the observed facts.\n\n**Code Execution for Metrics:**\n\n"
