The transformation appears to rearrange the grid elements without changing the set of unique digits present. The overall structure (3x3 grid) is preserved. The central element (7, orange) remains in the center. The other numbers seem to have been mirrored, across both vertical and horizontal axes.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Specifically, an element at position (row, col) will move to position (2-row, 2-col). This can also be looked upon as rotation of the matrix by 180 degrees.\n\n"
