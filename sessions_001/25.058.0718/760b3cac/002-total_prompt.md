## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x75AD93DE8AD0>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 8 0 8 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0

0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids (input and output) of the same dimensions (6x9).  The grids contain single-digit integers (0, 4, and 8) representing different colors (white, yellow, and azure, respectively).  The non-zero digits appear to form distinct objects. The transformation seems to affect only the azure (8) objects, while the yellow (4) object remains unchanged. The azure objects in the top rows are modified.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_types:
      - color: 8  # Azure
        shape: irregular
        initial_state: dispersed
        final_state: left-aligned, vertically-extended
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        shape: irregular
        initial_state: compact
        final_state: unchanged
      - color: 0 #white/background
        shape: fills remaining cells
        initial_state: background
        final_state: background
  - actions:
    - type: move
      targets: object with color 8
      description: move parts from one area to another
      rules: the object is left-aligned and vertically extends to occupy the first 3 rows of the grid
  - relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description:  Yellow (4) object remains static; Azure(8) objects are dynamic.
    - type: unchanged
      description: objects of 4 are invariant during transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the value '8' (azure) and '4' (yellow), and '0' (white). Consider each block a separate object.
2.  **Preserve Yellow:** The yellow (4) object, and the white (0) background are invariant. Do not modify its position or shape.
3. **Transform Azure:** Modify the azure (8) object.
4. **Left align and extend.** Move all azure pixels to the left, occupying column one if available.
5. **Fill three rows** If necessary continue adding the azure (8) pixels in columns to the right. Extend/Fill the first three rows of the grid completely.

In essence, the transformation rule can be summarized as: "Preserve the yellow object, move all azure pixels to the left, and fill the first three rows."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
