The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all azure (color 8) objects in the input grid. There are two distinct shapes formed by azure colored cells: two cells forming a vertical line, and two cells forming a horizontal line.

2.  **Preserve Azure Objects:** Copy all azure colored areas to the output grid, in their respective locations.

3.  **Introduce Blue Pixel, Top:** Identify the azure object with the upper-leftmost coordinate. Add a blue (color 1) pixel to the right of its upper-rightmost coordinate.

4.  **Introduce Blue Pixel, Bottom:** Identify the azure object with the bottom-leftmost coordinate. Add a blue pixel (color 1) to the left of its bottom-leftmost coordinate.

In summary, the transformation preserves the azure objects and introduces two blue pixels that are placed according to the described rules.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
