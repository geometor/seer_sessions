Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains three distinct colors: white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The output grid contains only red (2) and white (0). The azure (8) regions in the input seem to disappear entirely, effectively cropping the input grid to the bounding box defined by the red pixels. The output grid appears to be a cropped version of the red (2) region from the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - subject: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, azure, red]
      dimensions: [21, 21]
  - subject: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, red]
      dimensions: [10, 10]
  - subject: transformation
    type: operation
    description: cropping
    details:
      - input grid is cropped to the bounding box of red pixels
      - azure pixels are removed
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** Find the bounding box within the input grid that encompasses all red (2) pixels. This means finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices where red pixels are present.

2.  **Crop the Input:** Extract the section of the input grid defined by the bounding box found in step 1. This sub-grid will contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid will have rows and columns equal to the height and width of the bounding box.

3. **Return Cropped Grid:** Return the cropped sub-grid as result.
