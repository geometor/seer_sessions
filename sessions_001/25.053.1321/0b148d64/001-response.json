The input grid contains three distinct colors: white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The output grid contains only red (2) and white (0). The azure (8) regions in the input seem to disappear entirely, effectively cropping the input grid to the bounding box defined by the red pixels. The output grid appears to be a cropped version of the red (2) region from the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This means finding the minimum and maximum row and column indices where red pixels are present.\n\n2.  **Crop the Input:** Extract the section of the input grid defined by the bounding box found in step 1. This sub-grid will contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid will have rows and columns equal to the height and width of the bounding box.\n\n3. **Return Cropped Grid:** Return the cropped sub-grid as result.\n"
