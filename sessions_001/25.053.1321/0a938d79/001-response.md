Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a few isolated pixels of color 'red' (2) and 'azure' (8) on a background of 'white' (0). The output grid seems to extend the pattern of the input 'red' and 'azure' pixels across the entire grid, maintaining their relative positions. The output is a checkerboard, and all rows are the same.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Initial state of the grid with single colored pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red, azure]
      - dimensions: [10, 25] # Height, Width

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Transformed state of the grid with repeating colored pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red, azure]
      - dimensions: [10, 25]

  - action: pattern_extension
    description: The isolated colored pixels in the input are extended into columns.
    details: >
      The positions of non-white pixels in the input define columns.
      The column repeats every other pixel.
      The column of a color continues through the rest of the row.

  - relation: input_output_correspondence
    description: Each non-white pixel in the input corresponds to a alternating column of the same color in the output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all non-white pixels within the input grid. Record their color and column index.

2.  **Column Generation**: Iterate through the input columns
    For the key pixels identified, find the column number of the color.
    Generate a full-height column with this value.

3.  **Construct the Output Grid**: Assemble the output grid where each column corresponds to the generated color column, creating an alternating pattern.
    Replicate that to all rows.
