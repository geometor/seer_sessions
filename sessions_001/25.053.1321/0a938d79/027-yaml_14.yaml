observations:
  - task: 026
  - example_set: training
  - general_rule: |
      The output grid replicates a pattern constructed from rows with a single,
      non-zero color expanded to fill the entire row. The input grid is
      analyzed to identify any rows where all the values are zero except for
      a single, non-zero value. The identified rows are duplicated and
      interleaved with a row of all zeroes to build the output grid.
  - objects:
      - type: row
        property: significant
        description: Contains only one non-zero color.
        actions:
          - expand: Fill the entire row with the single color.
          - duplicate: Create a copy of the row.
          - interleave: place the expanded significant rows in alternating
            order in the output, and interleave single rows of all zeros
            between them.
  - pattern:
      - type: alternating_rows
        description: The output grid is constructed by repeating the pattern from top
          to bottom.
  - dimensions:
      - input_height: Varies per example
        input_width: Varies per example
        output_height: Same as input height.
        output_width: Same as input width.
