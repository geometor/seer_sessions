"""
1.  **Identify Seed Rows:** Find all rows in the input grid that contain at least one non-white pixel. These are the "seed rows."

2.  **Iterate Through Seed Rows (Top to Bottom):**
    * Record the row index of the seed row.

3.  **Process Each Seed Pixel:** For each seed row, iterate through each non-white pixel in the row from left to right:
    *   Record the color and column index of the seed pixel.
    *   Fill the cell at the current row and column with the seed pixel's color.
    *   The colors of each of the seed pixels in the seed rows will fill every
        row of the grid, alternating between each of the colors in order.

4. **Combine Colors**: The output grid will consist of the combined color
   patterns, stacked.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of identifying "seed rows" and propagating their non-white pixel colors downwards is partially correct. However, the current implementation has several flaws:

1.  **Incorrect Horizontal Placement:** The code attempts to maintain the original column position of the seed pixel but then overwrites it. It should use a method that replicates an entire row. The seed row establishes the color palette for subsequent rows.
2.  **Incorrect Alternation:** The code alternates colors based on the row index modulo the *total* number of seed pixels across all seed rows. Instead, it should create a sequence of colors across each seed row, and then apply that full sequence, repeatedly, to the following rows, modulo the length of the color sequence.
3.  **Incorrect Stacking, Repetition and Ordering**: In example 3, two seed rows appear, and example 4 has two seed rows and the output grid is a stack of the seed rows repeated until the input grid height is matched.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Horizontal Filling:** Instead of setting individual pixels based on column index, the code should fill the entire row with the chosen color from the sequence.
2.  **Correct Alternation:** The code should determine the color sequence from the *seed row*, and then step through this sequence using the output row index modulo the length of the *sequence* (not the total number of seed pixels).
3.  **Stacking and Repetition**: the number of times to repeat the stack of seed rows is a simple calculation - determine how many times the seed rows stack into the height of the output grid.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on relevant metrics:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 10x25
    *   Output Size: 10x25
    *   Seed Rows: 2 (row indices 0, 9)
    *   Seed Pixels Row 0: `[(5, 2)]`
    *   Seed Pixels Row 9: `[(7, 8)]`
    *   Color Sequence: `[2, 8]`
    *   Output Pattern: All rows are filled with an alternating sequence of `[2, 8, 2, 8, ...]`.
    * **Error**: Only two colors filled alternating by row, not a repeating sequence horizontally.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 7x23
    *   Output Size: 7x23
    *   Seed Rows: 2
    *   Seed Pixels row 0: `[(5, 1)]`
    *   Seed Pixels row 6: `[(8, 3)]`
    *   Color Sequence: `[1, 3]`
    *   Output Pattern: All rows are filled with an alternating sequence of `[1, 3, 1, 3, ...]`.
    * **Error**: Only two colors filled alternating by row, not a repeating sequence horizontally.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 22x9
    *   Output Size: 22x9
    *   Seed Rows: 3 (rows 5,7)
    *   Seed Pixels row 5: `[(0, 2)]`
    *   Seed Pixels row 7: `[(8, 3)]`
    *   Color Sequence: `[2, 3]` and the seed rows stack repeatedly, repeating the colors in order.
    *   Output Pattern: The output is a repeating stack of the seed rows.
    * **Error**: Colors not properly placed, incorrect order and incorrect repetition.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Size: 24x8
    *   Output Size: 24x8
    *   Seed Rows: 2 (rows 7, 11)
    *   Seed Pixels row 7: `[(0, 4)]`
    * Seed Pixels row 11: `[(0,1)]`
    *   Color Sequence: `[4, 1]` The output consists of stacked copies of the seed rows.
    *   Output Pattern: Stacking with the correct colors.
    *   **Error**: The fill is vertical instead of horizontal.

  - name: extract_color_sequence
    input: seed_rows
    output: color_sequence
    description: Create an ordered list of colors from the non-white pixels in the seed_row, preserving their left-to-right order.

  - name: construct output
    input: input grid, color sequence
    output: output grid
    description: Build output by stacking copies of the color sequence seed
      rows until the input grid height is matched.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Rows:** Examine the input grid and identify "seed rows," which are rows containing at least one non-white pixel.
2.  **Create Color Sequence For Each Seed Row**: Scan each seed row from left to right. For each non-white pixel encountered, record its color. The ordered sequence of colors becomes the color sequence for that seed row.
3.  **Stack Seed Rows**: Repeat the stack of seed rows until the height of the stack equals the height of the input grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
