1.  **Identify Significant Rows:** Scan the input grid to find rows that contain exactly one non-zero (non-white) color value, and the rest are zeros.
2.  **Expand Rows:** For each significant row found, expand the single non-zero color to fill the entire row.
3. **Create Pattern**: Copy rows from top to bottom, replicating the row below the single color row twice, and repeating the pattern to the bottom of the grid.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of identifying "significant rows" (rows with a single non-zero color) and expanding them was a good starting point. However, the pattern creation and replication logic is flawed and doesn't accurately capture the interleaving/alternating pattern observed in the correct outputs. The code also has issues with indexing. The core problem is that the code is trying to apply complex index manipulation, when the actual transformation seems to be based on a much simpler concept of creating an alternating sequence of the "significant" rows.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Simplify Pattern Logic:** Instead of complex indexing to create copies, focus on building a simple alternating sequence from the "significant rows".
2.  **Correct Row Expansion:** Ensure that the initial identification and expansion of significant rows are correct.
3.  **Iterative Pattern Application:** Apply the alternating pattern across the entire output grid.

**Gather Metrics and Result Analysis (via Code Execution):**

I don't have the ability to directly execute code within this response. However, I can describe the analysis that *would* be performed if I could, and summarize what it would reveal based on the provided image outputs and pixel differences.

If I had code execution, I would do the following:

1.  **Pixel Count Analysis:** For each example (both input and expected output), calculate the count of each color. This will help in understanding if the transformation is simply rearranging pixels or introducing/removing them. The provided results show "correct_pixel_counts: False" for all, but it's still good to verify.
2.  **Object Identification:** Identify contiguous blocks of the same color in both input and output as "objects." Count the objects and their sizes.
3.  **Positional Analysis:** For each object, track its top-left and bottom-right coordinates. This helps in understanding the movement/transformation of objects.

Based on the provided data, the code execution results would largely confirm these observations:

*   The number of output rows is the same as input rows.
*   The output is some combination of the identified "significant" rows.
*  The existing code does not replicate the rows according to the examples.
*  The examples have a pattern of single colored, expanded rows, with a
    secondary row inserted between them.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: 026
  - example_set: training
  - general_rule: |
      The output grid replicates a pattern constructed from rows with a single,
      non-zero color expanded to fill the entire row. The input grid is
      analyzed to identify any rows where all the values are zero except for
      a single, non-zero value. The identified rows are duplicated and
      interleaved with a row of all zeroes to build the output grid.
  - objects:
      - type: row
        property: significant
        description: Contains only one non-zero color.
        actions:
          - expand: Fill the entire row with the single color.
          - duplicate: Create a copy of the row.
          - interleave: place the expanded significant rows in alternating
            order in the output, and interleave single rows of all zeros
            between them.
  - pattern:
      - type: alternating_rows
        description: The output grid is constructed by repeating the pattern from top
          to bottom.
  - dimensions:
      - input_height: Varies per example
        input_width: Varies per example
        output_height: Same as input height.
        output_width: Same as input width.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Significant Rows:** Scan the input grid to find rows that contain exactly one non-zero (non-white) color value, with all other values in that row being zero (white).
2.  **Expand Significant Rows:** For each "significant row" found, expand the single non-zero color to fill the entire row.
3.  **Build the output:**
   - determine order of the identified colors from significant rows, from
     top to bottom
    - create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input
    - interleave the identified rows in the original order with rows of all
      zeros, repeating this to the bottom of the grid

This revised natural language program is significantly simpler and more accurately reflects the core transformation logic. It focuses on the key idea of identifying and expanding "significant" rows and interleaving with zero rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
