  - objects:
      - description: Non-white pixels in the input grid.
        properties:
          - color: Varies (red, azure, blue, green, yellow).
          - position: (row, column) coordinate within the grid.
        actions:
          - extend_downward: The color of the pixel is extended downwards, filling the column below it.
          - wrap_rows: extension fills all rows below, then wraps back to row 0 and continues until the input row is reached
  - general_rule: |
      The output grid is created by identifying each non-white pixel in the input grid. 
      For each non-white pixel, its color is extended downwards, filling the rest of its column. 
      The rows below are filled, then, it continues extending by wrapping around to the top of the grid (row 0) and filling down. This continues until the original row of the pixel is reached.
