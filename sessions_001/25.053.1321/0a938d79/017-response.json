The input contains two distinct colored pixels: red (2) and green (3). The output shows that the rows containing the red and green pixels, as well as every other row below them, are filled with the color of the initial pixel in that row. The pattern of filled rows alternates, repeating until the bottom of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
