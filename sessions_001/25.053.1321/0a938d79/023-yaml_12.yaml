objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: same as input_grid
      - width: same as input_grid
      - cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: seed_row
    type: row within input_grid
    properties:
      - row_index: integer
      - seed_pixels: list of non-white pixels
        - column_index: integer
        - color: integer (1-9)

  - name: color_sequence
    type: ordered list of colors
    properties:
    - colors are from non-white seed row pixels, maintaining original order

actions:
  - name: identify_seed_rows
    input: input_grid
    output: list of seed_row objects
    description: Find rows with at least one non-white pixel.

  - name: extract_color_sequence
    input: seed_rows
    output: color_sequence
    description: Create an ordered list of colors from the non-white pixels in the seed_row, preserving their left-to-right order.

  - name: construct output
    input: input grid, color sequence
    output: output grid
    description: Build output by stacking copies of the color sequence seed
      rows until the input grid height is matched.
