The input grid contains a few isolated pixels of color 'red' (2) and 'azure' (8) on a background of 'white' (0). The output grid seems to extend the pattern of the input 'red' and 'azure' pixels across the entire grid, maintaining their relative positions. The output is a checkerboard, and all rows are the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
