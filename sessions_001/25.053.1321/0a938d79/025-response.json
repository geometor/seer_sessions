The primary elements are:\n\n*   **Single-color rows:** Rows containing only one color (besides white/0).\n*   **Color Propagation:**  The non-white color in a single-color row appears to be replicated.\n*   **Pattern Repetition:** The replicated color forms a repeated pattern of rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
