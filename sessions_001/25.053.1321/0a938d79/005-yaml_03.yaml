observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      cells: pixels with color values 0-9
    actions:
      - fill_columns:
          trigger: presence of non-white pixels
          mechanism: >
            For each column, if there are any colored pixels, fill downwards 
            from the top row using the color of the colored pixel in that
            column with the smallest row index. If multiple, use the one
            from the highest row, wrapping around to the top if needed.
          interaction: columns are filled independently, taking the color of the
            'highest' non-white pixel if any are in the column.
