            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code are based on a \"column-wise top-most non-white pixel dominance\" rule.  While this captures some aspect of the transformation, it's clearly insufficient.  The expected outputs show a more complex pattern where the colors in a column *repeat* based on all non-white colors in the input, and the order of the non-white colors matters. The provided code only uses the top-most. The strategy will involve changing the existing program significantly to reflect the repeating column pattern seen in the expected outputs.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Results:**\n\nHere's a summary of the metrics for each example, focusing on elements not yet described in the previous prompt:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has non-white pixels in columns 5 (red) and 7 (azure).\n    *   Expected output alternates red and azure in *every* column that contains non-white pixel, the output fills the whole column and repeats red, azure, red, azure ...\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has non-white pixels in columns 5 (blue) and 8 (green).\n    *   Expected output alternates blue and green in those columns that have non-white pixels, repeating from top to bottom of the output grid: blue, green, blue, green.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input contains red in the first column and green in the last.\n    *   Expected output is more complex and appears to be a repeating sequence\n    *    The sequence of red, then white, then green occurs down the length of *all* of the columns.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Input contains yellow in the first column, and blue in the first column\n        as well.\n    *    Expected Output has columns alternating between yellow and blue with\n         white stripes, filling columns where the colors exist in the input.\n         yellow, blue, yellow, blue\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: red\n        column: 5\n      - color: azure\n        column: 7\n    output_pattern: |\n      Columns with non-white input pixels repeat the sequence of those colors\n      down the entire column. Columns without non-white input pixels are all white.\n\n  - example: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - color: blue\n        column: 5\n      - color: green\n        column: 8\n    output_pattern: |\n      Columns with non-white input pixels repeat the sequence of those colors\n      down the entire column. Columns without non-white input pixels are all white.\n\n  - example: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - color: red\n        column: 0\n      - color: green\n        column: 8\n    output_pattern: |\n        all columns become a repeating sequence of all non-white colors, top to bottom.\n\n  - example: 4\n    input_objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          column: 0\n        - color: blue\n          column: 0\n\n    output_pattern: |\n       all columns become a repeating sequence of all non-white colors, top to bottom.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Non-White Colors:** Examine the entire input grid and create an ordered list of all unique non-white colors present, maintaining their original order of appearance from top to bottom, left to right.\n2.  **Process Each Column** Iterate through each column of the *output* grid.\n3.  **Fill Columns with color sequence**. Fill each cell down the column with the ordered color sequence, repeat until the end of the column\n    .\n\nThis revised natural language program addresses the repeating pattern and column-wise application, deviating significantly from the initial \"top-most\" logic.\n"
