Train Set Results:

## Example 1:**

Input:
```
None
```
Expected Output:
```
None
```
match: None
pixels_off: None
size_correct: None
color_palette_correct: None
correct_pixel_counts: None
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, incorporating the results of the code execution on the training examples.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (from the first example) was that green pixels surrounded by two or more other green pixels diagonally are changed to yellow. The code execution reveals that this rule is not entirely accurate and needs refinement. The provided code execution results include a comparison between the `expected_output` and a `transformed_output` which seem to come from a png file. I don't have enough context to understand how the .png are produced, so my analysis will focus on the `input_grid` and `expected_output`, and the provided analysis performed by `analyze_green_pixels`.

The provided `analyze_green_pixels` analysis function is useful, and I will reuse it in my analysis, but I need more data. I will run this function using my predicted output (once I have it) instead of using `transformed_output`, in order to verify the function's usefulness.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** I will re-examine *all* provided training examples, focusing on the relationship between the input and expected output grids. The .png comparison is not useful without context.
2.  **Develop Improved Metrics:** I will compute confusion matrices for each example to better understand the pixel transformations. I will extend the current metrics with other relevant data, such as properties of connected components.
3.  **Refine Hypothesis and Natural Language Program:** Based on the re-examination and new metrics, I will develop a more accurate and comprehensive natural language program.
4.  **Iterate:** This process may need to be repeated as I gather more information and test the updated hypotheses.

**Metrics and Code Execution:**
I can't directly execute shell commands, but will use the provided `analyze_green_pixels`. The first step is to load the data.

                neighbors.append(grid[row+i, col+j])

**Natural Language Program:**

Based on the analysis, all green pixels are changing to yellow in all training examples. Also, all green pixels in all training examples have at least one neighbor that is not black.

1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value 3 (green).
2.  **Change to Yellow:** Change the value of all identified green pixels to 4 (yellow).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
