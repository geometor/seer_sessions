Okay, let's analyze the results of the tests and refine the natural language program and overall strategy.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of finding *all* green (3) pixels and changing them to yellow (4). However, the test results clearly show this isn't the complete rule.  The expected outputs demonstrate that only *some* green pixels within a contiguous green object are changed to yellow, and this change seems related to the shape and connectivity of the green object.  The current `find_object` function correctly identifies contiguous regions, but the transformation logic is too simplistic. It changes *all* green pixels in an object, while it should only change a subset based on a more complex criteria. It also does not accurately find only a single object.

My strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze the failures**: Examine the `pixels_off` in each example and the transformed images to understand where the logic is incorrect. I will focus on the spatial relationships between green and yellow pixels in the expected output.
2.  **Refine object properties**: I need to characterize the green objects more comprehensively. This includes not only their coordinates but also features like their bounding box, perimeter, and internal structure.
3. **Revisit the color change**: The condition to change color should not be simply, change all, but depend on position within a larger shape.
4. **Iterate and Develop**: start with adding observations to YAML.

**Metrics and Observations (using assumed code execution results from above):**

I'll summarize the provided test results, including the pixel differences:

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | `pixels_off` | Notes                                                                                               |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | (6, 6)      | (6, 6)       | 3            | Only one '3' changed to '4'; others stay '3'. It appears connected '3's are not an object.       |
| 2       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | 2            | Again, only some '3's change. There seems to be no change when object is only in 1 dimension        |
| 3       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | 10           | Many mismatches. It appears '3's that make up a 2x2 shape become 4                                    |
| 4       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | 31           | A large, complex green object.  The interior '3's seem more likely to change.                       |
| 5       | (20, 20)    | (20, 20)     | 32           | Very large and complex. Interior green surrounded by green, is becoming yellow.                       |

**YAML Block (Observations):**

          shape: interior, complex
    transformation: "interior green pixels that have four neighbors of the
                      same color are changed to yellow"

  - example: 5
    input_objects:
      - color: 3
        shape: complex
        contiguous: true,
        notes: Very large and complex objects
    output_objects:
      - color: 3
        shape: complex, edges
      - color: 4
        shape: complex, interior
    transformation: "interior green pixels of larger objects are changed to yellow"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Consider pixels connected if they share an edge (4-connectivity).
2.  **Object Classification**:
    *   **Isolated Pixels**: If a green pixel has no green neighbors, it *may* change to yellow.
    *   **Lines**: Green pixels forming a 1-dimensional line (only two neighbors, except ends which have 1) remain green.
    *  **2x2 Blocks**: If green pixels exist in connected 2x2 blocks, they all change color to 4.
    *  **Complex Interior**: Within a larger contiguous green object, change a green pixel to yellow (4) if it is completely surrounded by other green pixels (4-connectivity).
3.  **Output:** Create the output grid by applying these transformation rules to the identified objects.

This refined program incorporates the observation that only *some* green pixels change, and that the change depends on the local neighborhood of each pixel.  It differentiates between isolated pixels, lines, and the interior of larger objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
