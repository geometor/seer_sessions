The primary colors observed are white (0) and green (3). There's a transformation where some green (3) pixels in the input become yellow (4) in the output. The transformation seems to be localized and specific to certain green pixels. It does not appear to follow simple global operations like color replacement or rotations.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Change these interior pixels to yellow (4).\n4.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the modified pixels.\n\nIn summary. The program identifies contiguous green area.
