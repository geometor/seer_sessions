facts:
  - task: "Change green pixels to yellow within a green object."
  - objects:
      - color: 3  # Green
        type: "contiguous shape"
        properties:
          - "can vary in size and shape"
          - "pixels within the shape can change color"
  - actions:
      - find: "contiguous shapes of color 3"
      - transform:
          color_change:
            from: 3  # Green
            to: 4  # Yellow
          conditions:
            - "Applies to multiple pixels within the green shape"
            - "Exact positions change are relative to the overall shape and inner adjacencies"
  - constraints:
    - "Only pixels within the identified green object are affected."
    - "Pixels outside the object remain unchanged."
