  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
  - id: green_regions
    type: list
    description: List of contiguous regions of green pixels. Each region is a list of (row, col) coordinates.
  - id: inner_region
    type: list
    description: Subset of green_region, representing pixels to be changed to yellow.

actions:
  - name: find_contiguous_regions
    input: grid, color
    output: green_regions
    description: Identifies all contiguous regions of the specified color.
  - name: determine_inner_region
    input: grid, green_region
    output: inner_region
    description: Determines which pixels within a green region are considered "inner" and should be transformed. The current implementation is flawed.
  - name: transform_color
    input: grid, inner_region, old_color, new_color
    output: modified_grid
    description: Changes the color of pixels in the inner_region from old_color to new_color.
