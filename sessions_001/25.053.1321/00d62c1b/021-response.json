            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the code's performance, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code have a fundamental flaw in how they define the \"inner region.\" The current approach uses a flood fill from *outside* the grid to determine what's *not* filled, which is then intersected with the original green region. However, this approach incorrectly identifies the \"inner region.\" It's essentially finding *all* pixels of the green object, not just the interior pixels. The examples clearly show that only green pixels *surrounded by other green pixels* should be transformed to yellow. The flood fill logic needs to identify interior green cells within a green object.\n\nThe core strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Correctly Identify Interior Pixels:** Instead of relying solely on an external flood fill, we must identify green pixels that are completely surrounded by other green pixels (up, down, left, and right).\n\n2.  **Refine Flood Fill Use:** While flood-fill *can* still be helpful for finding contiguous green regions, it should not be used as the primary mechanism for defining \"inner-ness\". The concept of \"inner\" green pixels should be based on direct adjacency to other green pixels, not on external flood fill.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of the metrics, combining the provided information with additional observations:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Color Palette Correct | Correct Pixel Counts | Notes                                                                                                                 |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :---- | :--------- | :----------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (6, 6)      | (6, 6)       | False | 8          | True         | True                  | False                 | The \"inner region\" is incorrectly identified as the entire green area.                                                |\n| 2       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | False | 16         | True         | True                  | False                 | Same issue as Example 1. The flood fill is capturing all green areas, not truly the inner ones.                     |\n| 3       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | False | 31         | True         | True                  | False                 | Highlights the problem with larger, more complex shapes. The error increases significantly.                        |\n| 4       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | False | 35         | True         | True                  | False                 | Shows the issue with connected shapes and irregular boundaries.                                                  |\n| 5       | (20, 20)    | (20, 20)     | False | 98         | True         | True                  | False                 | Largest example, demonstrates that the current approach fails to handle even moderately complex arrangements.       |\n\n**YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: green_region\n    type: contiguous_region\n    color: green\n    properties:\n      - surrounded:  # Indicates whether a green pixel is surrounded by other green pixels\n          type: boolean\n          value: varies  # True for inner pixels, False for edge pixels\n\n  - name: background\n    type: area\n    color: varies # Usually black (0)\n\nactions:\n  - name: transform_color\n    input: green_region\n    properties:\n        - surrounded: True  # Only apply transformation to surrounded green pixels\n    output_color: yellow\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of green (color value 3) pixels in the input grid.  A contiguous region is a group of pixels of the same color that are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).\n\n2.  **Identify Inner Green Pixels:** Within each green region, identify \"inner\" green pixels. A green pixel is considered \"inner\" if and only if it is directly adjacent (above, below, left, and right) to *four* other green pixels.\n\n3.  **Transform Inner Pixels:** Change the color of all identified \"inner\" green pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).\n\n4. **Output:** The output is the input grid modified with \"inner\" green cells changed to yellow.\n"
