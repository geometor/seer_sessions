The input grid appears to contain a shape formed by the digit '3' (green) on a background of '0' (white). The output grid is almost identical to the input, except for a single '3' being changed to a '4' (yellow). This suggests a highly localized, possibly rule-based or coordinate-based, modification. The core operation seems to be identifying a specific '3' and changing its value.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Based purely on this *single example*, it seems like the 4 is one up from bottom of the object and centered, but with a single point it is difficult to determine what feature marks it as a coordinate.\n3. **Perform the change:** Change the value of the located '3' pixel to '4' (yellow).\n4.  **Preserve the Rest:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\nIt should be noted, with a single example it is very difficult to pinpoint how the changed pixel is selected. More examples will make it easier to determine the rule.\n"
