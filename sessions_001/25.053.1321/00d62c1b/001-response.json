The input grid contains pixels of color 'white' (0) and 'green' (3). The output grid is identical to the input grid except for some green pixels that become 'yellow'(4). The change appears to affect only some green pixels. Examining the locations, It appears that the yellow pixels are always adjacent to two green pixels, on opposing sides.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
