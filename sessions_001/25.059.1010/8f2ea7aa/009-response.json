The primary color involved is orange (7), with the background being white (0). The transformation seems to involve some form of mirroring or reflection of the orange objects, both horizontally and vertically, and perhaps diagonally. The shape formed by the orange pixels is altered significantly.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Place the orange pixels into locations on the grid based on mirroring these coordinates.\n\n3.  **Combine:** Mirror all orange pixels again but on the diagonal that runs from the top right to bottom left, and also on the diagonal axis that runs from the top left to the bottom right. Place the orange pixels into locations on the grid based on mirroring these coordinates.\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid consists of mirrored pixels.\n\nIn simpler terms, the orange shape in the input is mirrored or reflected both vertically, horizontally, and diagonally to generate the output.\n"
