Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on identifying a magenta shape, expanding it, and creating a mirrored copy. While this worked for the first training example, it fails to accurately capture the transformations in the other examples. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of the mirroring and expansion process. The code expands each pixel individually, instead of considering shape properties. It also mirrors the original form across it's own center, instead of across grid lines or other reference points.

Here's the strategy to address the errors:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the positioning, size, and orientation of the magenta shapes.
2.  **Identify Transformation Rules:** Determine the precise rules governing the placement of new shapes.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the description to reflect the specific transformation rules observed, with considerations for cases beyond single, connected shape.
4.   use code execution to establish properties and verify assumptions.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To provide accurate metrics and reports, I'll use the `code_execution` tool.
I want to determine if it is the correct approach of expanding and mirroring.

```python
def describe_grid(grid):
    """Provides a simple description of a grid."""
    shape = grid.shape
    unique_values = np.unique(grid)
    return f"Shape: {shape}, Unique values: {unique_values}"

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """Compares two grids and reports differences."""
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Grids have different shapes."
    diff = grid1 != grid2
    diff_coords = np.where(diff)
    diff_values_grid1 = grid1[diff_coords]
    diff_values_grid2 = grid2[diff_coords]

    num_diffs = len(diff_coords[0])
    return f"Number of different pixels: {num_diffs}, Grid1 values: {diff_values_grid1}, Grid2 values: {diff_values_grid2}"

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
