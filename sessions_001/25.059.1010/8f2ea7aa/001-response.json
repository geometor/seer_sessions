            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task. Here's a breakdown of my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The primary element is the presence of \"objects,\" which are contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. The transformation appears to involve a form of reflection or expansion of these objects, creating a mirrored or symmetrical pattern. The background (0, or white) seems to act as a passive element. The size of the grid may also play a key role.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It will likely require analyzing object's position relative to grid edges or center and consider all training examples.\n3. **Reflect/Expand:** Create a mirrored/expanded version in multiple steps:\n   - reflect an image of the original object across its vertical and horizontal central axes within the grid.\n   - reflect the resulting object(from last step) accross both diagonals of the grid.\n4. **Output Grid:** Place the reflected/expanded shapes, ensuring that colors and relative positions are consistent, onto a new grid with the same dimensions. Maintain background as white/0.\n\nIn summary, the core idea revolves around the concept of reflecting original blocks, possibly diagonally. The precise logic for how that axis is selected and implemented in code is not immediately obvious - it will require iterative analysis and will likely be clarified in the coding phase with more examples.\n"
