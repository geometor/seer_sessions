The primary element is a shape formed by connected pixels of color '6' (magenta) on a background of color '0' (white). The transformation seems to involve expanding the original magenta shape and creating new disconnected magenta shapes in the output. The size of the input and output grids appear to be the same, 9x9.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
