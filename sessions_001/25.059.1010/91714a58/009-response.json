The input grid contains a seemingly random distribution of colors, while the output grid appears to be mostly blank (filled with 0s) except for a rectangular block of magenta (6) pixels. This suggests a selective filtering or extraction process. The position of the magenta block seems related to similar shaped blocks in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
