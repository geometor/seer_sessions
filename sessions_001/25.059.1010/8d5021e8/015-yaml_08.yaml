facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x2
    elements: [0, 5]
    description: Initial pattern or seed.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 9x4
    elements: [0, 5]
    description: Expanded and replicated pattern derived from the input.
  - action: expansion
    type: spatial transformation
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
  - action: replication
    type: pattern repetition
    description: The pattern of the input, or a transformation of, is repeated.
  - relationship: input_output_size
    type: scaling
    description: The output grid dimensions are multiples of the input grid dimensions. 9/3 = 3 vertically and 4/2=2 horizontally
  - observation: symmetry
    type: geometric
    description: output is symmetrical around both the horizontal and vertical axes
