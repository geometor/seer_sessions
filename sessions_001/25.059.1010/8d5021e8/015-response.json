The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0 for white and 5 for gray). The input grid appears to be a \"seed\" or \"pattern\" that is expanded and replicated in the output grid. The spatial relationship between the gray pixels (5) in the input seems to be a key factor influencing the output. The output maintains symmetries.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
