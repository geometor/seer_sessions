Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements appear to be 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grids are consistently smaller than the output grids.  The transformation seems to involve expanding the input grid and rearranging the non-zero elements. The zero-valued pixels seem to act as a background or filler. The non-zero values are duplicated and mirrored to create a larger, symmetrical pattern in the output. The output grids have a very specific structure, with non-zero number appearing in the 4 corners of the larger output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D (rows, columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - color_map:  {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - color:  (derived from value and color_map)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: expand_grid
    description: Increases the dimensions of the grid.
  - name: replicate_pixel
    description: Duplicates a pixel's value to other locations.
  - name: mirror_pixel
    description: Creates symmetrical arrangement.
  - name: rotate_and_fill
    description: Creates new output based upon a 90-degree rotation and fills with zeros.

relationships:
  - input_grid: smaller, contains seed pattern
  - output_grid: larger, symmetrical pattern based on input
  - non_zero_pixels:  key elements, replicated and mirrored
  - zero_pixels: background, filler

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with values other than 0.

2. **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by a rule:
   - Output width = 2 * input width
   - Output height = 3 * input height
    
3. **Create the Corner Pattern:** For each non-zero pixel in the input grid:
    - Place the value into the Top-left quadrant
        - Original Input location (row, col) maps to the same (row, col) on the output
    - Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
        - Place the value into the Top-right quadrant.
    - Rotate the grid 180 degrees.
        - Place the value into the Bottom-right quadrant.
    - Rotate the grid 270 degrees.
        - Place the value into the Bottom-left quadrant.

4. **Fill Remaining Pixels:** Fill all remaining (unassigned) pixels in the output grid with 0.

Essentially, the transformation takes the input, expands it, copies each non-zero pixel to the 3 new positions created from rotating the grid 90, 180, and 270 degrees clockwise, and fills the background.
