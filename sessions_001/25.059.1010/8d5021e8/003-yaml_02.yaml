  - observation: azure_pixels (8) in the input appear to be replicated and form the border of a larger rectangle in the output
  - observation: white_pixels (0) in the input exist in a field of all white pixels in output, but expanded
  - observation: height_increase: input height (3) * 3 = output height (9).
