Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Reflect Horizontally:** The input grid is reflected horizontally. Imagine a vertical mirror placed to the right of the input grid; the reflection appears next to the original.
2.  **Reflect Vertically:** The combined grid (original and horizontal reflection) is then reflected vertically. Imagine a horizontal mirror placed below the combined grid; the reflection appears below.
3. **Expansion**: The output grid size is double the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # 1. Reflect Horizontally:
    # Use np.fliplr() to flip the input array along the horizontal axis (left-to-right).
    horizontal_reflection = np.fliplr(input_array)

    # Concatenate the original array and its horizontal reflection side-by-side.
    combined_horizontal = np.concatenate((input_array, horizontal_reflection), axis=1)

    # 2. Reflect Vertically:
    # Flip the combined array (original + horizontal reflection) along the vertical axis (up-to-down).
    vertical_reflection = np.flipud(combined_horizontal)

    # 3. Combine for Final Output:
    # Concatenate the combined_horizontal array and its vertical reflection.
    output_array = np.concatenate((combined_horizontal, vertical_reflection), axis=0)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists for the final output.
    return output_array.tolist()

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
