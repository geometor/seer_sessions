Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is expanded and reflected to create the output grid. The input grid (3x2) is expanded by a factor of 3 vertically and 2 horizontally, resulting in a 9x4 output grid. The expansion involves reflecting the original pattern along both the horizontal and vertical axes.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the input grid as a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Get dimensions of the input grid
    input_rows, input_cols = input_array.shape

    # Determine expansion factors (output grid is 9x4)
    vertical_expansion = 3  # 9 / 3
    horizontal_expansion = 2 # 4 / 2

    # Create reflected versions of the input array
    reflected_horizontal = np.fliplr(input_array)
    reflected_vertical = np.flipud(input_array)
    reflected_both = np.flipud(np.fliplr(input_array))

    # Concatenate horizontally to double the width
    row_1 = np.concatenate((input_array, reflected_horizontal), axis=1)

    # reflect the vertical

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
