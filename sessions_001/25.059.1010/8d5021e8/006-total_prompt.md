Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves expanding the input grid to create an output grid. The output grid's height is three times the input grid's height, and its width is twice the input grid's width. Azure (8) pixels in the input are replicated vertically to form the border of output. White (0) pixels are expanded to create white row between the border.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height = input_height * 3
    output_width = input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels
    for x in range(input_width):
      # find first and last azure in column
      azure_y = []
      for y in range(input_height):
        if input_grid[y,x] == 8:
            azure_y.append(y)

      # copy entire columns where azure was found
      if len(azure_y) > 0:
        for y in range(output_height):
          output_grid[y, x*2] = 8

    # fill every other horizontal line
    for y in range(output_height):
      if y % 3 == 1:
        output_grid[y,:] = 0
      if y % 3 == 2:
        output_grid[y,:] = 0
      if y % 3 == 0:
        for x in range(output_width):
          if output_grid[y,x] != 8:
            output_grid[y,x] = 0

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a partially correct understanding of the transformation. It correctly identified the role of azure (8) pixels and the expansion of the grid. However, it failed to accurately capture the pattern of replication and filling, especially the horizontal white lines and the doubling of columns with azure pixels, and inserting blank columns between. The results indicate that we need to adjust the logic related to how columns are replicated and how the white space is incorporated. The assumption about white space is only partially correct.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Examination:** We'll meticulously examine each input-output pair, focusing on the precise placement of azure and white pixels in the output. We'll specifically look at edge cases and variations in input.
2.  **Refine Replication Logic:** We need to correctly implement the column replication. The current logic seems to copy any column with an 8, but we need to determine if it copies and inserts a blank column, or if some other logic is at play.
3.  **Precise White Space Rule:** Determine the exact rule governing white spaces.
4.  **Iterative Improvement:** We'll modify the natural language program and regenerate the code, testing it against all examples after each iteration.

**Metrics and Observations (using `code_execution` conceptually - no actual execution here, but describing what I would do):**

I would use `code_execution` to generate reports for each input-output pair, specifically focusing on:

*   **Input Dimensions:** Height and width of the input grid.
*   **Output Dimensions:** Height and width of the output grid.
*   **Azure Pixel Locations (Input):** List of (row, column) coordinates for all azure pixels in the input.
*   **Azure Pixel Locations (Output):** List of (row, column) coordinates for all azure pixels in the *expected* output.
*   **White Pixel Locations (Output):** List of (row, column) coordinates for all white pixels in the *expected* output.
*   **Mismatched Pixels:** A comparison between the generated output and the expected output, highlighting any discrepancies (using a difference map, for instance).

**Example-Specific Observations (from provided images - no code execution):**

*   **Example 1:** Input has azure pixels forming vertical lines. Output has these lines replicated, with a blank column inserted between them. White lines fill in the gaps vertically.
*   **Example 2:** Input has a single azure pixel. Output has a column of azure pixels with corresponding white space.
*   **Example 3:** Input has more complex azure layout, but the principle of vertical line replication and blank columns appear consistent, plus the inserted white rows.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: azure_line
    description: Vertical line of azure (8) pixels.
    properties:
      - continuous: True
      - color: azure (8)
      - orientation: vertical
    actions:
      - replicated: "Azure lines in the input are replicated in the output."

  - object: output_grid
    description: The expanded grid.
    properties:
      - height: "3 times the input height"
      - width: "2 times the input width"
    actions:
      - expanded: "The input grid is expanded to form the output grid."

  - object: white_line
    description: Horizontal line of white (0) pixels
    properties:
      - continuous: True
      - color: white(0)
      - orientation: horizontal
    actions:
        - inserted: "White lines are inserted between the replicated azure lines vertically."
  - object: blank_column
    description: Vertical columns of all 0 pixels
    properties:
        - color: white(0)
        - orientation: vertical
    actions:
        - inserted: "Blank columns are inserted between replicated azure lines horizontally."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The output grid's height is three times the input grid's height, and its width is twice the input grid's width.
2.  **Azure Replication:** For each column in the input grid containing *any* azure (8) pixels, create *two* columns in the output grid. The first new output column is a copy of the input column (where the azure pixel now extends down the entire height of the output). The second new output column is entirely white (0) pixels.
3.  **Horizontal White Lines:** Fill every row where `row_index % 3 == 1` with white (0) pixels in the output grid and fill every row where `row_index % 3 == 2` with all white(0) pixels. This will place horizontal white rows between each original row.

This refined natural language program more accurately describes the transformation. It corrects the oversimplification about azure replication and clearly defines the insertion of the horizontal and vertical white spaces.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
