            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against all training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example only. While it correctly identified some aspects of the transformation (expansion, azure replication, and horizontal white lines), it failed to generalize to other cases, specifically when azure is *not* present or how other colors should be handled. The core issue is that the initial program was overly specific to the presence of azure and didn't account for a more general rule governing the transformation of *all* pixels. The strategy to resolve these errors is to re-examine all examples, paying close attention to the relationship between *each* input pixel and its corresponding output region, and derive a more general rule that correctly transforms all colors.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis**\n\nTo gather accurate metrics, I will simulate code execution results for each input/output pair and summarize the findings. I will use `np.array_equal(transform(input_grid), output_grid)` to represent the code execution outcome.\n\n*   **Example 1:** `np.array_equal(transform(input1), output1)` - Expected: True, Observed: True\n*   **Example 2:** `np.array_equal(transform(input2), output2)` - Expected: True, Observed: False\n*   **Example 3:** `np.array_equal(transform(input3), output3)` - Expected: True, Observed: False\n\nHere is a summary:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Azure Present | Code Correct | Notes                                                                                                                  |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------ | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (3, 3)      | (9, 6)       | Yes           | True          | Original code based on this example.                                                                                   |\n| 2       | (3, 3)      | (9, 6)       | No            | False         | The output grid contains extended columns of color, not columns of azure, and white columns are not exclusively adjacent to azure.                |\n| 3       | (3, 3)      | (9, 6)       | Yes           | False         |  The output grid contains extended columns of color, and white columns are not exclusively adjacent to azure.|\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: (3, 3)\n      output_shape: (9, 6)\n      objects:\n        - color: azure (8)\n          input_positions: [(0, 0)]\n          notes: \"Azure pixel triggers column duplication.\"\n        - color: green (3)\n          input_positions: [(0,1), (0,2), (1, 0), (1,1), (1,2)]\n        - color: black (0)\n            input_position: [(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: (3, 3)\n      output_shape: (9, 6)\n      objects:\n        - color: yellow (4)\n          input_positions: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]\n          notes: \"No azure.

The pixel at (y,x) maps onto the output block at (3y, 2x).\n\n4.  **Color Propagation:** Fill the top-left pixel (3y, 2x) of the output grid's 3x2 block with the color of the input pixel (y,x). Fill the rest of the rows, so the result will have three rows of color.\n\n5. **White Rows Insertion:** Fill the two rows after the three rows with white.\n\nIn summary, the transformation takes *each* input pixel and expands it into a replicated column based on input color, which is then copied. It also inserts the white lines. Azure has no special significance beyond its color.\n"
