objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D (rows, columns)
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - color_map:  {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - color:  (derived from value and color_map)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: expand_grid
    description: Increases the dimensions of the grid.
  - name: replicate_pixel
    description: Duplicates a pixel's value to other locations.
  - name: mirror_pixel
    description: Creates symmetrical arrangement.
  - name: rotate_and_fill
    description: Creates new output based upon a 90-degree rotation and fills with zeros.

relationships:
  - input_grid: smaller, contains seed pattern
  - output_grid: larger, symmetrical pattern based on input
  - non_zero_pixels:  key elements, replicated and mirrored
  - zero_pixels: background, filler
