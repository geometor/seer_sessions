The input grid is 3x2, and the output grid is 9x4.  The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and azure (8). The azure pixels in the input seem to be triggering a replication and expansion in the output. The white pixels seem to be preserved, but expanded in number. The transformation creates a sort of border of azure pixels in output around white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically create rows of all white between rows where azure pixels are copied.\n\nIn simpler terms, the azure pixels in the input define a border in the output, by expanding vertically. The white pixels expand the image, making a larger interior of all white between the azure borders. The entire output grid is 3x the height, and 2x the width of the input grid.\n"
