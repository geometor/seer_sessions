Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is 3x2, and the output grid is 9x4.  The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and azure (8). The azure pixels in the input seem to be triggering a replication and expansion in the output. The white pixels seem to be preserved, but expanded in number. The transformation creates a sort of border of azure pixels in output around white pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 2] # height, width
    elements: [0, 8]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [9, 4]
    elements: [0, 8]
  - observation: azure_pixels (8) in the input appear to be replicated and form the border of a larger rectangle in the output
  - observation: white_pixels (0) in the input exist in a field of all white pixels in output, but expanded
  - observation: height_increase: input height (3) * 3 = output height (9).
  - observation: width_increase: input width (2) * 2 = output width (4)
  - relationship: output_grid is an expanded and altered version of the input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) and white (0) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Expand Dimensions:** Create a new output grid with dimensions three times the height and twice the width of the input grid.
3.  **Replicate and place border:** Each azure (8) pixel in input should expand to be a column of azure in the output.
4. **Fill internal:** The rest of the pixels in the output should be white (0). Specifically create rows of all white between rows where azure pixels are copied.

In simpler terms, the azure pixels in the input define a border in the output, by expanding vertically. The white pixels expand the image, making a larger interior of all white between the azure borders. The entire output grid is 3x the height, and 2x the width of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
