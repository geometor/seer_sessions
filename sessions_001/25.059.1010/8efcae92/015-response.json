The input grid is significantly larger than the output grid.  The primary colors involved seem to be blue (1) and red (2), with some white (0) in the input. The transformation appears to involve a significant reduction in size, and perhaps a focus on the arrangement of red (2) pixels within a predominantly blue (1) background. The output grid's dimensions seem unrelated to the input by any trivial proportion.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note that this does not mean the white pixels can simply be trimmed.\n\n2.  **Reduce Size:** Drastically reduce the size of the identified region to a much smaller grid. The new dimensions are not immediately obvious, but seem significantly condensed.\n\n3.  **Preserve Relative Red Positions:** While reducing the size, maintain the approximate relative positions of the red (2) pixels within the predominantly blue (1) background. The exact mapping of positions is not a direct scaling or simple sub-sampling, but rather a more complex transformation that preserves some spatial relationships.\n\n4.  **Output:** Output the reduced grid with blue and red pixels, capturing the essential red pixel arrangement.\n\nIn summary, the transformation extracts a \"core\" from the input grid, preserving relative red positions. It shrinks a region, not just the overall grid. The white portions do not seem to directly influence the output. The key challenge is figuring out *how* exactly this reduction and preservation of red positioning occurs.\n"
