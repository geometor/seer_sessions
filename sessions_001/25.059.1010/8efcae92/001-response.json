The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids and seem to contain a condensed or summarized representation of the input, retaining the relative positions of the red (2) pixels within a field of blue (1) pixels. The white (0) background is completely eliminated. The core operation seems to involve identifying connected components of blue and red, and recreating a smaller version of the input where only connected blue and the red pixels are maintained.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Initialize this grid to the largest blue region from the input.\n6. **Place Red Pixels:** Copy red (2) color from the filtered input (without white background) to the new grid respecting coordinates.\n7.  **Result:** output grid\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts and shrinks the parts of the input grid that are not the white background, keeping the spatial relationships between blue (1) and red (2) colored pixels. The process condenses and filters to produce the output, and there is a clear focus on the blue and red sub-regions.\n"
