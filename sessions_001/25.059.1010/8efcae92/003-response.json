The input grid appears to contain two distinct rectangular shapes composed of blue (1) and red (2) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels.  The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of only the colored parts of the input, specifically retaining the arrangement of blue and red pixels, but removing any white space and contracting the shape. The output shape appears to maintain the 2D structure, and all the colors, present in the sub region of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The colors, and 2D structure of non-white colors are preserved in this smallest possible output grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation isolates and extracts the core colored structure from the input grid, eliminating all surrounding white space, while preserving the 2D positioning of the colors.\n"
