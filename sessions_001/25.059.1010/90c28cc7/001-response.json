A block is defined as a contiguous region of pixels sharing the same color.\n2. **Find Representative Colors:** find all the distinct colors.\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid where the dimensions depends on number of distinct colors found in the previous step.\n4. **Populate with Colors**: populate output grid cells with the colors found in the step 2, it seems that the colors should respect the y axis of the blocks in the original figure.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies the distinct color blocks in the input grid and represents them on x,y grid in the output grid, the output grid represent the position of the first occurrence (top,left) of each different color.\n"
