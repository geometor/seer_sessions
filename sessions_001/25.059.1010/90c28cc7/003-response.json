The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) that seems to represent a summary or a distilled version of the input. The colors in the input grid appear in horizontal bands or stripes, and each band consists of a single repeating color for an extended stretch before transitioning. The output grid seems to capture a single representative color from each of these bands. The background is all 0 (white) but the program is not expected to copy it to the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore all rows which have color 0 (white) only.\n2.  **Extract Representative Color:** For each identified color band, take the first non-zero color encountered.\n3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill each row of this output grid with the representative colors extracted from each input color band, maintaining the top-down order. The output grid will therefore have as many rows as distinct and non-white horizontal bands.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the first non-zero color in each solid horizontal color band of the input grid, ignoring rows of all 0, and places these colors into a smaller output grid, maintaining the original order.\n"
