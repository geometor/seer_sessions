Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially mostly white (0) with some azure (8) pixels. The transformation seems to involve adding new blue (1) pixels based on the positions of the azure pixels, but not directly replacing them. The azure pixels remain in the output. There's a spatial relationship between the azure and blue pixels. Specifically, the blue pixels seem to appear below and separated from the azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - blue (1)
      position: [row, column]
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Azure pixels are present in the input and remain unchanged in the output. Blue pixels are added to the output grid.
  - type: positional_offset
    from: azure_pixel
    to: blue_pixel
    offset_y_min: 3 # at least a 3 row seperation
    offset_y_max: 5 # added rows seem to change per object
actions:
  - type: add
    object: blue_pixel
    condition: based on position of azure pixels

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve:** Copy entire input to output, keeping azure pixels.
3.  **Iterate:** For each contiguous horizontal block of azure pixels:
4.  **Calculate:** Add a horizontal line filled with blue pixels(1) that matches the same shape, width and starting row of the azure object.
5.  **Determine Row:** Find objects with an origin row (lowest y value) that is 4 or less, offset + 5. Find objects with row position 4-9, add row offset +3.
