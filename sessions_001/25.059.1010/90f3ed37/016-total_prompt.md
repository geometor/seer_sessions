Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The dominant colors are white (0) and azure (8).
*   The output introduces a new color: blue (1).
*   The azure (8) pixels appear in a checkerboard-like pattern in the input.
* The location of added blue pixels seems to be related to missing azure pixels in the input grid starting from row 6

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 15
      columns: 10
      cells: integers (0-9)
    observations:
      - input:  Checkerboard pattern of azure (8) on a white (0) background, primarily in the top rows.
      - output: Same checkerboard pattern as input, but with blue (1) pixels appearing in a pattern where '8' pixels are missing down the grid, beginning approximately halfway, where a 3x3 azure object should appear.

actions:
  - type: replace
    description: Replace some white (0) pixels with blue (1) pixels.
    constraints:
     - The replacement occurs where the '8' pixels are missing, starting from rows 6.

relationships:
  - input_grid: output_grid (modified)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Base Pattern:** Recognize the initial checkerboard pattern of azure (8) pixels on a white (0) background in the input grid.

2.  **Locate Modification Zone:** Begin checking at row 6

3.  **Apply Modified Pattern:** Scan, row by row, identify locations where azure would have completed a previous established 3x3 area of azure (8). If the location contains 0, change to 1, If it contains 8, keep 8.

4. **Maintain Grid dimensions** output grid is same size as input

In essence, the transformation preserves the existing azure (8) pixels and selectively introduces blue (1) pixels in the locations that follow the perceived checkerboard pattern established in the top section of the grid. The output shows the bottom part of the pattern being completed with color '1'.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
