The input grid contains several colored \"objects\", which appear to be rectangular blocks of pixels with the same color. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, retaining some of the original colors and their relative positions, but significantly reducing the overall size and removing large areas of white (0) pixels. There are four distinct colored regions with colors yellow(4), red(2), green(3), and azure(8). These objects appear important to solving the task.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The output grid's dimensions are significantly smaller than the input.\n5. **Place Objects:** Reconstruct the selected objects and the \"yellow bookends\" in the output grid, maintaining their relative spatial arrangement and original colors. Combine Red, Green, and Azure into a single 3x3 block where red and green are side by side and green and azure are side by side and all adjacent, forming an L-shape. Place this object relative to yellow bookends.\n\n"
