objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
      cells: contain color values (0-9)
  - type: square
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      size: variable (single cell or contiguous block)

actions:
  - name: crop
    description: Reduce the overall dimensions of the grid.

      adjacency: must be directly touching (horizontal or vertical)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Squares of the same color touching each other.
  - type: containment
    description: The output grid is a subset of the input grid (after cropping and condensing).
