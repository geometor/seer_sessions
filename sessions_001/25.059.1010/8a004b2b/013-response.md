Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains several colored "objects", which appear to be rectangular blocks of pixels with the same color. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, retaining some of the original colors and their relative positions, but significantly reducing the overall size and removing large areas of white (0) pixels. There are four distinct colored regions with colors yellow(4), red(2), green(3), and azure(8). These objects appear important to solving the task.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: yellow (4)
    positions: [[1, 2], [7, 2], [1, 8], [7, 8]] #input grid
    notes: "appears twice, corners of a larger rectangle?"
  - type: rectangle
    color: red (2)
    positions: [[2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 3], [3, 4]]
  - type: rectangle
    color: green (3)
    positions: [[13, 10], [14, 9]]
  - type: rectangle
    color: azure (8)
    positions: [[4, 5], [4, 6], [5, 5], [5, 6]]
  - type: background
    color: white (0)

actions:
    - type: select
      description: "Select colored objects."
    - type: condense
      description: "Reduce grid size, preserve important shape relations."
    - type: combine
      description: "Combine colored blocks that occupy the same relative space when overlapped."

relationships:
  - input_grid_size: 17x18
  - output_grid_size: 7x7
  - object_colors: [2, 3, 4, 8]
  - spatial: "Colored objects are non-overlapping in the input."
  - relative_position: "The output seems to maintain the general relative positions of the colored blocks and yellow bookends."

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct colored rectangular blocks within the input grid. Ignore the white (0) background.
2.  **Yellow Bookends:** Note two instances of the yellow (4) color. Imagine that the yellow objects mark the upper-left and bottom-right of a large bounding rectangle.
3.  **Combine/Overlap:** Imagine each 2x2 block of Red(2), Green(3), and Azure(8) are overlaid into the same space, such that the relative layout is Red-Green-Azure.
4.  **Condense:** Reduce the overall grid size. The output grid's dimensions are significantly smaller than the input.
5. **Place Objects:** Reconstruct the selected objects and the "yellow bookends" in the output grid, maintaining their relative spatial arrangement and original colors. Combine Red, Green, and Azure into a single 3x3 block where red and green are side by side and green and azure are side by side and all adjacent, forming an L-shape. Place this object relative to yellow bookends.
