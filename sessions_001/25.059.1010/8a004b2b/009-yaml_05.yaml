- objects:
    - color: blue
      shape: rectangle
      properties:
        - can_connect: true
        - connect_direction: horizontal and vertical
        - merge_condition: "adjacent and no other colors in between horizontally, contiguous vertically"
    - color: "[red, green, yellow, etc.]"  # Other colors
      shape: rectangle
      properties:
        - can_connect: false
        - preserve_position: true
- actions:
    - name: connect_blue
      inputs:
        - blue rectangles
      outputs:
        - connected blue rectangles
      rules:
        - "Connect horizontally if and only if all pixels between are white"
        - "connect vertically if and only if contiguous"
    - name: preserve_others
      inputs:
        - other colored rectangles
      outputs:
        - same rectangles in same relative positions
    - name: "compute_bounding_box"
      inputs: input grid
      outputs: top, bottom, left, right coordinates
      rules:
        - find min row with non-white pixel
        - find max row with non-white pixel
        - find min col with non-white pixel
        - find max col with non-white pixel
- context:
    - "Determine the smallest bounding box containing all the non-white pixels."
    - "Within that bounding box, combine specific blue blocks based on strict adjacency, and preserve other color blocks as is."
