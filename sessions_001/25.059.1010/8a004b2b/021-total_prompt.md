"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions (blocks) of non-zero colored pixels and single non-zero pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Crop Background:** Remove all rows and columns along the edges of the grid that contain only background color (0). Continue until a non-zero pixel is encountered on the outer edge.
3.  **Consolidate colored regions:** Find the regions that have color, 2 (red) and 3 (green) and set the color to the right-most color in the row.
4.  **Reposition Yellow Pixels:** Find all single pixels of color 4 (yellow). Locate the available corners in the grid, where "available" means a location that is currently the background color, 0. Move the pixels to the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners, in any order.
5. **Consolidate and Fill:** Take the 1, 2 and 3 colored regions and consolidate to the color that is at the right-most edge of each row.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
