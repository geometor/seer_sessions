            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a strategy for improvement, documented facts, and a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies colored rectangular blocks and attempts to reposition them in a smaller grid, using yellow as \"bookends.\" However, it's clear from the test results that the logic for positioning and overlapping the red, green, and azure blocks is too specific to the first training example and doesn't generalize. The output size is also hardcoded, which won't work for all cases.\n\nThe core issues are:\n\n1.  **Hardcoded Output Size and Positions:** The code assumes a 7x7 output and fixed positions for the colored blocks, which is incorrect for other examples.\n2.  **Incorrect Overlapping Logic:** The overlapping logic is specific to the first example and doesn't adapt to different block arrangements.\n3.  **Yellow Bookend Assumption**: Although a good initial observation, yellow does not always indicate the \"bookends\"\n4. The code completely ignores input example 3.\n\n**Strategy for Improvement:**\n\n1.  **Dynamic Output Size:** Determine the output grid size dynamically based on the relative positions and sizes of the input objects. The output grid should be the smallest possible that correctly reflects the object positioning.\n2.  **Relative Positioning:** Instead of fixed positions, use the relative positions of the objects in the input grid to determine their positions in the output grid. Maintain relative row and column order, and relative scale, if possible.\n3.  **Generalized Overlapping:** Implement a more general overlapping rule. It looks like the objects should be placed based on the colors of the objects and may be merged.\n4. **Refactor**: Improve the object extraction to handle the multiple objects of the same color.\n5. **Revisit assumptions**: After gathering more information, some assumptions may not be true.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nTo understand the transformations better, I need to analyze the dimensions and relative positions of objects in each input-output pair. I'll analyze the results of the code execution, along with visual inspection of the provided examples.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n-   Input: 22x17. Objects: Yellow (4), Red (2), Green (3), Azure (8). Yellow appears as two separate rectangles.\n-   Expected Output: 7x7.\n-   Actual Output: 7x7. Matches expected output.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n-   Input: 25x17. Objects: Yellow (4), Red (2), Green (3), Azure (8). Yellow appears as two separate rectangles.\n-   Expected Output: 9x9.\n-   Actual Output: 7x7. Incorrect size. The relative positions of the internal objects are wrong, but color overlaps are consistent with example 1.\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n-   Input: 13 x 13. Objects: Red(2), Green(3) and Azure(8)\n-   Expected Output: 5 x 5.\n-   Actual Output: 7x7. Incorrect size. The output should not contain yellow since it is not present in the input. Colors are correct, but relative positioning and overlap are not.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: \"c753e02b\"\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects: [yellow rectangle, yellow rectangle, red rectangle, green rectangle, azure rectangle]\n      input_object_relationships: [red above and left of green, green and azure overlap, green above and left of azure, yellow bookends diagonal opposites]\n      output_objects: [yellow, red, green, azure]\n      output_size: [7, 7]\n      transformations: [overlap colors, create smallest output grid to represent input objects]\n      object_color_priority: [yellow, red, green, azure]\n  - example_2:\n      input_objects:  [yellow rectangle, yellow rectangle, red rectangle, green rectangle, azure rectangle]\n      input_object_relationships: [red above green, green above and left of azure, yellow bookends diagonal opposites]\n      output_objects: [yellow, red, green, azure]\n      output_size: [9, 9]\n      transformations:  [overlap colors, create smallest output grid to represent input objects]\n      object_color_priority: [yellow, red, green, azure]\n  - example_3:\n    input_objects:  [red rectangle, green rectangle, azure rectangle]\n    input_object_relationships: [red above green, green above and left of azure]\n    output_objects:  [red, green, azure]\n    output_size: [ 5, 5 ]\n    transformations:  [overlap colors, create smallest output grid to represent input objects]\n    object_color_priority: [ red, green, azure]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct, contiguous colored rectangular blocks in the input grid.\n2.  **Determine Output Grid Size**: The size of the output grid changes based on the presence and position of the objects, including yellow.\n3.  **Yellow Bookends (Conditional):** If there are yellow blocks, they represent the outer corners of the scene and define the size of the output grid. Use the positions of the yellow blocks to represent the corners of the output.\n4.  **Relative Repositioning:** Translate the positions of other colored objects (red, green, and azure) to the output grid. Maintain the input grid's relative row and column order of objects when positioning.\n5.  **Color Priority Overlap:** When the objects overlap - combine the colors in this order: Yellow, Red, Green, Azure.\n6. If yellow is not present, then the output grid should still be constructed using the minimum bounding rectangle of the red, green and azure objects.\n\n"
