"""
1.  **Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangular region (bounding box) that encompasses all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid. This is defined by the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost non-white pixels.

2.  **Horizontal Blue Connection:** Within the bounding box, locate all blue (1) rectangles. If two blue rectangles are on the same row and every pixel between them is white (0), connect them by filling the intermediate pixels with blue (1). If any pixel in between is not white, do not connect.

3. **Vertical Blue Merge:** Within the bounding box, locate all blue (1) rectangles. If two blue rectangles are vertically contiguous, merge them.

4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All non-blue and non-white pixels within the bounding box must be preserved in the output grid, maintaining their exact relative positions and sizes.

5.  **Output Grid:** Create a new grid based on the bounding box size. Populate it by performing the blue connection/merging, and preserving other colors as described above.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
