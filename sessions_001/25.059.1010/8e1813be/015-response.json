The larger grid seems to have distinct horizontal bands of colors, with a central grey (5) block surrounded by other colors. The output grid appears to be a condensed representation, retaining only specific colored bands and omitting others, specifically the white (0) and gray (5) areas. It appears that only non-zero, and non-five, colored, horizontal lines are represented.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
