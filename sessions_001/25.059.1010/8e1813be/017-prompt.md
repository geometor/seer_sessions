Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves selecting specific rows from the input grid to form the output grid.
Rows that do not begin with 0 or 5 are kept.  All elements of the selected rows are included in the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid by selecting rows that do not start with 0 or 5."""

    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Initialize an empty list to store the selected rows
    selected_rows = []

    # Iterate through each row of the input array
    for row in input_array:
        # Check if the first element of the row is not 0 and not 5
        if row[0] != 0 and row[0] != 5:
            # If the condition is met, append the row to the selected_rows list
            selected_rows.append(row)

    # Convert the list of selected rows to a NumPy array
    output_array = np.array(selected_rows)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
