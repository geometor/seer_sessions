"""
1.  **Identify:** Find all horizontal lines (rows) in the input grid that consist of a single, uniform color. These are the "solid color lines".
2.  **Exclude:** Ignore any solid color lines where the color is 0 (white/background).
3.  **Select:** From the solid colored lines, select those that match the row indices of solid colored lines in the output.
4.  **Determine Output Length:** Observe the length of the lines in the output grid. This length is consistent for all lines within a single example.
5.  **Construct:** Create the output grid by taking the selected solid color lines from the input grid. Truncate or pad (with what?) each line to match the determined output length. In the examples, the lines are simply truncated.
