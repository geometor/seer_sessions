The most prominent visual feature is the presence of a vertical \"divider\" of grey (5) pixels in the input grids, always in the 5th column.  The output grids also retain the grey divider. The areas to the left and the right seem to be involved in a sort of exchange and mirroring operation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If they are the same color, they are not swapped.\n    - save the temp block as output_left_block.\n\n4.  **Right Block Transformation:**\n    - take columns 6-8 from the right block, reverse the *order* of the columns, and save them to the output_mid_block.\n    - Take columns 9-11 of the right block, reverse the *order* of the columns, and exchange each horizontal pair of *different colors* within each row, just like step 3, and save them to the output_right_block.\n\n5. **Combine:** Construct the output grid by combining output_left_block, the original divider column, output_mid_block and output_right_block.\n"
