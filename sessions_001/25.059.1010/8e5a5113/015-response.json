The input grid appears to be divided into two distinct sections: a left section with varying colors and a right section that is mostly gray and white. The output grid has a more complex structure, seemingly mirroring and inverting parts of the left section of the input, and including it on the right side.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The values are reversed in order along each row and rows reversed top to bottom.\n3.  **Invert Left Section**: Create an inverted version of the left section. The values are reversed in order within each row, with rows maintained in the original vertical sequence.\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   The first four columns of the output grid are identical to the left section of the input grid.\n    *   Columns 5, 6, and 7 of output grid corresponds to columns 4, 3, and 2 of input grid respectively.\n\t*\tThe final four colums(8, 9, 10, and 11) of output grid form the invert of the first four columns of the input grid.\n\nIn simpler terms: The left 4x3 section of the input is copied to the output. Then a vertically and horizontally flipped section of the original left section is inserted. Finally the left 4x3 section of the input is inverted and place in the final three columns.\n"
