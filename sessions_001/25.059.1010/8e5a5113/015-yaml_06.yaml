objects:
  - grid:
      properties:
        - dimensions: 3x11 (rows x columns)
        - cells: colored pixels (0-9, representing different colors)
      components:
          - left_section:
              properties:
                - dimensions: 3 x 4
                - description: Contains a variety of colors in the first four columns.
          - right_section:
              properties:

actions:
  - mirror:  Reflect a section of the grid.
  - invert: Reverse the order of rows and columns of an existing section.
  - combine: Place sections beside other section, merging the existing array with a new array.

relationships:
 - left_section:  Adjacent to the right_section in the input.
 - output_grid:  A combination of mirrored and inverted sections from parts of the input_grid.
