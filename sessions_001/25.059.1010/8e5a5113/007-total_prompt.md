Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Divide:** Mentally divide the input grid into two vertical halves. The left half contains colored pixels (blue, red, yellow), and the right half consists of grey and white pixels.

2.  **Mirror/Shift & Replace:** The right half of the *output* grid appears to take its structure of gray (5) pixels from the *input*, but with colors from left half replacing them based on the following:

    *   Locate all of the gray pixels. For any gray pixel in the input grid, the pixel will either be yellow, blue, or stay grey.
    *   Locate the white pixels. The white pixels will all be replaced with either the red or blue value.
    *   The left side colors are transposed onto the right side based on their original positions.

3. The overall shape of the gray color in the right side of the input remain the same and fixed.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
