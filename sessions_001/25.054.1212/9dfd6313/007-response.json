The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of some, but not all, of the colored pixels.  The white pixels (0) appear to act like a background or empty space, and the non-zero pixels are the primary actors. There's a definite spatial/geometric aspect to the transformation, as the positions of the colored pixels change. The input and output grids have different arrangements.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
