Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by integers. There are noticeable changes in the positions of some specific colors, while others remain unchanged. The overall grid dimensions (5x5) remain constant. The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), azure (8), red (2), blue (1), and white(0).

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [5, 5]
      elements: pixels
      element_type: integer
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
        - green (3)
        - yellow (4)
        - gray (5)
        - magenta (6)
        - orange (7)
        - azure (8)
        - maroon (9)

actions:
  - type: move
    description: Change the position of a pixel or a group of pixels.
  - type: retain
    description: keep some of the pixels in their original positions

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - type: adjacency
    description: some colored pixels have adjacent same colored pixels

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Horizontal Shift:** Move the azure (8) pixels to the top row, starting from the third column, and preserving the relative positions.
3. **Identify Second key pixels:** Locate all red (2) pixels.
4. **Horizontal Shift and expansion:** Move the red (2) pixels to the right end of the row where the azure pixels are placed, but expand if the red pixels were vertically adjacent by filling two columns on right.
5.  **Retain Other Pixels:** All other pixels retain their original positions in the grid.
