Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too specific, focusing only on swapping pixels at (0, 0) and (0, 1) if they are not white. The provided examples demonstrate a more complex diagonal pattern replacement. The strategy should involve identifying this diagonal pattern and correctly translating/rotating columns based on color matching in the first row.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Examine the `pixels_off` and visual differences between "Transformed Output" and "Expected Output" to understand the nature of the transformation. The images will be very helpful in recognizing the shifting and rotating.
2.  **Identify the Pattern:** Formulate a hypothesis about the rule governing the transformation that is not limited to the first two pixels. Look for diagonal structures.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to describe the more general diagonal object transformation.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 3x3
    *   Pixels Off: 2
    *   Observation: The '3' and '5' in the top-left 2x2 subgrid appear to have swapped, but this is too specific. The key is the diagonal. The first column became the main diagonal. The 5 at 0,0 moves to 0,0. The 3 at 1,0 moves to 1,1. the 0 at 2,0 moves to 2,2.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 4x4
    *   Pixels Off: 6
    *   Observation: The first column is now the main diagonal.
        - Column 0 becomes main diagonal: (0,0)->(0,0), (1,0)->(1,1), (2,0)->(2,2), (3,0) -> (3,3). The remaining columns shift left, wrapping.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 5x5
    *   Pixels Off: 10
    *   Observation: Same pattern. First column to main diagonal and columns shift/wrap left.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: 002
  - objects:
      - description: grid of colored pixels
      - properties:
          - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All possible colors
          - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
  - actions:
      - description: Transform the grid based on its first column and top row.
      - details:
          - step_1: "The first column becomes the main diagonal of the output."
          - step_2: "The other columns are placed to the left of the current column, rotated downwards and wrapped if necessary."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Diagonalization of First Column:** The first column of the input grid becomes the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) of the output grid.

2.  **Column Shift and Wrap:** For each subsequent column in the input grid (starting from the second column), it is placed to the *left* of where it was in the input grid. The column indices rotate and wrap-around. The columns are copied unchanged.

In essence, the first column sets the main diagonal, and the other columns are shifted/rotated based on their horizontal position relative to the original location.
