The colors are represented by integers. There are noticeable changes in the positions of some specific colors, while others remain unchanged. The overall grid dimensions (5x5) remain constant. The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), azure (8), red (2), blue (1), and white(0).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
