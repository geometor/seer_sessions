            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for refining the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, identifying the core concept of expanding non-white pixels. However, the logic for expansion was too aggressive. It filled both the row *and* the entire remaining column from each non-white pixel, leading to overlaps and incorrect results in all examples beyond the most simple single object scenarios. The expected outputs demonstrate that each non-white pixel only extends its influence on its own row and on its own column, down to, but *not including* the next colored pixel (or the edge of the grid, if no other colored pixel exists). This \"blocking\" behavior of expansion needs to be implemented. The current implementation also did not follow the correct expansion behavior for multiple objects on the same row or column\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine the Expansion Logic:** Instead of filling the entire remaining row and column, the code should fill only up to the next non-white pixel in each direction (down and right) or to the edge of the grid, whichever comes first.\n\n2.  **Iterative Development:** Test the code after *each* significant change to ensure the fix for one example doesn't break another. We are learning to iterate!\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, highlighting key observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input has two non-white pixels (red, green).\n    *   The red pixel should fill its row to the right edge.\n    *   The red pixel should fill its column down to the row before the green.\n    *   The green pixel should fill its row to the right edge.\n    *  The green pixel should fill to bottom edge\n    *   *Error:* Overlapping fill from red and green.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input has one non-white pixel (magenta).\n    *   Magenta pixel should fill the rest of its row.\n    *  Magenta pixel should fill the rest of its column\n    *   *Error:* Although the column fill is small, it's still one too many.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input has two non-white pixels (azure, yellow).\n    *   Azure should fill its row.\n    *  Azure should extend down to before yellow row.\n    *  Yellow should fill its row\n    *  Yellow should fill its column\n    *   *Error:* Overlapping fills, similar to Example 1.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Three non-white pixels (azure, orange, magenta).\n    *   More complex interaction, highlighting the need for \"blocking\" of the fill.\n    *   *Error:* Incorrect fill interactions, especially with multiple colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: \"Non-white pixels initiate expansion.\"\n    type: \"object_behavior\"\n    object: \"non-white pixel\"\n    action: \"expand\"\n  - description: \"Expansion occurs to the right along the pixel's row.\"\n    type: \"expansion_direction\"\n    direction: \"right\"\n    constraint: \"row\"\n  - description: \"Expansion occurs downwards along the pixel's column.\"\n    type: \"expansion_direction\"\n    direction: \"down\"\n    constraint: \"column\"\n  - description: \"Expansion stops at the edge of the grid.\"\n    type: \"expansion_limit\"\n    limit: \"grid_edge\"\n  - description: \"Expansion of a pixel stops before another non-white pixel in its path.\"\n    type: \"expansion_limit\"\n    limit: \"other_non_white_pixel\"\n  - description: \"output dimensions are always same as input\"\n    type: size_constraint\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid filled with white pixels (0), identical in size to the input grid.\n\n2.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (color value not equal to 0).\n\n3.  **Iterate:** For each non-white pixel:\n    *   **Row Expansion:** Starting from the pixel's position, change the color of all pixels to the right, along the same row, to the color of the current pixel. Stop if you encounter another non-white pixel or the edge of the grid.\n    *   **Column Expansion:** Starting from the pixel's position, change the color of all pixels downwards, along the same column, to the color of the current pixel. Stop if you encounter another non-white pixel or the edge of the grid.\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid now represents the transformed image.\n"
