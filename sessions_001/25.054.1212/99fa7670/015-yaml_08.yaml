observations:
  - task_id: 014
  - objects:
    - description: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
      properties:
        - color: Defined by the pixel value (1-9).
        - original_position: (row, column) coordinates before any transformation.
  - actions:
    - name: Horizontal Expansion
      description:  A non-zero pixel's color replaces all 0 values in its row.
      scope: Row-level.
      precedence: Happens before fill-down.
    - name: Fill Down
      description: A non-zero pixel's color propagates vertically downwards from its original row.
      scope:  Column-level, limited to the original column of the non-zero pixel.
      precedence: Happens after horizontal expansion.
  - constraints:
     - Fill-down is constrained to the column of the original non-zero colored pixels.
