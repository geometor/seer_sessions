            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with an updated natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were on the right track but failed to accurately capture the nuanced interaction between horizontal expansion and fill-down operations. The code performs both operations independently, causing an \"over-expansion\" where colors spread incorrectly. The core issue is that the fill-down operation should only apply to the *original* non-zero pixels, not the ones created by horizontal expansion. The examples show the algorithm needs to consider horizontal expansion, but restrict vertical fill-down to the columns of original non-zero pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine the Fill-Down Logic:** Modify the code to ensure that the fill-down operation is strictly linked to the *original* positions of the non-zero pixels. This means storing the initial column positions and only using them for the vertical expansion.\n\n2. **Prioritize Operations**: Horizontal expansion is applied fully across a row, but the vertical \"fill-down\" is applied to a specific column.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Non-zero Pixels (original): (1, 2, red), (3, 1, green)\n    *   Expected Behavior: Red expands horizontally and then the original red column fills down. Green expands horizontally, then original green column fills down.\n    *   Observed Error: Fill-down affects columns where horizontal expansion happened.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Non-zero Pixels (original): (1, 1, magenta)\n    *   Expected Behavior: Magenta expands horizontally and then the original magenta column fills down.\n    *   Observed Error: Same as Example 1.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Non-zero Pixels (original): (1, 1, azure), (4, 3, yellow)\n    *   Expected Behavior: Similar pattern, horizontal expansion then restricted vertical fill.\n    *   Observed Error: Same as Example 1.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *  Input shape: (7,5)\n    *  Non-zero pixels: (1,2, azure), (3,1, orange), (5,2, magenta)\n    *  Expected Behavior: Similar to other examples\n    *  Observed Error: Same as other examples\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task_id: 014\n  - objects:\n    - description: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.\n      properties:\n        - color: Defined by the pixel value (1-9).\n        - original_position: (row, column) coordinates before any transformation.\n  - actions:\n    - name: Horizontal Expansion\n      description:  A non-zero pixel's color replaces all 0 values in its row.\n      scope: Row-level.\n      precedence: Happens before fill-down.\n    - name: Fill Down\n      description: A non-zero pixel's color propagates vertically downwards from its original row.\n      scope:  Column-level, limited to the original column of the non-zero pixel.\n      precedence: Happens after horizontal expansion.\n  - constraints:\n     - Fill-down is constrained to the column of the original non-zero colored pixels.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Non-zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (value 0). Record their color and original (row, column) position.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each non-zero pixel, set all pixels in its row to that pixel's color.\n\n3.  **Restricted Fill-Down:** For each non-zero pixel identified in step 1, starting from its *original* row and *original* column, fill downwards in that column with the pixel's color until the bottom of the grid is reached.  This fill-down only occurs in the columns where non-zero pixels originally existed.\n"
