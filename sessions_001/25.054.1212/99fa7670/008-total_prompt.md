## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 6 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC44366CB0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 6 6
0 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a single magenta (color value 6) pixel in the center, surrounded by white (color value 0) pixels. The output grid retains the central magenta pixel and adds two more magenta pixels: one to the right of the original, and one below it. The added pixels form a sort of "L" shape, or perhaps more abstractly, they propagate the initial pixel's color.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    element_type: integer (0-9)
  - object: pixel
    property: color
    values:
      0: white
      6: magenta
  - action: propagation
    source:
      object: pixel
      color: magenta
    target:
      - object: pixel
        location: right of source
      - object: pixel
        location: below source
  - observation: The initial single colored pixel is maintained
  - observation: The added pixels are the same color as the source pixel
  - relationship: adjacency created between the colored pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the magenta (color 6) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Maintain** this identified pixel at its location
3.  **Propagate** the magenta color to two empty cells:
    *   The cell directly to the **right** of the original magenta pixel.
    *   The cell directly **below** the original magenta pixel.
4.  All other cells remain unchanged.

Essentially, the program finds an existing colored pixel (magenta, specifically in this case) and extends it, forming a specific pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
