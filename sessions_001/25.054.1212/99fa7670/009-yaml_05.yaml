facts:
  - observation: Each example contains a grid of pixels.
  - observation: Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9).
  - observation: Each number corresponds to a specific color.
  - observation: Non-black (0) pixels act as seeds for propagation.
  - observation: Propagation occurs horizontally to the right, filling the remaining width of the grid for that row.
  - observation: Propagation occurs vertically downwards, filling the remaining height of the grid for that column.
  - observation: The output grid dimensions are identical to the input grid dimensions.
  - action: Find each non-black pixel.
  - action: For each non-black pixel, fill the rest of its row to the right with the same color.
  - action: For each non-black pixel, fill the rest of its column down with the same color.
