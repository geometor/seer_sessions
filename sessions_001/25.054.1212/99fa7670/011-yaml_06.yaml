  - type: object_identification
    description: Non-black pixels act as seed points for rectangles.
    seed_pixels:
      - example_1: [(1, 2), (3, 1)]
        colors: [2, 3]
      - example_2: [(1, 1)]
        colors: [6]
      - example_3: [(1, 1), (4, 3)]
        colors: [8, 5]
      - example_4: [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 2)]
        colors: [8, 7, 6]

  - type: transformation_rule
    description: Each seed pixel's color defines the color of an upper-left defined rectangle.
    details:
      - The rectangle extends to the right until it encounters another seed pixel or the image boundary.
      - The rectangle extends downwards until it encounters the another seed pixel or the image boundary.
      - If a pixel is part of more than one rectangle, the upper-left most seed pixel determines the final color.

  - type: error_analysis
    description: Current code propagates color down and right simultaneously, creating incorrectly sized shapes.
