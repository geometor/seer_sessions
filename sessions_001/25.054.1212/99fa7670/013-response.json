The input grid contains two distinct non-zero colored pixels: an azure (8) pixel and a gray (5) pixel, with the rest being white (0). The output grid shows these colored pixels expanding. The azure pixel expands horizontally to fill the rest of its row. The gray pixel fills the rest of *its* row. Additionally, both of the non-zero colors fill downward. The original locations of non-zero pixels remain the same, they simply grow in two directions.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
