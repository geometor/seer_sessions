            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies and preserves the yellow (4) region. However, it makes an incorrect assumption about filling *all* columns to the left of the yellow region with azure (8). The examples show a more complex interaction between the existing azure pixels and the yellow region. It appears azure pixels are being added or removed in a column-wise fashion, based on the presence and possibly the extent of pre-existing azure pixels and their relationship to the yellow region. The strategy will be to focus on a column-by-column analysis, considering the relationship between existing azure and yellow pixels, to determine how azure pixels fill each column.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Column-wise Processing:** Instead of a blanket fill to the left, process each column individually.\n2.  **Azure/Yellow Relationship:** Investigate how the presence and position of azure pixels in a column, relative to the yellow region, influence the output. It may depend on the count, position relative to yellow.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Azure handling:** The problem seems more to do with where azure is placed not the yellow.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution - will refine when implemented):**\n\nI don't have code execution capabilities here, but I'll outline what I'd *expect* to see if I could run code, and what I infer from the images.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Azure Count: 3\n    *   Output Azure Count: 6\n    *   Yellow region: \\[3,5,3,5]\n    *   Azure added in the columns to left, seems to fill them fully\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Azure Count: 5\n    *   Output Azure Count: 12\n    *   Yellow region: \\[3,5,5,7]\n    *   Azure exists on left and on right. Azure fills column on the right\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Azure Count: 3\n    *   Output Azure Count: 6\n    *   Yellow Region: \\[3,5,3,5]\n    *   Same as Example 1\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: azure\n        count: 3\n        positions: [(0,3), (1,4), (2,5)]\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: contiguous_region\n        bounding_box: [3, 5, 3, 5]\n    output_objects:\n      - color: azure\n        count: 6\n        positions: added to columns left of yellow\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: contiguous_region\n        bounding_box: [3, 5, 3, 5]  # Unchanged\n    actions:\n      - type: add\n        color: azure\n        location: columns left of yellow region\n        rule: fill_column\n  - example: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - color: azure\n        count: 5\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: contiguous_region\n        bounding_box: [3,5,5,7]\n    output_objects:\n      - color: azure\n        count: 12\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: contiguous_region\n        bounding_box: [3,5,5,7]\n    actions:\n      - type: add\n        color: azure\n        location: columns, conditions apply\n        rule: conditional_fill_column based on existing azure\n  - example: 3\n    input_objects:\n      - color: azure\n        count: 3\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: contiguous_region\n        bounding_box: [3,5,3,5]\n    output_objects:\n      - color: azure\n        count: 6\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: contiguous_region\n        bounding_box: [3,5,3,5]\n    actions:\n        - type: add\n          color: azure\n          location: columns left of yellow region\n          rule: fill_column\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Yellow Region:** Find the contiguous region of yellow (4) pixels and determine its bounding box. This region remains unchanged in the output.\n\n2.  **Process Columns Individually:** For each column in the grid, do the following:\n\n    * If any existing azure pixels exist to the right of the right most yellow pixel, fill entire column with azure pixels.\n    * If the column is to the left of the left most yellow pixel, and no existing azure exists to the right of yellow, fill entire column with azure.\n    *   Otherwise, the column remains unchanged.\n\n3. Preserve the yellow region.\n"
