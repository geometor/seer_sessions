Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors present are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). The transformation appears to involve a change in the configuration of the azure (8) pixels, while the yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged. Specifically, some azure pixels are duplicated, shifting the existing ones.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
