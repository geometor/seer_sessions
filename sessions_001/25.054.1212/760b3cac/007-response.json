The primary colors involved appear to be azure (8), yellow (4), and white (0). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (6x9). The azure and yellow regions seem to maintain their overall shape but undergo some form of modification. Specifically, the azure region in the top part of the grid appears to be the focus of the transformation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
