       The azure cluster is modified. The pixel at (0,3) moves two cells to the left and becomes (0,2).
       The original pixels at (1,4) and (1,5) remain.
       A new group of Azure colored pixels are added to the left of the original (1,4) and (1,5). Two azure colored pixels are added at (1,0) and (1,1).
       The original pixel at (2,3) becomes (2,2), moving one position to the left. The output grid now contains an additional 8 colored pixel at (2,3).

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The yellow cluster remains spatially constant. The azure cluster expands and shifts its location to the left.
  - type: unchanged
    description: background remains the same
