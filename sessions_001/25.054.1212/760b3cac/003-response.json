            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, focusing on preserving the yellow region and attempting to handle the azure pixels. However, it's clear the logic for the azure pixels is incomplete and incorrect. It seems to be based on specific positions in the grid rather than a general rule. The code needs to be more flexible and adaptable to different arrangements of azure pixels. The key is to find the relationship between yellow and azure objects, then use this relationship to perform the transformation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples:** Carefully examine all three examples, paying close attention to the relative positions of the yellow and azure pixels. Look for consistent patterns in how the azure pixels are moved or added.\n2.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Develop a more robust hypothesis about the transformation rule. Consider concepts like:\n    *   Is there a \"source\" region for the azure pixels?\n    *   Is the movement/addition of azure pixels related to the position of the yellow region?\n    *   Are there constraints on where the azure pixels can be placed?\n    3. **Natural Language Program:** Focus on making it independent of specific indices\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of the metrics and observations from the provided examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 6x9, Output: 6x9.\n    *   Yellow region remains unchanged.\n    *   Azure pixels appear to be added/moved to the left, filling some columns partially.\n    * **One pixel off:** The azure at (0,2) should exist\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 6x9, Output: 6x9.\n    *   Yellow region remains unchanged.\n    *   Azure behavior is different from Example 1.\n    * **15 pixels off**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 6x9, Output: 6x9.\n    *   Yellow region remains unchanged.\n    *   Azure behavior, different again.\n    * **5 pixels off**\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: yellow_region\n    description: A connected component of yellow (4) pixels.\n    properties:\n      - shape: Irregular, determined by connectivity.\n      - behavior: Remains unchanged during the transformation.\n  - object: azure_pixels\n    description: Pixels with the color azure (8).\n    properties:\n      - initial_location: Scattered throughout the grid.\n      - final_location: transformation seems to relate to distance from yellow pixels\n      - behavior: Undergo a transformation, likely involving movement or addition.\n  - transformation:\n    description: The process that modifies the input grid to produce the output grid.\n    rules:\n      - rule_1: Preserve the yellow_region.\n      - rule_2: Transform the azure_pixels based on their original and/or yellow object location.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Yellow Region:** Locate the contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels. This region will remain unchanged in the output.\n2.  **Process Azure Pixels:** The azure pixels (8) will have to be added to output conditionally.\n\nThe azure pixels must move to columns to the left of the yellow region:\n- count how many columns to the left\n- starting at the top row\n- add azure pixels to the columns to the left until filled or the end of the left columns is met\n\n3. Create the output to match these rules\n"
