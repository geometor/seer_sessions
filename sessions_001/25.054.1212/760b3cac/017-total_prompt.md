"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all pixels that are azure (8) and group them as a single object. Find all pixels that are yellow (4) and group them as a single object.
2.  **Yellow Object:** The yellow object remains unchanged in its original position and shape.
3.  **Azure Object:**
    *   Find the minimum and maximum row and column of the bounding box around the azure object.
    *   Copy the Azure object.
    *   If the minimum column of the Azure object is > 0, expand the Azure object to fill the area from column 0 to one less than the original minimum column.
    *   If the maximum column of the Azure object is < input_grid.shape[1] - 1, copy and paste each column from the bounding box starting at the first column after the bounding box until it is filled.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
