## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 8 0
0 8 0 8
0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7BFC47F93EB0>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7BFC475021D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input is a 3x4 grid, and the output is a 6x8 grid. The primary colors involved are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or duplication of the input grid, with a specific pattern related to the azure pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x4.
  - observation: Output grid is 6x8.
  - observation: Input grid contains white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
  - observation: Output grid contains white (0) and azure (8) pixels.
  - observation: The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions.
  - object: Azure (8) pixels in the input.
  - relationship: Azure pixels in the input seem to dictate azure pixel placement in a patterned, expanded format in the output grid.
  - action: expansion, duplication of input grid, with potential rule based offset.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** The input grid's dimensions are doubled to create the output grid (height x2, width x2).

2.  **Replicate and Offset:**
    *   Every original azure (8) pixel location in input is replicated at four different locations in output grid.
    *   If we consider the output grid is divided in 2x2 subgrids.
    *   The azure (8) pixels are present at the bottom right cell in 2x2 subgrid that corresponds to its position in input grid.
    *   The remaining azure (8) pixels are present at the top left cell in adjacent 2x2 subgrids in output.

3.  **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in the output grid, not occupied by azure, are filled with white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
