Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Double Dimensions: The output grid has double the height and double the width of the input grid.
2. Pixel Replication: For every pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid.
3. Color Matching: The 2x2 block in the output grid has the same color as the corresponding pixel in the input grid. The top-left pixel of each 2x2 block has a direct mapping with input pixel.
4. Iteration order: The actions are performed by iterating each row, and then each column of the input grid, which corresponds to a top-left to bottom-right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
