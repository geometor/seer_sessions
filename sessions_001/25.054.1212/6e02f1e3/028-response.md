"""
The program takes an input grid of size 3x3 and creates an output grid of the same dimensions.
The program identifies a diagonal. It colors elements of the diagonal gray (5).
The identified diagonal can vary:
- main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right)
- anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left)
- both main and anti-diagonals (all)

All the other elements, not part of the identified diagonal are colored white(0).
The input grid content doesn't influence the output, only dimensions which remain the same.
