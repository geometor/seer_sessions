## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 3 3
4 2 2
4 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A601C0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A61D20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid. The input grid contains colors represented by numbers (3, 4, 2 - green, yellow, red), while the output grid uses different numbers (0, 5 - white, gray).  The transformation doesn't seem to simply map one color to another directly (e.g., green isn't always becoming white). It's likely a conditional transformation based on the color and/or position of the pixels. There's a noticeable change in the color set.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [3, 4, 2] # Green, Yellow, Red
    output_colors: [0, 5]    # White, Gray
  - observation: "The transformation is not a simple one-to-one color mapping."
  - observation: "The output grid only consists of two colors, 0 and 5, where the original had 3, 4, 2."
  - relationship: input_grid -> output_grid
  - transformation_type: conditional
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color value of the current cell.
3.  **If** input is color `3` (green), then the corresponding output is `0` (white).
4.  **If** input is color `4` (yellow), then the corresponding output is `0` (white).
5. **If** input is color `2` (red), then the corresponding output is `5` (gray).

Essentially, the colors Green and Yellow are transformed to White and Red is converted to Gray.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
