            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for moving forward, documented facts, and a natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code only analyzes the examples; it doesn't actually implement any transformation. The `transformed` output in the examples seems to be manually created and sometimes *incorrect*, judging by the `expected` output. This makes the analysis misleading. My primary goal is to understand the *actual* transformation rule by observing the input and *expected* output pairs. The provided \"transformed\" outputs are unreliable and should be disregarded.\n\nThe initial strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Ignore 'transformed'**: Focus solely on `input` and `expected` output pairs.\n2.  **Identify a Consistent Pattern**: Look for relationships between input and expected output across *all* examples.  The previous assumption that only one example was sufficient was overly optimistic.\n3.  **Formulate a Simple Rule**: Start with the simplest possible explanation, and only add complexity if necessary.\n4. **Develop Code:** Implement the natural language program in python.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Ignoring 'transformed')**\n\nI will manually review the examples to generate metrics to develop the reports. No code execution is necessary.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid of 2s and 3s.\n    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid of 5s and 0s. 5s appear where the input had either a 2 or a 3. 0 appears where there were no original values, forming a cross pattern.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid of 3s, 4s, and 2s.\n    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid of 5s and 0s. 5 appears to replace any non-zero input.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid of all 4s.\n    *   Expected Output: Top row is all 5. Others are 0.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid of all 3s.\n    *   Expected Output: Top row is all 5, others are 0.\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with 4s in the top two rows and 3s on the bottom row\n    *   Expected Output: 3x3 of 5 and 0.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      All inputs are 3x3 grids.\n  - observation: |\n      All outputs are 3x3 grids.\n  - observation: |\n    Input grids contain values between 2 and 4 inclusive.\n  - observation: |\n    Output grids contain only values 0 and 5.\n  - observation: |\n    In some examples, all non-zero input colors are changed to 5 in\n    specific positions.\n  - observation: |\n     In examples 3 and 4, only the first row is 5 and the rest is 0.\n  - observation: |\n     Examples 1, 2, and 5 show a cross pattern, with the output as 5.\n  - action: |\n      Non-zero input pixels are replaced with 5, and 0 is placed to form a cross pattern.\n  - exception_rows: |\n    If the input grid consists of all the same color, only the top row becomes 5 and the other pixels are zero.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Check for Uniform Input:** If all pixels in the input grid have the same color, create an output grid where the top row is all 5s, and all other pixels are 0s.\n2. **Cross Pattern**: Otherwise, create an output where any non-zero input produces a 5 and zeros are placed between to form a cross.\n\nThis two-part rule covers all observed examples, handling the \"all same color\" cases as a special condition.\n"
