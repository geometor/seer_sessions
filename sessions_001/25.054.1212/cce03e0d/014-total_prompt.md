## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 1 2
0 2 1
2 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC443EDC60>

**output:**
```
2 1 2 0 0 0 2 1 2
0 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 1
2 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0
0 0 0 2 1 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0
2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC48A63190>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Output:** A 9x9 grid, also of single-digit integers (colors).
*   **Pattern:** The input grid appears to be replicated and embedded within a larger grid of zeros. Specifically, the input is repeated in a 3x3 pattern to fill the output grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Represents a pattern of colored pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-9)
    description: Contains the replicated input pattern within a background of zeros.
  - relation: replication
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The input grid is replicated in a 3x3 tiled pattern to form the core structure of the output grid.
  - property: background
    value: 0
    description: The value (color) used to fill the cells of the output grid not occupied by the replicated input pattern.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled entirely with zeros.
2.  **Replication:** Copy the 3x3 input grid.
3.  **Tiling:** Embed the copied input grid into the output grid at the following positions, where (row, col) are the top-left coordinates of the embedded grid: (0,0), (0,6), (3,3), (6,0), (6,6) and (0+i*3, 0+j*3) for i in \[0,1,2] and j in \[0,1,2].

In essence the program can described as:

The program takes a 3x3 input grid and creates a 9x9 output grid, The ouput consists of tiling the input grid in a 3x3 formation and using '0' for every other cell.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
