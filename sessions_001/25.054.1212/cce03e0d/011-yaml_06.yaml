observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      colors: [0, 1, 2]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 9x9
      colors: [0, 1, 2]
  - action: replication
    description: The input grid is replicated within the output grid.
  - action: placement
    description: The placement of the replicated input grid is not consistently top-right and bottom-left. Example 2 shows the correct result with Top Right and Bottom Left, while example 1 and 3 show that the top-left block should also contain a replication of the Input grid.
  - pattern: output_size
    description: The output grid is always 9x9, which is 3 times the size of the 3x3 input grid.
