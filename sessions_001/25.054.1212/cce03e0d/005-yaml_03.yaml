objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - color: varies per cell
  - output_grid:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 9x9
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        - color: varies per cell

actions:
  - copy:
      source: input_grid
      destination: output_grid
      properties:
        - placement: specific regions of the output_grid, based on input grid position
  - fill:
      area: output_grid (non-copied regions)
      value: 0  # Represents the color white
      properties:
          - context dependent positioning

relationships:
  - input_to_output: The output grid is a transformation of the input grid, consisting of copies and filled regions.
  - spatial_relationships: The placement of copies within the output grid is related to the original input grid position and other blank regions
