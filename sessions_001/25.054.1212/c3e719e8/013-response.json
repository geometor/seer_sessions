The input grid appears to be a 3x3 matrix of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The output grid is a 9x9 matrix. The output grid seems to be composed of multiple copies of the input grid, along with a large area filled with zeros (white color). The input grid seems to be replicated in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right corners of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
