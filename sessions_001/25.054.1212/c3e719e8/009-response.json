            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a misunderstanding of the pattern. It correctly identified the 3x3 tiling of the input but incorrectly placed the zeros in the center. The actual pattern involves placing zeros around the *entire border* of *each* tiled section of the output. The provided examples make it clear that a central 3x3 block of zeros is not the correct interpretation of the pattern. Instead, the zeros are forming borders.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue is the placement of the zeros. Instead of a central block, we need to zero out the appropriate rows and columns to create borders *around* each instance of the original input grid within the tiled output. We will need to iterate through each tile and blank its border.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (9, 9)\n    *   Error: Zeros are in the center, not the borders of each tiled block.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (9, 9)\n    *   Error: Zeros are in the center, not the borders.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (9, 9)\n    *   Error: Zeros are in the center, not the borders.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 008_border_zeros\nexamples:\n  - input_shape: (3, 3)\n    output_shape: (9, 9)\n    tiling: 3x3\n    border_color: 0 # white\n    border_width: 1\n    description: \"The input grid is tiled 3x3.  Each tile's border is set to color 0.\"\n\n  - input_shape: (3, 3)\n    output_shape: (9, 9)\n    tiling: 3x3\n    border_color: 0\n    border_width: 1\n    description: \"The input grid is tiled 3x3. Each tile's border is set to color 0.\"\n\n  - input_shape: (3, 3)\n    output_shape: (9, 9)\n    tiling: 3x3\n    border_color: 0\n    border_width: 1\n    description: \"The input grid is tiled 3x3. Each tile's border is set to color 0.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Tile the Input:** Create a 3x3 tiling of the input grid. This means replicating the input grid nine times in a 3x3 arrangement.\n2.  **Border Each Tile:** For each of the nine tiles in the output grid:\n    *   Set the top row of the tile to 0.\n    *   Set the bottom row of the tile to 0.\n    *   Set the leftmost column of the tile to 0.\n    *   Set the rightmost column of the tile to 0.\n3. return the result\n\nThis process effectively creates a border of zeros around each replicated instance of the input grid within the larger output grid.\n"
