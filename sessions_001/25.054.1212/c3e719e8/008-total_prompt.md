## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 6 8
3 3 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC44367820>

**output:**
```
8 6 8 0 0 0 8 6 8
3 3 8 0 0 0 3 3 8
8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 6 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8
8 6 8 8 6 8 8 6 8
3 3 8 3 3 8 3 3 8
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC44367EE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid seems to be replicated and expanded upon, with a central area filled with zeros. The colors (represented by numbers) from the original input grid are preserved in their relative positions within the expanded grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: [8, 6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8]
      - colors: [azure, magenta, azure, green, green, azure, azure, azure, azure]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - values:  (contains original input grid values, expanded and with a central 3x3 area of zeros)
      - colors: (mirrors input colors in expanded sections, with a white central area)
  - action: expansion
    description: The input grid is replicated to form a larger grid.
  - action: infill
    description: A central area of the expanded grid is filled with zeros (white color).
  - relationship: input_to_output
    description: The output grid is a patterned expansion of the input grid with a zero-filled center.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replicate:** Create three copies of the input grid, both horizontally and vertically. This creates a 3x3 arrangement of the input grid resulting in a grid with dimension 9x9.
2.  **Identify Center:** Determine the central 3x3 subgrid within the expanded 9x9 grid.
3.  **Infill:** Replace all values within the central 3x3 subgrid with zeros (representing the color white).

Essentially the output is the original grid repeated in a 3x3 pattern with a blank space inserted into its center.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
