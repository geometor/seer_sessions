```python
"""
1.  **Identify Non-zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels within the input grid that have a value other than 0.
2.  **Preserve Row-wise Order:** Maintain the original left-to-right order of these non-zero pixels *as they appear within each row*.
3.  **Move to Bottom:** Move the identified non-zero pixels to the bottom-most available rows of the output grid.
4.  **Row-wise Filling:** When placing pixels in the output grid, prioritize filling the lowest available row. Within that row, place pixels from the same input row in their original order. If pixels from a higher input row need to be placed, and there are still empty positions on rows that had non-zero pixels on lower rows of input, fill the lowest of available rows.
5.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid (those not occupied by moved non-zero pixels) with 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
