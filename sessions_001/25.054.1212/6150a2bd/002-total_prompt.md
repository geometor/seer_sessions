## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48DA7F40>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48C33160>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9). Each number can be associated with a color, as per the provided `COLOR_MAP`. The transformation appears to involve a rotation or mirroring of the grid elements. The colors/numbers are preserved, but their positions change.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color-coded (based on COLOR_MAP)
actions:
  - type: positional transformation
    description: Elements within the grid change positions.
    details:  Appears to be a rotation or reflection.
relationships:
  - element-to-color: Each integer corresponds to a specific color.
  - element-to-position: Each element occupies a specific row and column in the grid.
  - input-to-output:  The set of elements remains constant; only positions change.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves rotating the input grid by 180 degrees clockwise (or counter-clockwise, as both result in the same transformation for a 180-degree rotation) to produce the output grid. This means the element in the top-left corner of the input becomes the bottom-right corner of the output, the top-center becomes the bottom-center, the top-right becomes the bottom-left, and so on. The operation swaps the position of the element at i,j index location with (n-1-i, m-1-j) where n and m represents total rows and columns.

Another equivalent interpretation of the program can be mirroring the grid, where the process would mirror on vertical axis and horizontal axis.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
