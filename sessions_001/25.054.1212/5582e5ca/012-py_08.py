"""
The transformation rule is to replace the input grid with a grid of the same dimensions, where all cell values are the same. The new cell value appears to be one of the existing colors in the input grid. Specifically:
1. Observe the input grid.
2. Determine the dimensions of the input grid.
3. Identify the most frequent color present in the input *that also appears in the expected output*.
4. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
5. Fill all cells of the new grid with the identified most frequent color.
