The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions, with some of the colors changed. The key difference seems to be the replacement of '1' (blue) pixels with '2' (red) pixels. The '0' (white) pixels remain unchanged. The output grid is two rows taller than the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
