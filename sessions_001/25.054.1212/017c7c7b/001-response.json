The integers represent different colors. The input grid has two colors (0 and 1, which map to white and blue), and the output grid has two colors (0 and 2, white and red). The output grid is the same size as and appears to derive from the input grid. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (6 rows x 3 columns).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The program takes the input, replaces blue for red and outputs that.\n"
