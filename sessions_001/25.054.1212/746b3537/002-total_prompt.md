## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1
2 2 2
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A950>

**output:**
```
1
2
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x192 at 0x7BFC4890B850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of colored pixels into a 1D grid (a column) of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single digits (1, 2). The dimensions of the grid change from 3x3 to 3x1. The spatial arrangement of the colors is altered in the transformation. The core operation seems to be a reduction in dimensionality, preserving the vertical order but losing the horizontal information.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: [blue, red]
      - value: [1, 2]

  - name: output_grid
    type: 1D_grid
    dimensions: 3x1
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: [blue, red]
      - value: [1, 2]

actions:
  - name: reduce_dimension
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: "Transforms a 2D grid into a 1D grid by extracting the first column."

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    via: reduce_dimension
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation extracts the leftmost column of the input grid and uses that as the output grid. The program takes a 3x3 grid and reduces it to a 3x1 grid, effectively taking the first column of the input and presenting it as a single column output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
