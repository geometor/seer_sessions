## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0
2 2
2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x192 at 0x7BFC48A60820>

**output:**
```
0 2 2 0
2 2 2 2
0 2 2 0
0 2 2 0
2 2 2 2
0 2 2 0
0 2 2 0
2 2 2 2
0 2 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC475013F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid (3x2) of colored pixels into a larger grid (9x4) of colored pixels. The colors involved are red (2) and white (0). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The pattern seems to involve repeating and mirroring the input, possibly with some adjustments to the dimensions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x2
    elements: [2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0] # Flattened representation
    colors: [red, white]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x4
    elements: >
      [0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0,
      0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0] # Flattened representation
    colors: [red, white]

relationships:
  - type: expansion
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The input grid is expanded and patterned to create the output grid.

actions:
  - name: repeat_and_mirror
    description: >
      The input pattern appears to be repeated both horizontally and vertically,
      with a possible mirroring effect.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Enlarge the Canvas:** Expand the input grid's dimensions. The height is tripled (3 -> 9), and the width is doubled (2 -> 4).

2. **Mirror Horizontally:** Take the first column of the input and use is as the second column of the output grid. The input original is at the right.

3.  **Mirror Vertically:** The pattern is repeated three times vertically. The second column from input is mirrowed in columns 1 and 3, while the first column from input is mirrored in column 4.

4. **Color Preservation**:Maintain all existing colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
