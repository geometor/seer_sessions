## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0
0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0 6 0
3 3 3 0 4 4 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x320 at 0x7BFC47F93880>

**output:**
```
4 4
4 4
4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x192 at 0x7BFC47F93430>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels, where each color is represented by a digit (0-9). The output appears to be a smaller grid containing only one color from the input grid. The size and shape of the output grid are significantly different from the input. The example shows distinct colored regions (objects) in the input. The most prominent colors, besides white (0), are green (3), yellow (4), and magenta (6). The output grid consists solely of yellow (4) pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 10x5 grid (width x height).
  - observation: Output is a 2x3 grid (width x height).
  - objects:
      - name: green_object
        color: 3
        shape: irregular
        initial_position: top-left quadrant
      - name: yellow_object
        color: 4
        shape: rectangle
        initial_position: center
      - name: magenta_object
        color: 6
        shape: line
        initial_position: top-right corner
  - actions:
      - type: select
        target: yellow_object
        reason: unknown
      - type: extract
        target: yellow_object.color
        reason: unknown
      - type: create_grid
        dimensions: [2,3] # width, height
        fill_color: yellow_object.color
        reason: unknown
  - relationships:
    - output_contains_only: yellow_object.color

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of the same color in the input grid. These are separate objects.
2.  **Select Object:** Select the yellow (4) object. The criteria for selection are not yet apparent.
3.  **Extract Color:** Get the color value of the selected object.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with dimensions 2x3 (width x height).
5.  **Fill Grid:** Fill every cell of the new grid with the extracted color (yellow/4).

The critical missing piece of information is *why* the yellow object is selected. Other properties to examine are object size, and object shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
