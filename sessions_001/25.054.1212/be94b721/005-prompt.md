Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of non-white pixels in the input grid. Each of these regions is an "object".
2.  **Select Target:** Examine the objects, excluding any objects that are adjacent to the edge of the input grid. If, after excluding these edge objects, there are no objects, then pick the largest.
3.  **Isolate:** Discard all pixels that are not part of the target object.
4.  **Compress:** Remove all white (value '0') rows and columns that contain *only* white pixels. Effectively shrinking the grid to the bounding box that tightly encloses the target object. The result is the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
