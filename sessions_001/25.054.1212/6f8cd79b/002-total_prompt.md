## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475007F0>

**output:**
```
8 8 8
8 0 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475021D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid consists of all zeros (white pixels). The output grid has the center pixel remaining as zero (white), while all other pixels are changed to eight (azure).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    initial_state: all pixels are 0
    final_state:  center pixel remains 0, all other pixels become 8

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description:  pixels are arranged in a 2D grid

actions:
  - type: modification
    target: pixels
    description: change pixel value based on position
    rule:
      center: remains 0
      other: changed to 8
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the center pixel:** In a 3x3 grid, the center pixel is located at row 2, column 2.
2.  **Preserve the center pixel:** Keep the value of the center pixel as 0.
3.  **Modify other pixels:** Change the value of all pixels that are not the center pixel to 8.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
