## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 2 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 3 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 5 5 5 5 5
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6 6 6 6 6 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
8 8 8 8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x640 at 0x7BFC475872E0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 3
0 0 0 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 4 4 4 4
0 0 6 6 6 6 6
0 5 5 5 5 5 5
8 8 8 8 8 8 8
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x7). The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement of colored blocks, specifically a rotation. The colors themselves remain the same, but their positions change. There appears to be a consistent pattern in how the positions shift. There are some colors on the border.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10, 7]
      elements: pixels
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]

  - type: block
    properties:
      shape: contiguous region of same color
      color: integer (0-9)

actions:
  - type: re-arrange/rotate
    properties:
      direction: possibly 90 degrees clockwise. Need verification.
      scope: entire grid

relationships:
  - block_to_grid: blocks are contained within the grid
  - color_to_block: each block has a single color
  - input_output: output grid is a transformation of the input grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous blocks of the same color within the input grid.
2.  **Rotate** the entire grid clockwise by 90 degrees.
    -   Imagine the grid's top row becoming the rightmost column, the rightmost column becoming the bottom row, the bottom row becoming the leftmost column and the leftmost column becoming the top row.
    - the origin [0,0] would then be on the top right.
3.  **Place** the identified colored blocks in their new rotated positions within the output grid, maintaining their original colors and shapes.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
