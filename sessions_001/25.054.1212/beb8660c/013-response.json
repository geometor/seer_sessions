The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The colors in the input grid seem to be rearranged in the output grid. The bottom row (azure) remains unchanged. The other colors seem to swap positions, and some of the cells in the other rows of the grid get replaced by white, while some stay the same. It looks like it is a sort of rotation but with some color overwrites.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Overwrite the cell that now contains what use to be the top-left of the input with the background color (white or `0`).\n\nIn summary, leaving the bottom row unchanged, rotate the 2x2 top-right sub-grid defined by center pixel, one step clockwise, and replace cell with the color that used to be in top-left with background color (white/0).\n"
