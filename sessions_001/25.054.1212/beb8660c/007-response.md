Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a grid of colored pixels. The primary operation seems to be a rearrangement or shifting of colored blocks (contiguous pixels of the same color) within the grid. The colors themselves remain unchanged, only their positions are altered. There appears to be a downward movement of blocks, potentially filling empty spaces (represented by white pixels, value 0) below them.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x4 (rows x columns)
      - cell_values: [0-9] # Representing colors
  - type: block
    properties:
      - color: [blue, red, green, azure] # Determined by cell_values
      - shape: contiguous_pixels
      - movement: downward
      - constraint: within_grid_boundaries

actions:
  - name: shift_blocks_down
    description: Move blocks of pixels downward, filling empty spaces below.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Blocks can be above, below, or adjacent to other blocks or empty spaces.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains all blocks.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blocks:** Recognize all contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Shift Down:** Move each identified block downwards as far as possible. The block will stop moving down when it reaches the bottom edge, any non-zero pixel or when empty pixels on other rows are present.
3. **Preserve the bottom row:** The bottom row should always be fixed and it should not move.

In summary, the transformation rule is to "shift all contiguous non-zero color blocks down, filling the spaces, but keep the bottom row fixed.".
