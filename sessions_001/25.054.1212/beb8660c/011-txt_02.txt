- Input Shape: (7, 4)
- Output Shape: (7, 4)
- Match: False
- Pixels Off: 5
- Size Correct: True
- Color Palette Correct: True
- Correct Pixel Counts: True
- Observations: This is a simpler example, but still shows incorrect shifting.  The '1' (blue) pixel should end up above the '8's (azure), not overwrite one of the 2's. The code isn't correctly stacking.
