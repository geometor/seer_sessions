The input grid contains two distinct colors (0 and 5, which are white and gray), while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (3, which is green). The key observation is that the non-white color in the input (gray) is replaced, and all other colors are replaced as well, with the single green color in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
