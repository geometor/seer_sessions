The input grid contains the values 5 and 0, which map to gray and white pixels, respectively. The output grid contains the numbers 2 and 4, representing red and yellow pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in color/value based on the original pixel's position and color.  The gray pixels (5) in the input are changing to either red (2) or yellow (4). The white pixels (0) change to red(2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
