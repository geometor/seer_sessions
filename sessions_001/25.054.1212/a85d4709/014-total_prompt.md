## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 0 0
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93550>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47544AF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains the values 5 and 0, which map to gray and white pixels, respectively. The output grid contains the numbers 2 and 4, representing red and yellow pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in color/value based on the original pixel's position and color.  The gray pixels (5) in the input are changing to either red (2) or yellow (4). The white pixels (0) change to red(2).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 5
        color: gray
        positions: [[0,0], [1,1], [2,0]]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 2
        color: red
        positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
        positions: [[1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]
  - transformation: color_change
    details:
      - from: 5
        to: 2
        condition: "input grid gray pixel is on top or bottom row"
      - from: 5
        to: 4
        condition: "input grid gray pixel is on middle row"
      - from: 0
        to: 2
        condition: "input grid white pixel"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).

2.  **Iterate:** Examine each cell in the input grid.

3.  **Transform:**
    *   If the cell in the input grid is gray (value 5) AND is located in the middle row, change its value to 4 (yellow) in the corresponding cell of the output grid.
    *   If the cell in the input grid is gray (value 5) AND is located on the top or bottom row, change its value to 2 (red) in the corresponding cell in the output grid.
    *  If the cell in the input grid is white (value 0), change it's value to 2 (red) in the corresponding cell in the output grid.

4.  **Output:** The transformed output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
