Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain various colored pixels, with a prominent blue border (represented by '1'). The output grid seems to be a condensed version, retaining only certain colors from the input and seemingly ignoring the blue border. The positions and colors in output doesn't have obvious direct mapping based on position in input. It could be a kind of summarization or extraction based on color. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (8x8 input vs. 4x4 output).

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a grid of 8x8 pixels.
  - observation: Output is a grid of 4x4 pixels.
  - observation: Input grid has a border of blue (1) pixels.
  - observation: The blue border is not present in the output.
  - observation: Colors in the output grid are present in the input grid, but positions differ
  - observation: Colors other than blue (1) in the corners of the input grid appear in the output grid, maintaining relative corner positions.
  - observation: Input grid colors: red (2), blue (1), white (0), green (3), azure (8), yellow (4), magenta (6)
  - observation: Output grid colors: white (0), red (2), green(3), yellow(4), magenta (6)
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      size: 8x8
      border_color: blue (1)
    has: corner_colors
  - object: corner_colors
      type: array
      properties: [top_left, top_right, bottom_left, bottom_right]
      values: [red(2), green(3), yellow(4), magenta (6)]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      size: 4x4
    has: corner_colors
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the input grid:**  The input is an 8x8 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Identify the border:** Note the blue (1) pixels forming a border around the grid.
3.  **Identify non-blue corner colors:** The top-left is red(2), Top-right is green (3), Bottom-left is yellow (4), bottom-right is magenta(6).
4.  Ignore all colors, except for the corner ones.
5. Create a blank output grid.
6.  **Extract corner colors**: Extract the colors from the four corners of the *inner* 6x6 grid (excluding the blue border). Note the color of each corner and it's original location (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
7.  **Construct the output grid**: Create a 4x4 output grid.
8. Populate the top-left corner using the extracted top-left corner.
9. Populate the top-right corner using the extracted top-right corner.
10. Populate the bottom-left corner using the extracted bottom-left corner.
11. Populate the bottom-right corner using the extracted bottom-right corner.
12. All other output cells are white (0).

Essentially, the program extracts the colors of the four corners within the blue borders of the input and places those colors in the corresponding corners of the output grid. The rest of the output grid defaults to white (0).
