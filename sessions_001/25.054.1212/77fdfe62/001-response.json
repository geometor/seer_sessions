The input grid appears to contain various colored pixels, with a prominent blue border (represented by '1'). The output grid seems to be a condensed version, retaining only certain colors from the input and seemingly ignoring the blue border. The positions and colors in output doesn't have obvious direct mapping based on position in input. It could be a kind of summarization or extraction based on color. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (8x8 input vs. 4x4 output).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Ignore all colors, except for the corner ones.\n5. Create a blank output grid.\n6.  **Extract corner colors**: Extract the colors from the four corners of the *inner* 6x6 grid (excluding the blue border). Note the color of each corner and it's original location (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\n7.  **Construct the output grid**: Create a 4x4 output grid.\n8. Populate the top-left corner using the extracted top-left corner.\n9. Populate the top-right corner using the extracted top-right corner.\n10. Populate the bottom-left corner using the extracted bottom-left corner.\n11. Populate the bottom-right corner using the extracted bottom-right corner.\n12. All other output cells are white (0).\n\nEssentially, the program extracts the colors of the four corners within the blue borders of the input and places those colors in the corresponding corners of the output grid. The rest of the output grid defaults to white (0).\n"
