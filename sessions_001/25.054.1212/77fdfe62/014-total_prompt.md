## Example 3

**input:**
```
6 1 0 0 0 0 1 2
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 0 8 0 8 1 0
0 1 8 8 8 0 1 0
0 1 8 0 8 8 1 0
0 1 8 8 8 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
7 1 0 0 0 0 1 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7BFC47FBA020>

**output:**
```
0 6 0 2
6 6 2 0
7 0 4 4
7 7 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4757A530>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both grids of numbers, representing colors. The input grid is larger (8x8) than the output grid (4x4). There's a noticeable pattern of a blue (1) frame around a central area with azure (8) elements in the input. The colors in the output seem to correspond to some of the corner and edge colors in the input, specifically magenta (6), red (2), orange (7) and yellow(4), plus white(0).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 8x8, output grid is 4x4.
  - object_input: Input grid has a frame of blue (1) pixels.
  - object_input: Inside the frame, there are azure (8) pixels and white (0) pixels.
  - object_input: Corners of outer blue frame have distinct colors, top-left is magenta (6), top-right is red(2), bottom-left is orange(7) and bottom-right is yellow (4).
  - object_output: output grid has a size that matches one quarter of the original
  - object_output: colors are from outside corners, preserving original relative locations.
  - object_output: The center of each quadrant in output has a white(0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Corners:** Locate the four corner pixels of the outermost blue (1) "frame" within the input grid, and identify the colors there.
2.  **Quadrant Mapping:** Divide the input grid conceptually into four equal 4x4 quadrants.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 4x4 output grid.
4. Populate Corners:
    - Output (0,0) : color at the corner of input upper-left quadrant - magenta (6).
    - Output (0,3) : color at the corner of input upper-right quadrant - red (2).
    - Output (3,0) : color at the corner of input lower-left quadrant - orange (7).
    - Output (3,3) : color at the corner of input lower-right quadrant - yellow (4).
5. Copy the colors in these locations to all four spots in each corner in the final output:
    - Output (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) : same color as the input upper-left corner - magenta (6)
    - Output (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3) : same color as the input upper-right corner - red (2)
    - Output (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1) : same color as the input lower-left corner - orange (7)
    - Output(2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3) : same color as the input lower-right corner - yellow (4)
6. Insert Zeroes: fill the remaining spaces with white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
