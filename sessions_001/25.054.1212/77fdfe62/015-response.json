            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the natural language program and the subsequent code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the derived code were too specific to the first training example. The core idea of extracting colors from outside a blue frame is correct, but the assumptions about a 4x4 output and the exact positioning of those colors are incorrect. The errors clearly show out-of-bounds issues, indicating that the output grid size and the logic for determining corner colors need to be more general and adaptable to different input grid sizes and frame positions. The strategy should shift from fixed output size to a dynamic one based on input. The critical error lies in the inaccurate logic for capturing the blue \"frame\" colors. The existing code assumes colors will always be inside the blue frame at an exact offset of 1 pixel. This is where the indexing errors occur.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Dynamic Output Size:** Instead of assuming a 4x4 output, the output grid size should be determined by the dimensions of the blue frame itself. If the frame is 2x2 inside the blue frame, the output should capture that.\n2.  **Robust Frame Detection:**  The `get_frame_corners` function needs to correctly and reliably identify the bounding box of the blue (1) pixels, even if there isn't a complete \"frame\" around all data or other blue colored pixels present.\n3.  **Correct Color Extraction:** The logic for finding the pixels *adjacent* to the frame's corners must be corrected to handle varying distances, handle interior vs exterior adjacency, and be generally more robust.\n4. **Handle different frame shapes.** The current approach assumes a rectangular frame and should be adapted to general frame shapes.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (using hypothetical `code_execution` for detailed analysis - *I will describe the results I would expect to see*)**\n\nI'll describe the kind of analysis I'd perform and the expected insights. I don't have `code_execution` capability, but I can outline the steps and expected outcomes.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Detected Frame Corners: (Hypothetical, assuming corrected logic): (1,1), (1,6), (6,1), (6,6)\n    *   Extracted Corner Colors (Hypothetical, assuming corrected logic): 2, 3, 4, 6\n    *   Output Shape Produced by Code: (4, 4)\n    *   Errors: The index error indicates we are asking for data outside the grid, meaning our corner coordinates are not accurately picking pixels adjacent to the rectangle.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Detected Frame Corners: (Hypothetical): (1,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4)\n    *   Extracted Corner Colors (Hypothetical): 9, 4, 2, 3\n    *   Output Shape Produced by Code: (4, 4) - Incorrect, should be (2, 2)\n    * Errors: The existing approach fails because the output shape is hardcoded to 4x4.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (8, 8)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Detected Frame Corners (Hypothetical): (1,1), (1,6), (6,1), (6,6)\n    *   Extracted Corner Colors (Hypothetical): 6, 2, 7, 4\n    *   Output Shape Produced by Code: (4, 4)\n    *   Errors: The index error indicates we are asking for data outside the grid, meaning our corner coordinates are not accurately picking pixels adjacent to the rectangle.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: blue_frame\n    type: frame\n    color: blue\n    description: Outermost contiguous block of blue (1) pixels.  May not be a complete rectangle.\n    properties:\n      - corners:\n        description: The top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right pixels defining the extent of the blue frame.\n  - object: corner_pixels\n    type: pixels\n    description: Pixels directly adjacent to the corners of the blue frame, *outside* the frame.\n    properties:\n      - colors:\n        description: The colors of these adjacent pixels.  Used to populate the output grid.\n  - object: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    description: The resulting grid after the transformation.\n    properties:\n      - size: dynamic\n        description:  Determined by the dimensions of the detected `blue_frame`.  Specifically, the width and height of the section enclosed by the blue_frame.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find the Blue Frame:** Identify the outermost contiguous block of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. This block defines a \"frame,\" which might not be a perfectly closed rectangle.\n2.  **Determine Frame Boundaries:** Determine the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right coordinates of this blue frame.\n3.  **Extract Adjacent Colors:** Find the colors of the pixels *immediately adjacent* to each of the four corner pixels of the blue frame, *outside* of the blue frame itself. If a corner pixel is at the edge of the entire input grid, and therefore has no \"outside\" adjacent pixel, use color black (0).\n4.  **Determine Output Size:**  Calculate the width and height of the output grid. The width is the difference in x-coordinates between the top-right and top-left corners of the blue frame, minus 1. The height is the difference in y-coordinates between the bottom-left and top-left corners, minus 1.\n5.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the calculated dimensions.\n6.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill the output grid with the extracted corner colors.\n    *   The color of the pixel adjacent to the top-left corner of the blue frame fills the top-left quadrant of the output grid area.\n    *   The color of the pixel adjacent to the top-right corner fills the top-right quadrant.\n    *   The color of the pixel adjacent to the bottom-left corner fills the bottom-left quadrant.\n    *   The color of the pixel adjacent to the bottom-right corner fills the bottom-right quadrant.\n\nThe key improvements here are:\n\n*   **Dynamic Output Size:** The output grid size is now calculated, not assumed.\n*   **\"Adjacent\" Colors:** Emphasizes that we're looking at pixels *next to* the frame corners, and clarified inside vs outside relationship.\n* **Handles partial frames**: Acknowledges the possibility of incomplete rectangular frames.\n* **Clearer Quadrant Mapping**: More specific description to relate the corner pixel to the correct location in the new grid.\n"
