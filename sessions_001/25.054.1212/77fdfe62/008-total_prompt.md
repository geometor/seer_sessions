## Example 2

**input:**
```
9 1 0 0 1 4
1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 8 8 1 0
0 1 8 0 1 0
1 1 1 1 1 1
2 1 0 0 1 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC47FBA020>

**output:**
```
9 4
2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC47579030>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels, and the output is a significantly smaller grid, also of colored pixels. The colors in the output grid appear to be derived from the input grid, specifically from the corners. The size reduction is substantial. The most obvious pattern is that some corner pixels from the input are retained in the output, and other colors within the input grid are discarded.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [6x6] # Input grid dimensions
      elements: pixels
      colors: [maroon, blue, white, yellow, azure, red, green] #input colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [2x2] # Output grid dimensions
      elements: pixels
      colors: [maroon, yellow, red, white] #output colors

actions:
  - type: extract
    description: Select specific pixels from the input grid.
    parameters:
      locations: [top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle-x, bottom-right]

relationships:
  - type: corresponds_to
    description: The output grid's pixels correspond to specific corner pixels of the input grid.
    pairs:
      - [input(0,0), output(0,0)]
      - [input(0,5), output(0,1)]
      - [input(5,0), output(1,0)]
      - [input(5,3), output(1,1)]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Corners:** Observe the input grid and identify the pixels located at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right corners.
2.  **Extract Corner Colors:** extract only these corner pixels.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 2x2 output grid.
4.  **Populate Output:**
    *   Place the color of the top-left input corner pixel in the top-left position of the output grid.
    *   Place the color of the top-right input corner pixel in the top-right position of the output grid.
    *   Place the color of the bottom-left input corner pixel in the bottom-left position of the output grid.
    *.  Place the color of the bottom-middle-x corner pixel (where x is width -3) in the bottom-right position of the output.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the four corner pixels of the input grid and uses them to create a 2x2 output grid, preserving the relative corner positions, except for the right corner.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
