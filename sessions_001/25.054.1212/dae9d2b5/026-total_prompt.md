## Example 5

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 3 0
4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 3 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC4757FDC0>

**output:**
```
0 6 0
6 0 0
6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A950>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels to another grid of colored pixels. The input grid has varying dimensions (6x3 in the example) and contains pixels of colors white (0), yellow (4), and green (3). The output grid appears to be a simplified, smaller version (3x3) of the input, with only white (0) and magenta (6) pixels. The key seems to be identifying and consolidating specific colored regions from the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 6x3
      colors: [0, 3, 4]
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 6]
  - objects:
    - color_blocks:
        description: "Contiguous regions of non-white pixels in the input"
        colors_present: [3, 4]
        
  - actions:
      - consolidate:
          description: "Combines non-white pixel regions. Possibly identify some characteristic and takes the position of it."
      - recolor:
          description: "Changes the color of the consolidated regions to magenta (6)"

  - relationships:
     - input_output_size: "Output grid is a 2x2 downscaled and recentered version, discarding the padding/bordering 0's."
     - color_mapping: "3 and 4 in the input become 6 in the output."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Non-White Regions:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0). In this case find and group all occurrences of colors green (3) and yellow (4).

2. **Downscale and Recenter**: Reduce the grid size down to half the input in x and half the input in y discarding the outer border of 0's.

3. **Consolidate and Recolor:** all non-white colors that are present after downscaling are transformed to 6.

4. **Output:** The result is the 3x3 output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
