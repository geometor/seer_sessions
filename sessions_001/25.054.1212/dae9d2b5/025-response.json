The input grid has varying dimensions (6x3 in the example) and contains pixels of colors white (0), yellow (4), and green (3). The output grid appears to be a simplified, smaller version (3x3) of the input, with only white (0) and magenta (6) pixels. The key seems to be identifying and consolidating specific colored regions from the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
