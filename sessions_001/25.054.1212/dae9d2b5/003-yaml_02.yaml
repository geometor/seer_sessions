observations:
  - task: 002
    facts:
      - type: object_identification
        description: The input and output grids contain colored pixels.
      - type: color_mapping
        description: Green (3) and Yellow (4) pixels in the input are mapped to Magenta (6) in the output. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
      - type: spatial_relationship
        description: The output grid dimensions are determined by the bounding box of non-white pixels in the input grid.
      - type: transformation_rule
        description:  The transformation involves finding the bounding box of non-white pixels, extracting that region, and then applying color substitution.
