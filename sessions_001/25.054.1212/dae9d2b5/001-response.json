The input grid appears to have yellow (4), green (3), and white (0) pixels, while the output grid has magenta (6) and white (0) pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x6). It seems that specific colors in the input grid are mapped to a different color in the output grid, while white remains white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
