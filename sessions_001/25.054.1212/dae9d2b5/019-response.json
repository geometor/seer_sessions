The input grid has dimensions 3x6 (rows x columns), while the output grid has dimensions 3x3. The colors in the input seem to be yellow (4), green (3), and white (0). The output grid contains magenta (6) and white (0). It appears that the non-white colors in the input grid are replaced with magenta in the output grid. The output grid's dimensions are the important thing, it is the left half section.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
