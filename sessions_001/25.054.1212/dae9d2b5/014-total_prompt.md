## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 4 0 3 0
0 4 4 3 0 3
4 4 0 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC4890A200>

**output:**
```
0 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4757FDC0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x6 grid with colored pixels. The colors present are white (0), yellow (4), and green (3).
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid. Most of the output grid is magenta (6), except for a single white (0) pixel in the top-left corner.
*   **Transformation:** The input grid seems to be simplified or reduced into a smaller grid.  The most obvious change is the introduction of magenta (6) which doesn't exist in the input. The presence of a single white pixel suggests some element might be preserved, potentially a representation of the "background."

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid
    dimensions: [3, 6]
    colors: [0, 3, 4]  # white, green, yellow
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    colors: [0, 6] # white, magenta
  - type: object
    description: background
    color: 0 # white
    input_location: all_cells # present in many input cells
    output_location: [0,0] # present in the corner

  - type: transformation
    description: size reduction and color introduction
    input_shape: [3,6]
    output_shape: [3,3]
    introduced_color: 6 #magenta

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of size 3x3. Fill all cells of the output grid with the color magenta (6).

2.  **Background Preservation:** In the top-left cell (0, 0) of the output grid, change the color to white (0). This action can be justified by the dominance of the 0 (white) in the background of the input.

In short: The input grid is replaced with a 3x3 magenta grid, and the background is preserved as white in a single pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
