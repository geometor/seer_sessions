  - output_type: "2D grid"
  - output_size: "3x3"
  - primary_operation: "Rotation and Color Mapping"
  - rotation: "90 degrees clockwise"
  - color_mapping_rule: "Non-white pixels in the rotated input become magenta (6) in the output."
  - spatial_mapping: "The 3x3 output grid corresponds to the top-left 3x3 section of the rotated input."
  - error_type: "Incorrect spatial mapping of rotated pixels."
