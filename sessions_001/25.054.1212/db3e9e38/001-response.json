The input appears to be transformed into a different grid with some changes in color/values based on the position and value of the original pixels. The primary object appears to be a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The transformation seems to involve adding azure pixels (8) around this object, and also adjusting the placement of the orange object slightly upwards.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
