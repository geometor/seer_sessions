## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC47586590>

**output:**
```
8 7 8 7 8 7 8
0 7 8 7 8 7 0
0 0 8 7 8 0 0
0 0 0 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC44367820>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The input appears to be transformed into a different grid with some changes in color/values based on the position and value of the original pixels. The primary object appears to be a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The transformation seems to involve adding azure pixels (8) around this object, and also adjusting the placement of the orange object slightly upwards.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: vertical_line
    color: orange (7)
    position: centered_vertically
    start_row: 0
    end_row: 3
  - action: add_context
    context_color: azure (8)
    shape: frame
    relative_position: surrounding
    target: vertical_line
  - transformation: shift
    direction: up
    magnitude_y: 1
    magnitude_x: 0
    object: vertical_line

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Object:** Locate the vertical line of orange (7) pixels.
2.  **Frame:** Create a single-pixel thick frame of azure (8) around the initial position *before* step 3.
3.  **Shift:** Move the original orange (7) line upwards by one pixel.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
