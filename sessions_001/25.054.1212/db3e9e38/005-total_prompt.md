Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to refine the natural language program and the subsequent code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code (not provided, but implied) clearly doesn't capture the correct transformation. The `calculate_metrics` function is helpful for evaluating the hypothetical `transformed_output` against the `expected_output`.  The metrics reveal significant discrepancies: the sizes are sometimes incorrect, colors don't always match, and the number of pixels of each color is often wrong. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the initial understanding of the transformation rule.  We need to re-examine the input-output pairs, looking for a simpler, more generalizable pattern, and possibly discarding any initial assumptions.

**Strategy:**

1. **Re-examine Examples:**  Carefully inspect the provided input and expected output grids again. Ignore the incorrect `transformed_output` and focus *solely* on the relationship between the `input` and `expected_output`.
2. **Identify Simple Patterns:** Look for basic geometric transformations, color changes, or object manipulations. Start with the simplest possible hypotheses.
3. **Focus on Objectness:** Consider contiguous regions of the same color as potential objects.
4. **Prioritize Size and Color:**  Given the metrics, the size and color palette correctness are primary concerns.  Address these first.
5. **Iterative Refinement:** Formulate a new natural language program, then we'll translate it into code (in the next phase). We'll use `calculate_metrics` to check, and iterate.

**Metrics Reports (using `calculate_metrics` output):**

**Example 1:**

```
Example 1 Metrics: {'match': False, 'pixels_off': 21, 'size_correct': True, 'color_palette_correct': False, 'correct_pixel_counts': False}
```

*   **Match:**  `False` (The transformed output does not match the expected output).
*   **Pixels Off:** 21 (A large number of pixels differ).
*   **Size Correct:** `True` (The dimensions of the transformed output are the same as the expected output).
*   **Color Palette Correct:** `False` (The set of colors used in the transformed output is not the same as in the expected output).
*   **Correct Pixel Counts**: `False` (The counts for matching colors are not correct).

**Example 2:**

```
Example 2 Metrics: {'match': False, 'pixels_off': 33, 'size_correct': True, 'color_palette_correct': False, 'correct_pixel_counts': False}
```

*   **Match:** `False`
*   **Pixels Off:** 33
*   **Size Correct:** `True`
*   **Color Palette Correct:** `False`
*  **Correct Pixel Counts**: `False`

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Example 1 input has a vertical line of orange (7) pixels in the center.
  - observation: |
      Example 1 expected output has an alternating pattern of azure (8) and orange (7) pixels surrounding a central orange (7) pixel, with the pattern extending to the edges.
  - observation: |
      Example 2 input has a vertical line of orange (7) pixels, similar to Example 1, but shifted one column to the left.
  - observation: |
      Example 2 expected output has a similar alternating pattern of azure (8) and orange (7) as Example 1, but the pattern's starting position and extent are adjusted to the new position of the orange line.
  - object:
      name: orange_line
      description: A vertical line of orange (7) pixels.
      properties:
        - color: orange (7)
        - shape: vertical line
  - action:
      name: create_pattern
      description: |
          An alternating pattern of azure (8) and orange (7) is created around the orange_line.
      parameters:
        - pattern: azure (8), orange (7)
        - origin: orange_line
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "seed":** Find the vertical line of orange (color 7) pixels. This is our primary object.
2.  **Create the alternating pattern:** Starting from the "seed" line, extend outwards, alternating between azure (8) and orange (7) pixels.
3.  **Extend to edges:** Continue the alternating pattern until the edges of the grid are reached, both horizontally and vertically. The orange pixels of the seed line are included as part of the alternating sequence. The result uses only the color of the "seed" (orange), and azure.

The key insight here is to view the transformation as building outwards from a central "seed" object, creating a simple alternating pattern. This is a much more likely solution than whatever the previous (unseen) code was attempting.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
