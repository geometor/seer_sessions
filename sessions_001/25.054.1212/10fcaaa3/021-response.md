Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited understanding of the transformation, derived from only the first example. It incorrectly assumed:

1.  **Replication of *all* non-zero pixels:** The initial code was written to specifically find and replicate red pixels, but it's clear from later examples that any non-zero pixel should be replicated (e.g., magenta (6), yellow(4)). It also makes copies +2 in both x and y coordinates from original location, when it should only do a direct replication of the original.
2.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** The initial code applies an azure checkerboard pattern across the *entire* output grid, irrespective of the input. This isn't correct; the checkerboard, if present at all, is more nuanced, and certainly should not overwrite duplicated colored pixels.
3. **Size:** It assumes an expansion to exactly double the original size. The provided examples and outputs appear to generally increase, but the size of output depends on where the replicated colored pixels will reside.
4. **Zeroes:** Zeroes are replaced with 8s (azure) incorrectly.

The strategy for resolving these errors involves:

1.  **Generalizing Pixel Replication:** Instead of targeting only red pixels (2), the code should identify *any* non-zero pixel and replicate it.
2.  **Conditional Azure Placement:** Instead of a blanket checkerboard, the placement of azure pixels needs to be determined based on a more complex rule, likely related to the positions of the original non-zero pixels. The example outputs show that zero-pixels are replaced conditionally.
3. **Size Determination:** The final output dimensions depend on the location of replicated pixels, not merely a doubling of original.
4. **Zero-Pixel Handling:** Understand precisely *when* zero-pixels should become azure, and *when* they should remain white (0).

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a summary of the examples, focusing on the critical differences:

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Non-Zero Input Pixels (Value, Count) | Non-Zero Output Pixels | Notes                                                                                                       |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | (2, 4)      | (4, 8)      | 5 (1)                               | 5(2), 8 (16)       | Gray (5) duplicated, some zeroes to azure (8)                                                               |

| 3       | (5, 3)      | (10, 6)     | 4 (2)                               | 4(4), 8(26)       | Yellow (4) duplicated, some zeroes to azure. One row *between* the yellows expanded by 2.      |
| 4       | (4, 4)       | (8, 8)          | 2 (1)                               | 2(2), 8(24) | Red (2) duplicated, , some zeroes to azure. No rows/cols *between* reds                                                             |

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero value.
2.  **Duplicate Non-Zero Pixels:** For each non-zero pixel, create a duplicate.
    - Determine the row and column indices (r, c) of the non-zero pixels
    - Insert the duplicate pixel in the output grid according to this rule, where (r,c) is original location:
        - `output[r, c + (4 if c > 0 else 3)] = input[r, c]`
3. **Determine Output Grid Size**:
    - output grid height = input grid height * 2
    - output grid width = input grid width * 2
4.  **Fill Zero Pixels Conditionally:** Iterate through all cells of a NEW output grid.
    - if input grid cell is zero, determine if the output grid should be azure (8) or remain white (0) at the respective location in the upscaled grid.
     - if the respective location is even row and even col, OR, odd row and odd col:
       - if there is no non-zero pixel present at the upscaled index in the output grid,
         - set value to azure (8)
       - else
         - set value to white (0)
5.  **Populate Output Grid:**
    - fill output grid with replicated non-zero colors from the input grid

This natural language program provides a significantly improved and generalized description of the transformation, capturing the key aspects observed across all examples. It addresses the pixel replication and the conditional azure filling, while also accounting for size changes.
