Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observing the first training example, which involved duplicating non-zero pixels and filling some zero-valued pixels with azure. However, the subsequent examples reveal inconsistencies and errors:

1.  **Incorrect Duplication Logic:** The duplication logic seems flawed. It places a duplicate of colored pixels based on their original row and column and also shifts non-zero pixels not at column 0 by 2 to the right.
2.  **Out-of-Bounds Errors:** Examples 2 and 3 result in out-of-bounds errors, indicating that the output grid size calculation or pixel placement logic is incorrect for some input grid configurations.
3. **Inconsistent Filling Rule** The output of current code show that the logic to conditionally fill zero pixels with Azure is also not applied consistently with the expected output.
4.  **Size:** The output size seems to double in both dimensions.

The strategy to resolve these issues will involve:

1.  **Correcting the Duplication Rule:** Re-examining the examples to determine the precise rule governing the placement of duplicated non-zero pixels, accounting for rows as well as columns.
2.  **Revising Size Calculation:** Ensuring the output grid dimensions are calculated correctly, preventing out-of-bounds errors. The size should be double the input in both dimensions.
3.  **Clarifying the Azure Filling Rule:** Defining the exact conditions under which zero-valued pixels are replaced with azure (8).

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**
I will not use code execution here. I will create the fact report by visually examining the new images.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Double the Grid:** The input grid is doubled in both dimensions (height and width) to create the output grid.

2.  **Locate non-zero Pixels:** Identify all pixels in the *input grid* with a value other than zero.

3.  **Duplicate Colors:** For each located non-zero pixel from the input grid, its color is duplicated in the output grid:
    * The color is placed into the output grid using an upscaled location, using a simple rule: `out_row = in_row * 2 + 1` and `out_col = in_col * 2 + 1`
    *   If the input column is not the last (rightmost) column, place a second copy of that color at the upscaled location 2 to the right.

4. **Fill with Azure:** Fill every cell in the output grid that is still zero (white) with the color azure (8) if it is located at an `even row, even column` OR `odd row, odd column`. Other zero locations are not changed.
