Most cells are white (0), with two magenta (6) pixels.\n*   **Output:** A 6x8 grid. The magenta (6) pixels from the input are present, but their positions are changed, and a pattern of azure (8) pixels surrounds them. The arrangement of the magenta pixels appears to be mirrored and repeated.\n*\tThe output is created by duplicating the input and adding a reflected copy of the input below a solid line of azure(8) and placing azure between items and to the right of items in the upper part.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
