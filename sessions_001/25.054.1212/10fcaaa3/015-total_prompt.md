Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded. The output grid is double and one more in width, with the input grid being doubled and then one is added. the height of the output is also doubled, then one added.

2. **Copy and Repetition:** the input is duplicated to a width two times the size of the original, and then the output is repeated, two times,

3.  **Border:** A border of 8's appears around the output.

4.  **Fill:** Around each yellow ('4') pixel in the expanded grid, fill the adjacent '0' (white) pixels with '8' (azure) in a checkerboard like pattern. Specifically, change some remaining '0' pixels to '8' to create the pattern seen. The 8's appear to fill in the spots and connect up to the yellow spots.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
