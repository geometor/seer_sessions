            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very limited understanding of the transformation, derived from only the first example. It incorrectly assumed:\n\n1.  **Replication of *all* non-zero pixels:** The initial code was written to specifically find and replicate red pixels, but it's clear from later examples that any non-zero pixel should be replicated (e.g., magenta (6), yellow(4)). It also makes copies +2 in both x and y coordinates from original location, when it should only do a direct replication of the original.\n2.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** The initial code applies an azure checkerboard pattern across the *entire* output grid, irrespective of the input. This isn't correct; the checkerboard, if present at all, is more nuanced, and certainly should not overwrite duplicated colored pixels.\n3. **Size:** It assumes an expansion to exactly double the original size. The provided examples and outputs appear to generally increase, but the size of output depends on where the replicated colored pixels will reside.\n4. **Zeroes:** Zeroes are replaced with 8s (azure) incorrectly.\n\nThe strategy for resolving these errors involves:\n\n1.  **Generalizing Pixel Replication:** Instead of targeting only red pixels (2), the code should identify *any* non-zero pixel and replicate it.\n2.  **Conditional Azure Placement:** Instead of a blanket checkerboard, the placement of azure pixels needs to be determined based on a more complex rule, likely related to the positions of the original non-zero pixels. The example outputs show that zero-pixels are replaced conditionally.\n3. **Size Determination:** The final output dimensions depend on the location of replicated pixels, not merely a doubling of original.\n4. **Zero-Pixel Handling:** Understand precisely *when* zero-pixels should become azure, and *when* they should remain white (0).\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a summary of the examples, focusing on the critical differences:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Non-Zero Input Pixels (Value, Count) | Non-Zero Output Pixels | Notes                                                                                                       |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | (2, 4)      | (4, 8)      | 5 (1)                               | 5(2), 8 (16)       | Gray (5) duplicated, some zeroes to azure (8)                                                               |\n| 2       | (3, 4)      | (6, 8)      | 6 (2)                               | 6(4), 8(28)                                                                                | Magenta (6) duplicated, some zeroes to azure (8)                                                            |\n| 3       | (5, 3)      | (10, 6)     | 4 (2)                               | 4(4), 8(26)       | Yellow (4) duplicated, some zeroes to azure.

It addresses the pixel replication and the conditional azure filling, while also accounting for size changes.\n"
