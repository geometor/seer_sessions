transformations:
  - step: 1
    description: "Double the size of the input grid, creating an output grid with twice the height and width."
  - step: 2
    description: "Copy all colored pixels (not black or white) from input to output at the corresponding location and to mirrored location at right"
  - step: 3
    description: "Add azure lines to the immediate left and right side of all colored pixels on the first half"
  - step: 4
    description: "Draw a horizontal line of azure pixels at the middle row, separating the top and bottom halves."
  - step: 5
    description: "Mirror the top half of the output grid (excluding the middle azure line) to the bottom half. "
