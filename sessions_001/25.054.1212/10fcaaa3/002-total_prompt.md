## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x128 at 0x7BFC47F93C70>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x256 at 0x7BFC48A63190>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 2D grid. The input grid seems to be smaller than the output grid, suggesting some form of expansion or replication. The colors in the grids include 0 (white), 5 (gray) and the output introduces 8 (azure). The presence of 5 (gray) in the input is maintained in the output, but its positioning/pattern changes. A distinct pattern of alternating columns of 0s (whites) and other colors is introduced in the output that did not exist in the original.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: [2, 4]
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
      - value: 5
        color: gray
        positions: [[1, 1]]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: [4, 8]
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 5], [0, 7], [1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6], [2, 1], [2, 3], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 0], [3, 2], [3, 4], [3, 6]]
      - value: 5
        color: gray
        positions:  [[1, 1], [1, 5], [3, 1], [3, 5]]
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        positions: [[0, 0], [0, 2], [0, 4], [0, 6], [2, 0], [2, 2], [2, 4], [2, 6]]
  - observation: output_width: input_width * 2
  - observation: output_height: input_height * 2
  - observation: gray_positions: "Gray pixels in the output are present at every other row, offset horizontally by multiples of four columns, appearing in the same row in the input and the row below."
  - observation: azure_columns: "Azure appears in columns where x is even"
  - observation: white_columns: "White appears in all columns where x is odd"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Expand Grid:** Double the width and height of the input grid.
2. **Populate Azure:** For every even column index (starting from 0) of the expanded grid, fill all cells in that column with the color azure (8).
3. **Populate Gray:** For each gray (5) pixel in the original input grid, place a gray pixel in the output grid at the corresponding, scaled position: (`input_row` * 2 + 1, `input_col` * 2 + 1).
4. **Populate Gray, Shifted** Duplicate the gray pixels placed down one row (`input_row` * 2 + 1, `input_col` * 2+1)
5. **Fill Remaining:** Fill all remaining empty cells in the output grid with white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
