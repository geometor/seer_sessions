The input grid seems to be smaller than the output grid, suggesting some form of expansion or replication. The colors in the grids include 0 (white), 5 (gray) and the output introduces 8 (azure). The presence of 5 (gray) in the input is maintained in the output, but its positioning/pattern changes. A distinct pattern of alternating columns of 0s (whites) and other colors is introduced in the output that did not exist in the original.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
