## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 6 0
0 0 0 0
0 6 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7BFC4890A3B0>

**output:**
```
0 0 6 0 0 0 6 0
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 6 0 8 0 6 0 8
8 0 6 0 8 0 6 0
8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8
0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7BFC48908D00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x4 grid. Most cells are white (0), with two magenta (6) pixels.
*   **Output:** A 6x8 grid. The magenta (6) pixels from the input are present, but their positions are changed, and a pattern of azure (8) pixels surrounds them. The arrangement of the magenta pixels appears to be mirrored and repeated.
*	The output is created by duplicating the input and adding a reflected copy of the input below a solid line of azure(8) and placing azure between items and to the right of items in the upper part.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid
    dimensions: 3x4
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        count: 10
      - color: magenta
        value: 6
        count: 2

  - type: grid
    description: Output grid
    dimensions: 6x8
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        count: 20
      - color: magenta
        value: 6
        count: 8
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        count: 20
  - observation:
      description: Magenta pixels are retained, positions altered, and surrounded by azure.
  - observation:
      description: Apparent mirroring and expansion of the input pattern in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy and Expand:** Create a new grid which doubles the height and width from the input grid to new grid.

2.  **Duplicate Magenta:** Copy all the magenta element in the original grid locations in the new grid, then duplicate the magenta pixels at a mirrored location at the right side.

3.  **Mirror Magenta:** Duplicate the expanded top grid, below a solid line of azure.

4.  **Fill Azure:** Add a complete line of azure below the created top grid.

5. **Fill Azure:** Fill with azure the columns between the two first and between the next two columns in the original grid.

6.  **Fill Azure:** Fill the created structure with azure where ever required.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
