However, the logic for filling the connecting spaces with '8' (azure) is flawed and inconsistent. It seems to be based on a simple adjacency check, but it doesn't correctly identify the intended connecting pattern in all cases. The strategy should be:\n\n1.  **Maintain the 2x2 Duplication:** This part is working correctly, creating a grid twice the size of the input and copying the input to all four quadrants.\n2.  **Refine the Filling Logic:** Instead of a simple adjacency check, we need a more robust rule to determine where to place the '8's. The '8's should fill any empty cell that is *adjacent* to any copied object in the input. It is filling in a checkerboard style.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including some additional metrics calculations using python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)\n    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)\n\n    input_objects = {}\n    \n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            pixel = input_grid[r,c]\n            if pixel != 0:\n                if pixel not in input_objects:\n                    input_objects[pixel] = []\n                input_objects[pixel].append((r,c))\n    \n    \n    # Check for differences between expected and transformed\n    differences = np.where(expected_output != transformed_output)\n    difference_coordinates = list(zip(differences[0], differences[1]))\n    num_differences = len(difference_coordinates)\n\n    print(f\"  -

This creates a 2x2 repetition of the input pattern.\n3.  **Connect:** Iterate through all the empty cells (value 0) in the *output grid*. If an empty cell is horizontally or vertically adjacent to *any* non-zero pixel that originated from the input grid (i.e., it's part of the duplicated pattern), fill that empty cell with the value 8 (azure).\n\nThis refined natural language program provides a complete and more accurate description of the transformation. It addresses the weakness of the previous program's filling logic by explicitly stating the condition for filling with '8' based on the adjacency to the original input objects (within the duplicated areas).\n"
