The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid through a spatial manipulation, specifically a reflection or rotation. The colors themselves remain unchanged; only their positions within the grid are altered. The dimensions of the grid (5x5) are preserved.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
