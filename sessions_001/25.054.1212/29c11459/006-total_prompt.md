## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x320 at 0x7BFC443EE9E0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
3 3 3 3 3 5 7 7 7 7 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numbers (representing colors). The input grid contains a row with two distinct non-zero values (3 and 7, representing green and orange respectively) at opposite ends, with zeros in between. The output grid transforms this row. The non-zero values in the input are expanded towards the center in the output. A new value of 5 (grey) appears in the middle, separating the two expanded original colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x11 (rows x columns)
      cell_values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: color_block
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      start_position: (3, 0) # row, column
      end_position: null

  - type: color_block
    properties:
      color: orange (7)
      start_position: (3, 10)
      end_position: null

  - type: color_block
    properties:
        color: gray (5)
        start_position: null
        end_position: null

actions:
  - type: expand
    object: green color_block
    direction: right
    extent: "until midway - 1"

  - type: expand
    object: orange color_block
    direction: left
    extent: "until midway"
  
  - type: insert
    object: gray (5)
    location: middle cell between color blocks

relationships:
  - spatial: green and orange blocks are on the same row, separated by zeros.
  - transformation: input row transforms into a filled row with expanded colors and a central separator.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the two non-zero values in the input grid's row containing non-zero values. Note their colors and positions.
2.  **Calculate** the midpoint index of this row.
3.  **Expand** the left-most non-zero value (3, green) to the right, filling cells with its value until one cell before the midpoint.
4. **Expand** the right-most non-zero value (7, orange) to the left, filling cell with its value up to and potentially including the calculated midpoint.
5. **Determine** the midpoint. If the number of columns is odd, then there is a true single midpoint. If it is even, use floor((left+right)/2)
6.  **Insert** the value 5 (gray) into the cell at the midpoint position determined in the previous step.

This program covers the expansion of the original colors and the insertion of the central gray color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
