            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the derived code were too specific to the first training example. It correctly identified the core concept of connecting two differently colored pixels on the same row with a line, including a special color (grey) at the center. However, it failed to generalize to other colors and other examples. The second example clearly shows this: it didn't connect the green (3) and orange (7) pixels as expected. The strategy, therefore, must be to generalize the color selection and broaden the rule to apply to *any* two distinct, non-black, non-white colors on a single row. It appears white (0) is a background value.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Broaden Color Selection:** Modify the program/code to identify *any* two distinct colors on a target row, not just blue and red.\n2.  **Maintain Core Logic:** Keep the logic of finding the leftmost and rightmost of these two colors, connecting them, and placing a gray pixel in the center.\n3. Use reports to determine if assumptions of row length and placement are correct.\n\n**Metrics and Reports:**\n\nI will use the provided match and pixels_off in my report.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Match: True\n    *   Pixels Off: 0\n    *   Notes: The initial program worked perfectly for this specific case.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Pixels Off: 9\n    *   Notes: The program failed because it was hardcoded for blue and red. It did not perform the connection operation.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 002\n    example_set: train\n    facts:\n      - type: object_identification\n        description: \"Each example contains a grid of pixels with different colors.\"\n        grid_size: [11, 5]\n        elements:\n          - description: \"In the first example there exist one blue pixel and one red pixel.

Find a row that contains at least two pixels of different colors, excluding black(0).\n2.  **Locate Distinct-Colored Pixels:** On the identified row, find the two distinct-colored pixels that are furthest apart (i.e., the leftmost and rightmost of different colors on that row).\n3. **Determine center column:** The center column will the x value of `(grid_width - 1) / 2`\n4.  **Connect Left to Center:**  Change all pixels between the leftmost pixel and the center column (exclusive) to the color of the leftmost pixel.\n5.  **Connect Center to Right:** Change all pixels between the center column (exclusive) and the rightmost pixel to the color of the rightmost pixel.\n6.  **Place Gray Pixel:** Place a gray (5) pixel at the center column of the target row.\n7. **Output:** Return the changed grid\n"
