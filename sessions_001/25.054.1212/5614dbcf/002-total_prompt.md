## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 0 0 0 8 8 8
3 3 3 0 0 0 8 5 8
3 3 3 0 0 0 8 8 8
0 0 0 7 5 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0
6 6 6 0 0 5 9 9 9
6 6 6 0 0 0 9 9 9
6 5 6 0 5 0 9 9 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC4757DCF0>

**output:**
```
3 0 8
0 7 0
6 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A63190>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (9x9) composed of colored squares. The output is a smaller grid (3x3) composed of colored squares. The colors in the output grid seem to correspond to colors in the input grid. There appear to be distinct colored regions or "objects" in the input. The output seems to be a simplified or abstracted version of the input, focusing on certain key elements or regions. It is reducing 9x9 to 3x3 which suggests a reduction by a factor of 3 in each direction.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - contains: colored_regions
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - contains: single_color_pixels
  - type: colored_region
    properties:
      - shape: rectangular (mostly)
      - colors: [green, blue, azure, orange, white, magenta, maroon, gray]
      - size: varies
      - position: (row, column) within input_grid

actions:
  - type: reduction
    agent: unknown (inferred)
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    method: extraction of representative pixels

relationships:
  - output_grid: simplified_representation_of: input_grid
  - colored_region: part_of: input_grid
  - output_pixel: corresponds_to: input_region (3x3 subgrid)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input 9x9 grid into 9 non-overlapping 3x3 subgrids.
2.  **Identify:** For each 3x3 subgrid in the input, identify the color of the top-left pixel. If there isn't an object at the top-left pixel, check the next pixel in the subgrid skipping any that are white (0).
3.  **Construct:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
4.  **Populate:** For each corresponding position in the output grid (row, column), place the color identified in step 2 for the corresponding 3x3 subgrid in the input.

Essentially, the program is taking the top-left pixel's color of each 3x3 sub-area in the input grid and using it to construct the corresponding cell in the output grid. The output grid is a 3x3 "summary" of the 9x9 input, representing each 3x3 block by a single, characteristic color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
