## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0
0 5 0 2 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 7 7 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 7 5 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7BFC47F93880>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
0 0 0
0 7 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A0E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain single-digit integers representing different colors. The input grid appears to have multiple colored regions, while the output grid seems to be a highly simplified representation, possibly focusing on specific colors or shapes from the input. There seems to be a reduction or summarization process occurring. The reduction in size is significant. The relative positions are maintained.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 9x9
        elements: integers (0-9)
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 3x3
        elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: color_region
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
        shape: rectangle
        input_location: top-center
        output_location: top-center
      - color: orange (7)
        shape: rectangle
        input_location: bottom-center
        output_location: bottom-center
      - color: gray (5)
        shape: scattered
        input_location: various
        output_location: none
      - color: white (0)
        shape: background
        input_location: fills_remainder
        output_location: fills_remainder

actions:
  - type: reduction
    description: The input grid is significantly reduced in size to create the output grid.
  - type: selection
    description: Specific color regions in the input are chosen, and their central color is placed in the output maintaining relative position.
  - type: omission
      description: other colors in the input are omitted.

relationships:
  - input_grid_contains: color_regions
  - output_grid_represents: simplified_input_grid
  - color_regions_position: relatively_maintained_in_output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Regions:** Examine the input grid and identify the centrally located colored regions of interest. In this case 3x3 blocks of red (2) and orange (7) are identified.
2.  **Reduce Dimensions:** Create a smaller output grid (3x3).
3.  **Map Colors:** For each identified key region, take its central color and place it at the equivalent relative position in the output grid.
4.  **Fill Remainder:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with the background color (0, white). The grey (5) pixels are not represented at all in the output.

Essentially, the program extracts the central color of significant colored regions from the input, preserving relative position, and places them into a smaller grid, omitting some objects entirely.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
