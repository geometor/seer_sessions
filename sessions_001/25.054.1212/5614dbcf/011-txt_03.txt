    *   **Transformed Output:**
        ```
        3 0 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 0
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** The code correctly identified the '3' region, but failed to grab the 8,7,6 and 9. It seems the placement of the regions are wrong.

    *   **Expected Output:**
        ```
        0 2 0
        0 0 0
        0 7 0
        ```
    *   **Transformed Output:**
        ```
        0 2 0
        0 0 0
        0 0 0
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** The code correctly identified the '2' region. It seems the issue is that the "7" region is being ignored. The position logic has also failed.
