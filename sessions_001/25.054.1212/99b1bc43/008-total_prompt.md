## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 0 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 1
0 1 1 0
4 4 4 4
0 2 2 2
2 0 2 0
2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC47F93640>

**output:**
```
3 0 3 3
0 0 0 0
0 0 3 0
3 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC47F93880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain distinct sections of different colors (blue, white, yellow, red). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, with a single color (green) highlighting certain cells and the rest being white. The spatial relationship between the colored sections in the input seems to be somehow encoded in the positions of the green cells in the output. Specifically the output seems to be a quarter section on the original grid, and taking only non zero, non-white values that form corners.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is larger than the output grid.
  - dimensions:
      input: 9x4
      output: 4x4
  - input_colors:
      - blue (1)
      - white (0)
      - yellow (4)
      - red (2)
  - output_colors:
      - green (3)
      - white (0)
  - object_input: Input grid is divided into colored regions.
  - object_output: output is likely showing corners of the colored regions, where the corner color is not white
  - spatial_relationship: Output grid corresponds to a condensed, possibly structurally-representative version of the input.
  - action: derive the output from corners of colored sections
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into distinct regions based on contiguous blocks of the same color.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Size**: Create output grid of size 4x4.
3.  **Map Input to Output**: Working at quarter divisions, the input has an upper left and upper right section as well as a lower left and lower right section.
4.  **Populate Output**: For any coordinate in the output, if the corresponding quadrant section in input has a corner value, represent that value, otherwise use 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
