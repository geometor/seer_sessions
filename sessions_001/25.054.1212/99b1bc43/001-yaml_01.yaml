    description: The input grid is divided into subgrids, which are then represented by a single cell in the output grid.
    parameters:
        - name: subgrid_height
          value: 2

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a spatially compressed representation of the input grid. input rows are reduced by about half
