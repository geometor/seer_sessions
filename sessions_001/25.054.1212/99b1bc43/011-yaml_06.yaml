  - type: object
    description: Input grid, varying dimensions.
    properties:
      - contains_pixels: True
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4] # All observed colors
      - shape: 2D array

  - type: object
    description: Output grid, fixed 4x4 dimensions.
    properties:
      - contains_pixels: True
      - colors: [0, 3]  # Output only uses 0 and 3
      - shape: 2D array (4x4)

  - type: process
    description: Quadrant division.  Input grid is divided into four quadrants.
    properties:
        - method:  rows and columns are divided by two.
        - result: Four sub-grids (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

  - type: process
    description: Output generation.  Output 2x2 quadrants filled based on input.
    properties:
        - condition: Presence and arrangement of non-zero pixels in input quadrants.
        - action:  Set corresponding output quadrant pixels to 3 (green) or 0 (white).

  - type: relation
    description: "The output grid represents the presence of non-zero colors for each quadrant of the input grid"
