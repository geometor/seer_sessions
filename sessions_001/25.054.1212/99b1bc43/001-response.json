The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid seems to be a simplified or summarized version of the input.  The colors in the input don't seem to directly map to the output, but there is some kind of spatial relationship. It looks like blocks of the input collapse into single cells.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
