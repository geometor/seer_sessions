observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    shape: (9, 4)
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    notes: Represents the initial state.

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    shape: (4, 4)
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    notes: Represents the transformed state.

  - object: row_sections
    type: list
    elements: 2D arrays
    notes: Input grid is conceptually divided into 2-row sections, plus a single row(row5) section, plus two 2-row section.
  - action: check_color_uniformity
    description: Examines color composition within the 2-row input_grid, and output row sections.
    outcomes:
        - if all pixels within a row are the same, including when they are all zero.
        - if there is a mixture of non-zero colors
        - if an entire sub-grid is a mixture of zeros and ones.
  - action: set output rows:
    description: setting the output row with either white, green or another color
