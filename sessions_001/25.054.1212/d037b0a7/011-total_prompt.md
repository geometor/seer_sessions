Previous Code:
```python
"""
If a pixel is white (0), and the pixel directly *above* it has a different, non-zero color, then set the current pixel's color to the color of the pixel above it.
After applying the above rule to all cells, examine each pixel in the grid, row by row, and left to right.
If a pixel is not white, and the pixel to it's right is a `0` (white), set all `0` pixels to it's right to match the pixel's color until you encounter a non-white pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
