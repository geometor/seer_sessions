## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 9 9 8 9 0 9
9 0 0 8 9 0 0
9 9 9 8 9 9 9
0 9 0 8 0 0 0
9 0 0 8 9 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC44219930>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
8 0 8
0 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7BFC4421A110>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) to another, smaller 2D grid. The colors present in this specific example are white (0), maroon (9), and azure (8). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on the azure (8) pixels. The output is significantly smaller.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x7
      - elements: [0, 9, 8] # Numerical representation of colors
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x3
      - elements: [0, 8]
  - relationship: output_grid_is_derived_from: input_grid
  - observation: input_grid_contains_vertical_line_of_8:
      column: 4
  - observation: output_grid_contains_8_at_intersections_with_input_8s: true

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Feature:** Locate the vertical line of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. In this case, it's in the 4th column.
2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** create an empty output with the same number of rows as the input
    grid, and three columns
3.  **Transfer:** Copy the column containing the azure (8) pixels.
4.  copy to the left and right adjacent columns of the output pixels that are azure(8)
in the copied column.
5. all other cells are 0

In essence, the program extracts a 3x5 section of the input grid, centered on the vertical line of 8's in the middle. The output grid is a new grid, and it has values copied from the original. The azure pixels in the central line of the input and their intersecting horizontal neighbors of azure are extracted, and any blanks or other colors are turned to white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
