1.  **Find the Central Column:** Scan the input grid to find a column where *all* pixels are azure (8). This is the "central column." If no such column is found, return an all white grid that matches the dimensions of the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and 3 columns. Fill this new grid with white (0) pixels.
3.  **Copy Central Column:** If the central column was found, copy the entire central column from the input grid to the second (middle) column of the output grid.
4.  **Copy Adjacent Azure Pixels:** Iterate through all rows of the input grid:
      *   If the found "central column" is not at index 0, check the pixel to the *left* of the central column in the input grid. If it's azure (8), copy it to the corresponding position in the *first* column of the output grid.
      *    If the found "central column" is not at the last index, check the pixel to the *right* of the central column in the input grid. If it's azure (8), copy it to the corresponding position in the *third* column of the output grid.
5. **Return Output Grid** return the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
