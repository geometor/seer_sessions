## Example 5

**input:**
```
0 9 9 8 9 0 9
9 0 9 8 9 9 9
9 9 9 8 0 0 9
9 0 0 8 9 0 0
9 9 9 8 0 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC4890A3B0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7BFC48908D00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x5 grid (width x height) and the output is a 3x5 grid. The primary colors involved seem to be maroon (9), white(0), and azure (8). The azure (8) pixels appear to be the most significant, acting as a kind of marker or selector. The output grid seems to be a cropped and filtered version of the input, retaining only certain elements based on the position of the azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 7x5
    elements:
      - color: maroon (9)
        role: background
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
      - color: azure (8)
        role: selector
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x5
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: azure (8)
  - action: cropping
    description: Reducing the input grid's width and height.
  - action: selection
    description:  Selecting only the azure (8) pixels and all white (0) and preserving their relative positions.

  - relationship:
      subject: azure (8) column
      relation: defines
      object:  output columns containing the azure pixel and a horizontal offset of -1

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Selector Column:** Find the column in the input grid that contains the azure (8) pixels. This is the fourth column from the left (index 3, zero based).

2.  **Determine Output Columns:** Include the selector column as the second column of the output, and select one row from the immediate left of the selected column.

3.  **Crop Input:** Consider a sub-grid from the input, which start at the second row and ends at the second to last row.

4.  **Filter Pixels:** Within the cropped grid, keep all cells which are colored in white (0), and copy only the azure(8) pixels from selected columns.
5. Copy this subgrid into the output grid.

In essence, the transformation isolates and extracts the azure column, takes a column that is horizontal offset of -1 relative to the azure column, then copies into a smaller grid the white and azure pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
