## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
0 0 9 1 9 9 0
9 0 9 1 9 9 0
0 0 0 1 9 0 0
0 9 9 1 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC441A0B50>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7BFC441A0F10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of different dimensions. The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grid seems to contain a vertical line of blue (1) pixels surrounded by other colors. The output grid is smaller and appears to extract a portion of the input, replacing the blue with azure.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: 5x7
        output: 5x3
      elements: pixels
      colors:
        input: [0, 9, 1]
        output: [0, 8]

  - type: line
    properties:
      orientation: vertical
      color:
        input: 1 (blue)
        output: 8 (azure)
      position:
        input: column 4
        output: columns 2&3

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A section of the input grid is extracted.
  - type: color_substitution
    description: Blue (1) is replaced with azure (8).
  - type: size_reduction
    description: change grid dimensions

relationships:
  - input_grid contains vertical_line
  - output_grid is_a_subset_of input_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** a 5x3 section of the input grid. The section contains only white and the two azure cells.
3.  **Locate** where the vertical blue line would be, at the center.
4.  **Substitute**: Create two azure cells side by side where the center of the blue vertical line was.
5. **Return** the final 5x3 grid


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
