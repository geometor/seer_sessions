Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Find the column index where every cell is blue (value 1).
2.  **Checkerboard Prep:** Create an output array with dimensions based on the input height and output width of three, and initialize all elements to 0 (white).
3.  **Recolor:** For all elements detected in step one, change their value to 8 (azure).
4.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** Apply a checkerboard to output. If the row is even, output an azure pixel in column three. If the row is odd, output an azure pixel in the first column.
5.  **Output:** Return the modified 3-column wide output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
