            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying a vertical blue line and recoloring it to azure is partially correct. However, the code fails to accurately position the azure pixels in the output grid according to the expected results. The output consistently places an azure line in the center column, regardless of the input's structure. The expected outputs show a more complex pattern where azure pixels appear to be \"shifting\" based on the input. The code also gets the colors incorrect. The expected result has azure pixels alternating in a checkerboard pattern, and not always in the center.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current program only looks for a single vertical blue line. We need a more general way to identify the relevant blue pixels, considering they might not always form a perfect line.\n2.  **Understand the Shifting Pattern:** The key is to decipher the rule governing how the blue pixels in the input map to the azure pixels in the output. This seems to be a position, or index based rule.\n3.  **Checkerboard:** understand and implement the alternating color output.\n4. **Output size:** get the correct output width.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on discrepancies and potential clues:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Blue line at column 3.\n    *   Expected: Azure at (3,1), (5, 1)\n    *   Actual: Azure in the center column, all rows.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Blue line at column 3.\n    *    Expected: Azure at (3,1), (5,1)\n    *   Actual: Azure in the center column, all rows.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Blue line at column 3.\n    *   Expected: Azure at (0,2), (1, 0), (2, 2).\n    *   Actual: Azure in the center column, all rows.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: Blue line at column 3.\n    *   Expected: Azure in checkerboard, starting at(1, 1)\n    *   Actual: Azure at center column\n*    **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: Blue line at column 3\n    *    Expected: Azure at(1,3)\n    *   Actual: Azure at center column\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 014\n  - input_objects:\n    - description: Vertical blue lines or columns of blue pixels.\n      properties:\n        color: blue (1)\n        shape: vertical line/column\n  - output_objects:\n    - description: Azure pixels in a specific arrangement.\n      properties:\n        color: azure (8)\n        shape: Scattered, potentially forming a shifted, compressed or checkerboard version of the input line.\n  - transformation_rules:\n      - find the vertical blue line\n      - determine transformation to checkerboard\n      - resize to 3 width\n      - recolor the blue to azure\n      - output is checkerboard pattern\n      - other cells are filled with white\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify:** Find the column index where every cell is blue (value 1).\n2. **Checkerboard Prep:** Create an output array with dimensions based on the input\n    height and output with of three, and initialize all elements to 0 (white).\n3. **Recolor:** For all elements detected in step one, change their value to 8\n    (azure).\n4. **Checkerboard Pattern:** Apply a checkerboard to output. If the row is\n    even, output an azure pixel in column three. If the row is odd, output an\n    azure pixel in the first column.\n5.  **Output:** Return the modified 3-column wide output grid.\n"
