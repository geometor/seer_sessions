            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While they correctly identified the azure column and attempted to include the column to its left, they failed in several key aspects:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Width:** The output consistently has only two columns (the azure column and the one to its left), regardless of the input.\n2.  **Incorrect Height:** The code crops the output grid, but not as expected in some cases.\n3.  **Incorrect Copying:** The code is filtering down the output grid to just the white and azure, and filling empty cells in the output with the background color.\n4. **Missing Column to Right**: The expected output includes the column of pixels to the *right* of the azure column.\n\nThe core problem is that the initial program was based on an oversimplified interpretation of the *first* example and didn't generalize well to the others. It needs to copy the azure column along with its right-adjacent column.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* provided examples to identify the *precise* rule governing column selection, row selection (cropping), and pixel copying, paying attention to edge cases (like the azure column being on the far left or right).\n2.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the *complete* set of rules.\n3. **Adjust Code**: Modify the python code to select both the left-adjacent column *and* the right-adjacent column to the azure colored one.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each example, focusing on what the current code *does* versus what it *should* do:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Azure Column: 3\n    *   Expected Columns: 2,3,4\n    *   Notes: Incorrect shape. Incorrect column and row copying.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Azure Column: 3\n    *    Expected Columns: 2,3,4\n    *   Notes: Incorrect shape. Incorrect column and row copying.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Azure Column: 3\n    *   Expected Columns: 2,3,4\n    *   Notes: Incorrect shape. Incorrect column and row copying.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Azure Column: 3\n    *   Expected Columns: 2,3,4\n    *   Notes: Incorrect shape. Incorrect column and row copying.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Azure Column: 3\n    *   Expected Columns: 2,3,4\n    *   Notes: Incorrect shape. Incorrect column and row copying.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      rows: variable\n      columns: variable\n      colors: [0-9]\n  - object: azure_column\n    type: column\n    properties:\n      color: 8\n      index: variable\n      left_adjacent_exists: true/false # Dependant on position\n      right_adjacent_exists: true/false # Dependant on position\n\n  - object: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n       rows: same as input_grid rows\n       columns: 3 # Always three, left adjacent, azure, and right adjacent\n       colors: derived from input_grid columns\n\n  - action: find_azure_column\n    description: Locates the column index containing azure (8) pixels.\n\n  - action: copy_columns\n    description: Copies columns including those adjacent to the azure column to the output grid.\n\n  - action: copy_all_rows\n    description: The entire height of the input columns are copied to the output grid.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Azure:** Locate the column in the input grid that contains azure (color 8) pixels. Note its index.\n2.  **Select Columns:** Select three columns from the input grid:\n    *   The column immediately to the *left* of the azure column (if it exists). If the azure column is the first column, do not include a left-adjacent column.\n    *   The azure column itself.\n    *   The column immediately to the *right* of the azure column (if it exists). If the azure column is the last column, do not include a right-adjacent column.\n3. **Create Output:** Create an output grid with a number of rows the same as the input, and three columns wide\n4.  **Copy Pixels:** Copy all the pixels from the selected columns to the new grid in the same order as they are selected.\n\nThis revised natural language program now captures all observed transformations in the training examples.\n"
