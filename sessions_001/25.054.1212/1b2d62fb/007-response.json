The input grid contains a vertical blue stripe (color 1) and a significant amount of maroon (color 9), and white (color 0). The output grid seems to be a condensed version, primarily white, with a couple of azure pixels (color 8). The positions of the non-white pixels in the output seem to relate to the position of the blue stripe in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In this example, it's column 3 (starting the count from 0).\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same number of rows as the input grid, but with only 3 columns.\n3.  **Populate First Column:** Fill the entire first column of the output grid with white (color 0).\n4.  **Populate Second Column:** Create a new column by taking, at index = (blue strip index // 2) of original grid. Fill this column's content with color azure (8) at the row index where blue appears, 0 otherwise\n5.  **Populate Third Column**: Create a new column by taking, at index = (blue strip index // 2) of original grid. Fill this column's content with color azure (8) at the row index where blue appears, 0 otherwise.\n6.  The output has width of 3, with two colored '8' next to each other in the top row. And all others are 0.\n\nIn simpler terms, a column to the left, in the middle, and to the right of the dividing line (blue stripe index // 2) are taken, and the value is converted to '8' where '1' appears in the input, 0 otherwise.\n"
