The transformation rule is to extract a 3xN subgrid centered on the vertical line of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. The output grid has the same number of rows as the input grid and 3 columns. The central column of the output is a copy of the column containing the vertical line of 8's. The other cells of the output are white (0), unless a row contains azure in both the original central azure column and an azure cell to its immediate left or right.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code correctly identified the core concept: finding a vertical line of azure (8) pixels and using it as the central column of a 3xN output grid. However, the logic for copying adjacent azure pixels is flawed. The current implementation *only* copies an azure pixel if it's both adjacent to the central azure column *and* in a row that *already* contains an azure pixel in the central column. This is too restrictive and doesn't account for cases where azure pixels exist next to the central line but on rows that do not have azure in the line. The expected outputs clearly show that any azure pixel horizontally adjacent to the central line (regardless of the central column's value in that row) should be copied.

The main issue is the misinterpretation of the relationship between the central column of 8s and the adjacent 8s.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine the adjacency check:** Modify the natural language program and subsequently the code to copy *any* azure pixel that is directly to the left or right of the identified central column, regardless of the central column's value for the row.
2.  **Metrics:** Reiterate the need for a full height vertical line of color 8.

**Metrics Gathering (using manual analysis, since code execution isn't available in this turn):**

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Central Column:** Scan the input grid to find a column where *all* pixels are azure (8). This is the "central column." If no such column is found, return an all white grid that matches the dimensions of the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same number of rows as the input grid and 3 columns. Fill this new grid with white (0) pixels.
3.  **Copy Central Column:** If the central column was found, copy the entire central column from the input grid to the second (middle) column of the output grid.
4.  **Copy Adjacent Azure Pixels:** Iterate through all rows of the input grid:
      *   If the found "central column" is not at index 0, check the pixel to the *left* of the central column in the input grid. If it's azure (8), copy it to the corresponding position in the *first* column of the output grid.
      *    If the found "central column" is not at the last index, check the pixel to the *right* of the central column in the input grid. If it's azure (8), copy it to the corresponding position in the *third* column of the output grid.
5. **Return Output Grid** return the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
