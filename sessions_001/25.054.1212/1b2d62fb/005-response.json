            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and strategy.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy, based on the first example, was too simplistic. It correctly identified the vertical blue line as a key reference point and the importance of azure pixels. However, it failed to accurately capture the relationship between *all* rows in the input and how they translate to the output. The core issue is that the code isn't correctly handling rows *without* azure pixels, it puts azure in non-azure rows when the blue line is found. It's also always producing an output grid with the same height of the input - this is incorrect.\n\nThe strategy needs to shift from focusing *solely* on azure rows to considering *all* input rows and their relationship to the blue line and presence/absence of azure.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nI will use a table to summarize the key metrics. Since I do not have code execution capability I have to make some inferences.\n\n| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Blue Line Exists | Blue Line Col | Azure Rows | All Rows Have Azure | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                      |\n|---------|------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | 5x7        | 5x3         | True            | 3             | []         | False            | 8          |  Only row 4 has no azure, so gets an 8. All others are blank                |\n| 2       | 5x7        | 5x3         | True            | 3             | []        | False          | 8          | Only row 1 has no azure                                       |\n| 3       | 5x7        | 5x3         | True            | 3             | []          | False            | 8          | Mixed azure placements.                                                |\n| 4       | 5x7        | 5x3         | True            | 3             | []          | False             | 6          |  Mixed azure placements                                          |\n| 5       | 5x7        | 5x3         | True            | 3             | []         | False        | 8            |   Only row 4 has no azure.                                        |\n\n**Key Observations and Inferences:**\n\n1.  **Output Width:** The output width is consistently 3.\n2.  **Blue Line:** The vertical blue line in the input acts as a central axis.\n3.  **Azure Placement:** Azure pixels are placed in the output based on their position relative to the blue line in the input (left: column 0, right: column 2, on: column 1).\n4.  **Non-Azure Rows:** The critical error: If a row does *not* contain azure, and a blue line *does* exist, the code seems to assume that non-azure rows should have an azure 8 at output[row,1] and [row,2]. Instead, If a row in the input does *not* contain any azure pixels, then that row in the output grid should contain all zeros.\n5. **Output Height**: The transformed output height is always the same as the input height.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: variable\n      columns: variable\n      values: integers (0-9) representing colors\n\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: same as input_grid\n      columns: 3\n      values: integers (0, 8)\n\n  - name: blue_line\n    type: vertical line\n    properties:\n      color: blue (1)\n      column_index: variable\n      exists: boolean\n\n  - name: azure_pixels\n    type: pixels\n    properties:\n      color: azure (8)\n      positions: variable (relative to blue_line)\n\nactions:\n  - name: find_blue_line\n    input: input_grid\n    output: blue_line.column_index or -1 if not found\n\n  - name: determine_output_row\n    input: input_grid, row_index\n    output: output_grid, row_index, and azure placement\n\n  - name: place_azure\n    input: azure_pixels, blue_line.column_index, output_grid, row_index\n    output: output_grid with azure pixels placed in correct columns\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** Receive a 2D grid (`input_grid`) of integers (0-9).\n2.  **Blue Line Detection:** Find the vertical blue line (all pixels in a column are blue (1)) in the input grid. Note its column index. If no blue line is found, output all 0 grid with the dimensions of the input grid.\n3.  **Output Grid Initialization:** Create an output grid (`output_grid`) with the same number of rows as the input grid and 3 columns, initially filled with zeros (0).\n4.  **Row Iteration:** Iterate through each row of the `input_grid`.\n5.  **Azure Check:** For each row:\n    *   If the row contains *any* azure (8) pixels:\n        *   Iterate through the columns of the current row in the `input_grid`.\n        *   If an azure pixel is found:\n            *   If the azure pixel's column index is *less than* the blue line's column index, place an azure (8) in column 0 of the corresponding row in the `output_grid`.\n            *   If the azure pixel's column index is *greater than* the blue line's column index, place an azure (8) in column 2 of the corresponding row in the `output_grid`.\n            *   If the azure pixel's column index *is equal to* the blue line's column index, place an azure (8) in column 1 of the corresponding row of the output grid.\n    *   If the row does *not* contain any azure (8) pixels, the corresponding row in the `output_grid` remains all zeros (0).\n6.  **Output:** Return the `output_grid`.\n"
