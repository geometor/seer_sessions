Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2.  Identify all non-zero and non-grey (value not equal to 5) cells within the current row.
3.  Check Adjacency:
    *   If a cell is adjacent to a different non-zero and non-grey cell in the same row, sum all such adjacent cells and place this sum in place of the leftmost of the summed numbers.
    *   Change the value to 0 for all non-zero, non-grey cells that were summed.
    *   if a cell is not adjacent to any other non-zero and non-grey cell, set its value to 0 in the output.
4.  Copy all other cells (grey cells or cells not meeting the above criteria) directly from the input grid to the output grid without changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
