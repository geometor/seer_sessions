## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 3 2 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0 2
0 2 0 0 0 0
5 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x448 at 0x7BFC47FBB6D0>

**output:**
```
5 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0
5 0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x448 at 0x7BFC47584A00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by numbers. The input grid transforms into the output grid based on some rule related to the position and color of certain pixels. Specifically, it seems like green (3) and red (2) pixels might be changing to azure (8). The gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - gray (5)
        - green (3)
        - red (2)
        - azure (8)
      position: [row, column]
      changed: [boolean]

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: unknown
    target: pixel
    precondition:
      color: [green, red]
    postcondition:
      color: azure
    constraints:
        adjacency: "only applies to pixels adjacent to 2 and 3 but not to 0"

relationships:
   - type: adjacency
     relation: is_adjacent_to
     between: [pixel, pixel]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Locate all pixels that are green (value 3) or red (value 2).
2.  **Check gray**: do not change any colors if color is gray (5)
3.  **Change Color to Azure:** Change the color of the located green(3) and red(2) to azure (value 8)
4. **Preserve the rest:** All the other pixels remains unchaged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
