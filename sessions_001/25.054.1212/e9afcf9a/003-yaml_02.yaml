observations:
  example_1:
    input_colors: [3, 9]
    output_colors: [3, 9]
    pattern: alternating
    pattern_start: top_left
    relationship: |
       adjacent cells (horizontal and vertical) have different colors

  example_2:
    input_colors: [4, 8]
    output_colors: [4, 8]
    pattern: alternating
    pattern_start: top_left
    relationship: |
       adjacent cells (horizontal and vertical) have different colors

general:
    - The input consists of two rows, each of a single, but different, color.
    - The output maintains the two colors from the input.
    - The output establishes an alternating pattern of the two input colors.
    - The top-left cell of the output uses the color from the top-left cell of the input
