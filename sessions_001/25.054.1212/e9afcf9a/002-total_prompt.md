## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7BFC48A615A0>

**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7BFC48A62B30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2x6 grid of colored pixels into another 2x6 grid. The input grid consists of two horizontal rows: the top row is entirely green (color code 3), and the bottom row is entirely maroon (color code 9). The output grid retains the same dimensions but alters the arrangement of colors.  The transformation appears to involve an alternating pattern of colors within each row and between rows.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid is 2x6."
  - property: "Input grid top row: all pixels are green (3)."
  - property: "Input grid bottom row: all pixels are maroon (9)."
  - observation: "Output grid is 2x6."
  - property: "Output grid rows alternate colors."
  - property: "Output grid top row alternates green (3) and maroon (9)."
  - property: "Output grid bottom row alternates maroon (9) and green (3)."
  - relationship: "Output grid color alternation starts with green (3) in the top-left corner."
  - relationship: "Adjacent rows have inverted starting colors"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Maintain the original grid dimensions (2x6).

2.  **Row Alternation:** For the top row, alternate between green (3) and maroon (9), starting with green.

3.  **Row Inversion and Alternation:** For the bottom row, alternate between maroon (9) and green (3), starting with maroon. This creates an inversion of colors of the previous rows, maintaining the horizontal alternation.

In simpler, direct steps: Create an alternating pattern of green and maroon. The first cell is green. Adjacent cells (horizontal and vertical) can not have same color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
