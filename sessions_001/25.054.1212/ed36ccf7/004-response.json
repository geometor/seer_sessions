            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided data and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to compare pixel-by-pixel the input, expected output, and a *transformed* output, presumably from a hypothesized transformation function (which is currently missing, hence `transformed` is likely just a placeholder or an incorrect attempt).  The core issue is that we don't have the *actual* transformation function, only the *results* of some unknown, likely incorrect, transformation. Because of that, the `compare_grids` function correctly shows discrepancies, but it doesn't tell us *why* the transformation is wrong, or even *what* the transformation is supposed to be.  Our strategy will be to analyze the input and expected output pairs directly to *infer* the transformation rule, ignoring the \"transformed\" data for now.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from the provided input/expected pairs):**\n\nI'll reproduce the provided examples (without the incorrect `transformed` data) and derive observations manually, since I can't run code directly in this turn. I will focus on input/output grid pairs.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput:\n```\n[9, 0, 0]\n[9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n```\nExpected Output:\n```\n[0, 9, 9]\n[0, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n```\n\nObservations:\n*   The top-left maroon (9) pixel becomes white (0).\n*   The two white (0) pixels in the top row become maroon (9).\n*   The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n*   It looks like the top two pixels are swapping colors.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nInput:\n```\n[6, 6, 6]\n[0, 0, 0]\n[6, 6, 0]\n```\nExpected Output:\n```\n[6, 0, 0]\n[6, 0, 6]\n[6, 0, 6]\n```\n\nObservations:\n*   Top center and right magenta becomes white\n*   Left and center white becomes magenta\n*   Bottom center white becomes magenta\n*   Bottom right magenta becomes white.\n*  It *appears* as if magenta (6) and white (0) are swapping positions, but this is an incomplete swap since not *all* 0's become 6's and vice versa,\n\n**Example 3:**\nInput:\n```\n[0, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 9]\n[9, 9, 9]\n```\n\nExpected:\n```\n[9, 9, 9]\n[0, 0, 9]\n[0, 0, 9]\n```\nObservations:\n*   Top-left, top-center white become maroon\n*  Bottom-left, bottom-center maroon becomes white\n* Again, a partial swap.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\nInput:\n```\n[2, 0, 2]\n[0, 0, 2]\n[0, 2, 2]\n```\nExpected:\n```\n[2, 2, 2]\n[0, 0, 2]\n[2, 0, 0]\n```\nObservations:\n*   Top-center white becomes red.\n*   Bottom-left white becomes red.\n*   Bottom-center red becomes white.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: 9  # Maroon\n          positions: [[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]\n        - color: 0  # White\n          positions: [[0, 1], [0, 2]]\n      output_objects:\n        - color: 9\n          positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]\n        - color: 0\n          positions: [[0, 0]]\n      transformation: \"Partial color swap between maroon (9) and white (0) in specific locations.\"\n\n  - example_2:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: 6  # Magenta\n          positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [2, 0], [2, 1]]\n        - color: 0  # White\n          positions: [[1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2,2]]\n      output_objects:\n        - color: 6\n          positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [2,1], [1,2]]\n        - color: 0\n          positions:  [[0, 1], [0, 2], [2,2], [1,1]]\n      transformation: \"Partial color swap between magenta (6) and white (0).\"\n\n  - example_3:\n     input_objects:\n       - color: 9\n         positions: [[0,2], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]\n       - color: 0\n         positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]]\n     output_objects:\n       - color: 9\n         positions:  [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]]\n       - color: 0\n         positions: [[1,0], [1,1], [2,0], [2,1]]\n     transformation: \"Partial color swap between maroon (9) and white (0).\"\n  - example_4:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: 2\n          positions:  [[0,0], [0,2], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]\n        - color: 0\n          positions: [[0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [2,0]]\n      output_objects:\n        - color: 2\n          positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,2], [2,0]]\n        - color: 0\n          positions: [[1,0], [1,1], [2,1]]\n      transformation: \"Partial color swap between red (2) and white (0).\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify:** In each grid, find all instances of white(0) pixels and all instances of the non-white pixels present in the first row, first column of the grid.\n2.  **Swap (Partial):** If a White(0) pixel is to the *left* of the other color in the first row, it becomes the other color.  If a white(0) is above the other color in the first column, it becomes the other color. If the other color is to the left of White(0) in the first row, it becomes white(0). If the other color is *above* White(0) in the first column, it becomes White(0).\n3. **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nMore concisely, but perhaps less clear:\n\n\"Perform a partial color swap between white (0) pixels and the color of the pixel at input\\[0]\\[0]. The swap occurs based on relative positions of non-white and white pixels within only the first row and first column. Pixels not located in the first row or first column are not changed.\"\n"
