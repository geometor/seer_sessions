## Example 4

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 0 2
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48DA7D90>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 0 2
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47548520>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The grid cells contain either the value '0' (white) or '2' (red). The transformation appears to involve some form of manipulation of the red ('2') pixels, possibly a reflection or rotation. The white ('0') pixels seem to change their position in relation to the changes in the red pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: [pixel]

  - id: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      color: [white, red]
      value: [0, 2]

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Manipulates the position of red pixels, and potentially adjusts the position of white pixels.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 3x3 grid.
  - type: positional_change
    description: Red and white pixels potentially change their positions between input and output grids.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation of only the red pixels within the grid while inverting the colors (red and white positions switch).
Or, a 90 clockwise rotation and then swapping all 2s to 0s except in places where 2s overlap.

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with the value '2' (red).
2.  **Rotate:** Perform color swap with a clockwise rotation on all pixels.

Alternative:
1. Identify red cells
2. Rotate 90 degree clockwise
3. swap colors where new rotated cells overlap with the original red cells

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
