## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 0 0
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475A08E0>

**output:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475A0190>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains the colors maroon (9) and white (0). The output grid also contains maroon and white, but their positions are different. The transformation seems to involve a positional change of the colors, specifically a rotation or reflection.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [pixel]

pixels:
  - color: maroon (9)
    initial_positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]
    final_positions:  [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]
  - color: white (0)
    initial_positions: [[0,1], [0,2]]
    final_positions: [[0,0], [1,0]]

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: positional change of colors

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description:  Pixels maintain relative positions within their color groups, but the groups change position relative to each other.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid *after* isolating color groups . Alternatively, you could also view this as the white group moving to the left-most columns and the maroon group filling the space created on the right. The simplest view here is clockwise rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
