The input grid contains azure (8) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the addition of a single blue (1) pixel adjacent to existing azure pixels. The blue pixel appears to be placed where an azure pixel could potentially expand, maintaining a contiguous shape. It's a kind of \"hint\" at object expansion.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Select locations in this order\n    1.  to the left of the object\n    2.  above the object\n    3.  to the right of the object\n    4.  below the object\n3.  **Add Blue Pixel:** Place a single blue (1) pixel in the first valid selected location.
