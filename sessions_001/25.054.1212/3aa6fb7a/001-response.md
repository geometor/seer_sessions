Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 7x7 grids. The input grid contains azure (8) pixels against a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the addition of a single blue (1) pixel adjacent to existing azure pixels. The blue pixel appears to be placed where an azure pixel could potentially expand, maintaining a contiguous shape. It's a kind of "hint" at object expansion.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    type: grid
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
  - name: azure_shape_1
    type: shape
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
      - location: (row 2, column 2) , (row 3, column 2), (row 3, column 3)
  - name: azure_shape_2
    type: shape
    color: azure (8)
    properties:
     - location: (row 4, column 5) , (row 4, column 6), (row 5, column 6)
  - name: blue_hint
    type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    properties:
      - location: (adjacent to azure shape)

actions:
  - name: add_hint
    type: placement
    description: Place a single blue pixel adjacent to an existing azure shape, prioritizing left, then up, then right, then down.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: azure_shape and blue_hint
  - type: background_containment
    between: background and azure_shape
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Shapes:** Locate all contiguous shapes composed of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Select Hint Location:** For *each* azure shape, there might be multiple valid positions for placing the hint. Select locations in this order
    1.  to the left of the object
    2.  above the object
    3.  to the right of the object
    4.  below the object
3.  **Add Blue Pixel:** Place a single blue (1) pixel in the first valid selected location. Do this for all shapes.
4.  **Preserve Original:** All other pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

Essentially the rule finds azure objects, and puts a single blue pixel to their left if possible, or up, right or down if not.
