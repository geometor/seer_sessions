## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7BFC44390730>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 8 1 0 0 0
0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a numerical value corresponding to a color. The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in specific locations relative to the azure pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements: pixels
      color_map:
        0: white
        1: blue
        8: azure

  - type: pixel_cluster
    properties:
      color: azure
      shape: irregular # Not a consistent, predefined shape like a square or rectangle.
      movement: none # The azure clusters don't appear to be moving

actions:
  - type: insertion
    properties:
      color: blue
      location: adjacent_to: azure
      cardinality: one #one blue added for each touching side

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Blue pixels are placed adjacent to azure pixels.
    properties:
      directions: [left, right, up, down]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **For each azure pixel**:
    *   **Check** for adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right - not diagonally).
    *   **If** an adjacent cell is white (0) insert blue pixel and change value to (1).
3.  **Output** is the modified grid

The core concept appears to be a sort of "bordering" or "highlighting" operation, where blue pixels are placed adjacent to existing azure regions, changing white to blue on the sides that touch the existing azure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
