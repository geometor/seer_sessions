            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of placing a blue pixel adjacent to azure shapes is correct. However, the priority order for placement (left, above, right, below) and the selection of pixels to place next to within the azure shape needs adjustment. The current implementation seems to iterates through the azure shape and attempts to place pixels based on each position. This can cause inconsistent hint locations for connected objects.\nThe strategy needs refinement to provide a strict deterministic approach to selecting a single cell around each object to place the hint.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Consistent Hint Placement:** Instead of iterating through *all* pixels of an azure object and potentially placing multiple hints, or placing them inconsistently, we need a more robust way to determine a *single*, consistent location for the blue pixel hint relative to each *entire* azure object. We should find the bounding box of each object and then attempt to place the blue hint using the left-most and top-most positions of the object, then attempting left, above, right and below this point.\n\n2.  **Refine Object Identification and Hint Logic**:\n    - iterate each *object*\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating a more structured analysis:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n-   **Input:** Two azure objects: a vertical line and a horizontal line.\n-   **Expected Output:** Blue pixel to the right of the vertical line, and blue pixel above the horizontal line.\n-   **Transformed Output:** Blue pixel to the left of the vertical line, and blue pixel to the left of the horizontal line.\n-   **Analysis:** The current logic is *almost* correct, the priority placement of hints is incorrect.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n-   **Input:** Three azure objects: two individual pixels and a 2x1 horizontal line.\n-   **Expected Output:** Blue pixels correctly placed relative to each object (to the left where possible).\n-   **Transformed Output:** The hint is placed incorrectly. The placement logic is not consistent.\n-   **Analysis:** The inconsistent placement strategy is failing.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    - type: azure_shape\n      shape: vertical_line\n      bounding_box: [[1,1], [2,1]]\n      hint_location: right #expected\n      hint_placed: left #current\n      \n    - type: azure_shape\n      shape: horizontal_line\n      bounding_box: [[3, 4], [3, 5]]\n      hint_location: above\n      hint_placed: left\nexample_2:\n  objects:\n    - type: azure_shape\n      shape: single_pixel\n      bounding_box: [[0, 4], [0, 4]]\n      hint_location: left\n      hint_placed: above\n\n    - type: azure_shape\n      shape: single_pixel\n      bounding_box: [[1, 5], [1, 5]]\n      hint_location: left\n      hint_placed: left\n      \n    - type: azure_shape\n      shape: single_pixel\n      bounding_box: [[5, 3], [5, 3]]\n      hint_location: left\n      hint_placed: above\n\n    - type: azure_shape\n       shape: horizontal_line\n       bounding_box: [[2,2],[2,3]]\n       hint_placed: above\n       hint_location: left\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all distinct, contiguous shapes composed of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** For each azure object, determine its bounding box. This is the smallest rectangle that fully encloses the object.\n\n3.  **Prioritized Hint Placement:** For each azure object, attempt to place a single blue (1) pixel in the following order of priority, based on the *top-left* pixel of the object's bounding box (minimum row, then minimum column):\n    1.  **Left:** Place a blue pixel immediately to the left of the top-left corner of the bounding box, if the cell exists and is white(0).\n    2.  **Above:** If the left position is unavailable, place a blue pixel immediately above the top-left corner of the bounding box, if the cell exists and is white(0).\n    3.  **Right:** If both previous locations are not possible, check to place a blue pixel to the right of the *bottom-right* corner of the bounding box + 1 in x, if the cell exists and is white(0)\n    4.  **Below:** If all previous steps do not work, check to place the blue pixel below the *bottom-right* corner of the bounding box + 1 in y, if the cell exists and is white(0).\n\n4.  **Preserve Original:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not azure, or selected for hint placement, remain unchanged.\n"
