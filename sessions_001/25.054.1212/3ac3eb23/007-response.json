The primary colors involved seem to be white (0) and yellow (4). The input grid contains a single yellow pixel, while the output grid contains a pattern of yellow pixels arranged in vertical and horizontal lines.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This pixel's location serves as the origin.\n\n2.  **Vertical Line:** Create a vertical line of yellow (4) pixels, extending upwards and downwards from the origin. The line should extend to reach the edges of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Line:** Create a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels, extending leftwards and rightwards from the origin, extending all the way to reach the edges of the grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation creates a cross-shaped pattern of yellow pixels, centered on the location of the initial yellow pixel in the input grid. The lines of the cross extend to the boundaries of the grid.\n"
