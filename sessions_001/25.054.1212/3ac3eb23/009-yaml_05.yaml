observations:
  - object: seed_pixel
    properties:
      initial_color: non-black # Could be any color other than black (0)
      final_color: black (0)
      location: varies # Coordinates (row, col) within the grid
      uniqueness: single # Only one seed pixel per grid.
    behavior:
      change: "The initial color of the seed pixel changes to black (0)."

  - object: horizontal_line
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      start: seed_pixel_row
      end: edge_of_grid
      width: 1 # A single pixel wide line.
    behavior:
      draw: "A horizontal line of yellow pixels is drawn across the entire row of the seed pixel."

  - object: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      start: seed_pixel_col
      end: edge_of_grid
      width: 1
    behavior:
      draw: "A vertical line of yellow pixels is drawn across the entire column of the seed pixel."

  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable #rows and columns can change in each input
    behavior:
        transformation: "The input grid is changed based on seed location"
