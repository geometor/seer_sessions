Both grids have the same dimensions (3x10). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The primary difference between the input and output is the selective replacement of some '5' (gray) pixels with '3' (green) pixels. The positions of the '0' (white) pixels remain unchanged. It appears that not all '5's are replaced. There is likely a pattern of how the gray pixels change to green.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Then if there were any, move two spaces left and change another 5 to a 3.\n4.  **Conditional Replacement, Row 2:** In the second row, starting from the left, change the second '5' to a '3'. Then, moving two spaces to the right, change another '5' to '3' if there is one.\n5. **Conditional Replacement, Row 3:** In the third row, starting from the middle, change the '5' just left of the center between the two other '5' to '3'.\n6.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.\n\nEssentially, specific gray (5) pixels are replaced by green (3) pixels based on their position within each row and in relation to other gray pixels within their row.\n"
