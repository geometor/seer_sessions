The primary colors involved are gray (5), white (0), and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of gray (5) pixels with green (3) pixels based on their position, particularly in the first and second columns where they are adjacent to a white(0) pixel.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
