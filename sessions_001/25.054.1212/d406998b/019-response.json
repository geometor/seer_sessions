The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), white (0), and green (3). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x14). The transformation seems to involve selective replacement of gray (5) pixels with green (3) pixels based on some positional or contextual rule. The white pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Otherwise if it is gray (5), keep is unchanged.\n4. **Output:** present the modified grid as the output.\n\nEssentially, every third gray (5) pixel in a sequence on any given row changes color to become a green (3) pixel.\n"
