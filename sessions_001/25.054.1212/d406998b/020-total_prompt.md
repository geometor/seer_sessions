## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5
0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x192 at 0x7BFC47FBB6D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5 0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 3
0 3 0 3 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), white (0), and green (3). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x14). The transformation seems to involve selective replacement of gray (5) pixels with green (3) pixels based on some positional or contextual rule. The white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input and output are grids of the same dimensions
    dimensions: 3x14
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - gray (5)
        - green (3)
    observations:
      - white pixels remain unchanged
      - some gray pixels change to green
      - no new colors are introduced
  - action: replacement
    description: gray pixels are replaced by green pixels
    conditions:
      - appears to be based on column position and possibly neighboring colors
  - relation: spatial
    description: column position is relevant
    details:
      - the transformation pattern is not a simple global replacement; some 5s remain 5s
      - every third 5 in rows is consistantly transformed into a 3.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through each pixel of the grid, considering both its row and column position.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   If a pixel is white (0), keep it unchanged.
    *   If a pixel is gray (5), check its position in the sequence and if its is the third gray(5) pixel in the current row, replace it with green (3). Otherwise if it is gray (5), keep is unchanged.
4. **Output:** present the modified grid as the output.

Essentially, every third gray (5) pixel in a sequence on any given row changes color to become a green (3) pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
