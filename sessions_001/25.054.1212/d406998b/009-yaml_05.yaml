      - contains_pixels: [0, 3, 5] # white, green, gray
  - object: gray_pixel
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - can_transform: true
      - transform_to: green_pixel
  - object: green_pixel
    properties:

    description: "Change specific gray pixels to green pixels."
    conditions:
      - row_1: "column index of changed pixel alternates and skips adjacent pixels"
      - row_2: "A single gray pixel is changed on row 2, or none"
      - row_3: "if three gray pixels changed, then row 3 follows the pattern of skipping adjacencies"
