## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0
0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x192 at 0x7BFC47F93430>

**output:**
```
0 3 0 3 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 5 0
0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=768x192 at 0x7BFC47586050>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and green (3). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern of white and gray, and the output grid introduces green pixels in a seemingly selective manner. The core challenge is to determine the rule governing where the gray pixels in the input are replaced by the green pixels in the output, and do nothing on the grey pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    dimensions:
      rows: 3
      columns: 12
  - type: object
    description: Pixels are the fundamental objects.
    properties:
      color:
        values: [0, 3, 5]
        names: [white, green, gray]
  - type: pattern
    description: Input grid has an alternating pattern of white and gray pixels in the 1st row.
    details: "white, gray, white, gray..."
  - type: transformation
    description: Some gray pixels change to green.
    conditions: "Specific gray pixels, with no change in the location of the white."
  - type: rule:
    description: location that get a color change follow a pattern
    details: columns 2 and 4 in the 1st row get a color change
    details: column 8 in the 2nd row gets a color change
    details: column 6 and 10 and 12 in the 3rd row gets a color change
    pattern: +2 colums, +4 columns, +2 +2 columns
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Gray Pixel Identification:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid. Identify the pixels that are gray (value 5).
3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   In the first row, change the gray pixel to green in the second and forth column.
    *   In the second row, change the gray pixel to green in the eight column.
    *   In the third row, change the gray pixel to green in the sixth, tenth and twelfth column.
4. **Output:** Produce the modified grid as the output.

In summary. The transformation involves changing a subset of gray pixels to green based on a pattern related to the column index. The pattern of changes has +2 colums, +4 columns, +2 +2 columns on rows 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
