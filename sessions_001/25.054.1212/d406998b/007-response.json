The primary colors involved are white (0), gray (5), and green (3). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern of white and gray, and the output grid introduces green pixels in a seemingly selective manner. The core challenge is to determine the rule governing where the gray pixels in the input are replaced by the green pixels in the output, and do nothing on the grey pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Identify the pixels that are gray (value 5).\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   In the first row, change the gray pixel to green in the second and forth column.\n    *   In the second row, change the gray pixel to green in the eight column.\n    *   In the third row, change the gray pixel to green in the sixth, tenth and twelfth column.\n4. **Output:** Produce the modified grid as the output.\n\nIn summary. The transformation involves changing a subset of gray pixels to green based on a pattern related to the column index. The pattern of changes has +2 colums, +4 columns, +2 +2 columns on rows 1, 2 and 3, respectively.\n"
