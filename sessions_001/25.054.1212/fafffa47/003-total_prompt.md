Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Subgrids:** Divide the input grid into two 3x3 subgrids: a "top" subgrid (rows 1-3) and a "bottom" subgrid (rows 4-6).
2.  **Focus on Top Subgrid:** Disregard the "bottom" subgrid. The transformation operates solely on the "top" subgrid.
3. **Color Mapping:** Apply these color transformations:
    *   If a cell in the "top" subgrid is maroon (9), change it to red (2) in the output grid.
    *   If a cell in the "top" subgrid" is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
    * 	If a cell has any other value it is not included in the output
4.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying the color mapping to the "top" subgrid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
