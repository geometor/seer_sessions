The input grid appears to have two distinct regions: an upper region of maroon (9) and white(0), and a lower region of blue(1) and white(0). The output grid is smaller and consists primarily of white(0) and red(2) pixels. It's crucial to notice that only maroon and blue convert, the other color does not. The shape also changes from a 6x3 to a 3x3.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Within the bottom region, any blue(1) would map to red(2)\n    *   White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **Grid Resizing/Subsetting:** Create a new 3x3 grid.\n\n4. **Populate Output:**\n    * examine each cell of the top region of the input grid\n    * copy the top region color mapping output values to the output grid\n    * omit mapping of colors in the lower regions\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts and transforms the color information from the top half of the input grid and presents in the same position, while discarding the bottom half of the input. The key is the positional color mapping.\n"
