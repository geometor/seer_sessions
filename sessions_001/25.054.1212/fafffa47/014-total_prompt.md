## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 9 0
9 0 9
9 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7BFC47501750>

**output:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47502440>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (6x3) into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains three colors: white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1). The output grid contains white (0) and red (2). It appears that the non-white colors in the input grid are somehow mapped or converted to red in the output grid. The spatial relationship or arrangement of the colors seems significant. The input grid seems to be divided into 3x3 blocks of 2x1, in other words 3 sub grids where each sub grid height = 2 and width = 1.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 6x3
      colors: [white, maroon, blue]
      values:
        white: 0
        maroon: 9
        blue: 1
      block_structure:
        height: 2
        width: 1
        total_blocks: 9
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [white, red]
      values:
        white: 0
        red: 2
  - transformation_observations:
      - color_mapping:
          9: 2  # Maroon to Red
          1: 2  # Blue to Red
      - spatial_relationship: "Input grid is processed in 2x1 blocks and mapped to corresponding single cells in output grid"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide** the input grid (6x3) into nine 2x1 subgrids.
2.  **Iterate** through each of these subgrids.
3.  **Examine** the sub grid, find all of the non-white colors and set the output value to the new mapped color (9->2, 1->2). If no non-white colors, then skip this sub grid.
4. **Map** the sub grid to a single cell in the output (3x3) grid. If the 2x1 block contains *any* maroon (9) or blue(1) pixels, the corresponding output cell becomes red (2). Otherwise if they are all white then they stay as white (0).

Essentially, each 2x1 block in the input is reduced to a single cell in the output. If that 2x1 block contains any non-white color, the output cell is red (2); otherwise, it's white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
