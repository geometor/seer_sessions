The output grid's dimensions are half the height of the input grid and equal the width of the input and output grids.\n*   The input grid seems to be divided into two 3x3 subgrids, based on the image.\n*   The colors in the input grid are white (0), maroon (9), and blue (1).\n*   The colors in the output grid are red (2) and white (0).\n*\tIt appears the top 3x3 part of the input is the most important\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The transformation operates solely on the \"top\" subgrid.\n3. **Color Mapping:** Apply these color transformations:\n    *   If a cell in the \"top\" subgrid is maroon (9), change it to red (2) in the output grid.\n    *   If a cell in the \"top\" subgrid\" is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.\n    * \tIf a cell has any other value it is not included in the output\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying the color mapping to the \"top\" subgrid.\n\nEssentially, the program extracts the top 3x3 subgrid and performs a simple color substitution, mapping 9 to 2 and keeping 0 as is.\n"
