Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts the top half of the input grid (first three rows). 
Then, it translates the cells: if a cell in the top half is maroon (9), 
it becomes red (2) in the output grid. 
All other cells in the output grid are white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a 3x3 array filled with white (0).
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the top half of the input grid.
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            # Check if the current cell in the input grid is maroon (9).
            if input_grid[i][j] == 9:
                # If it's maroon, set the corresponding cell in the output grid to red (2).
                output_grid[i][j] = 2
            # Otherwise it will remain the initialized value of 0

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
