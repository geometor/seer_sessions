facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is always 6x3.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The input grid is partitioned into 2x1 subgrids.
  - observation: |
      There is a one-to-one mapping between each 2x1 subgrid in the input and a single cell in the output.
  - observation: |
     The subgrids are arranged in a 3x3 layout.
  - rule: |
      If a 2x1 subgrid contains a maroon (9) or blue (1) pixel, the corresponding output cell is red (2).
  - rule: |
      If a 2x1 subgrid contains neither maroon (9) nor blue (1), the corresponding output cell is white (0).
