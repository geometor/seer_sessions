"""
1.  **Identify Subgrids:** Divide the input grid into two 3x3 subgrids: a "top" subgrid (rows 1-3) and a "bottom" subgrid (rows 4-6).
2.  **Focus on Top Subgrid:** Disregard the "bottom" subgrid. The transformation operates solely on the "top" subgrid.
3. **Color Mapping:** Apply these color transformations:
    *   If a cell in the "top" subgrid is maroon (9), change it to red (2) in the output grid.
    *   If a cell in the "top" subgrid" is white (0), it remains white (0) in the output grid.
    * 	If a cell has any other value it is not included in the output
4.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying the color mapping to the "top" subgrid.
