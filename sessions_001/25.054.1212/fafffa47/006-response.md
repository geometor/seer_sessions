1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Isolate the top-left 3x3 section of the input grid.
2.  **Rotate:** Rotate this 3x3 subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
3.  **Color Mapping:** Within the *rotated* 3x3 subgrid:
    *   If a cell's color in the *rotated subgrid* was maroon (9) in the *original subgrid*, change it to red (2) in the output.
    *   If a cell's color in the *rotated subgrid* was white (0) in the *original subgrid*, it remains white (0) in the output.
    *   All other colors in the *original* 3x3 subgrid become white (0) in the output, irrespective of color changes in the rotated subgrid. It is critical that the color mapping be considered from the original input sub-grid, but the location of the output is from the rotated sub-grid.
4.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid after the color mapping is the final output.
