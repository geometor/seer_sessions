## Example 2

**input:**
```
9 0 9
0 9 9
0 0 9
1 0 1
1 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7BFC4890B7F0>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
0 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another, smaller grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have two distinct regions: an upper region of maroon (9) and white(0), and a lower region of blue(1) and white(0). The output grid is smaller and consists primarily of white(0) and red(2) pixels. It's crucial to notice that only maroon and blue convert, the other color does not. The shape also changes from a 6x3 to a 3x3.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid has two distinct regions based on color.
    details:
      - region_1: Top 3 rows, colors maroon (9) and white (0).
      - region_2: Bottom 3 rows, colors blue (1) and white (0).
  - observation: Output grid is smaller than input grid.
    details:
      - input_dimensions: 6x3
      - output_dimensions: 3x3
  - observation: Specific color mapping exists.
    details:
      - color_9: Replaced by color 2.
      - color_1: Replaced by color 2(doesn't appear).
      - color_0: Remains color 0.
  - observation: position of the 9s in the upper section correspond to position of the 2s in the output
    details:
     - upper_left_9: top_left_2 is not present
     - upper_center_9: top_center_2
     - upper_right_9: top_right_2 is not present
     - middle_left_9: middle_left_2 is not present
     - middle_center_9: middle_center_2 is not present
     - middle_right_9: middle_right_2 is not present
     - lower_left_9: bottom_left_2 is not present
     - lower_center_9: bottom_center_2
     - lower_right_9: bottom_right_2 is not present

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into two horizontal regions: the top three rows and the bottom three rows.

2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Within the top region, any maroon (9) pixel becomes red(2).
    *.  Within the bottom region, any blue(1) would map to red(2)
    *   White (0) pixels remain unchanged.

3.  **Grid Resizing/Subsetting:** Create a new 3x3 grid.

4. **Populate Output:**
    * examine each cell of the top region of the input grid
    * copy the top region color mapping output values to the output grid
    * omit mapping of colors in the lower regions

In essence, the transformation extracts and transforms the color information from the top half of the input grid and presents in the same position, while discarding the bottom half of the input. The key is the positional color mapping.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
