            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our understanding of the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (counting white pixels and always returning a 1x1 white grid) was too simplistic. While it worked for examples 1, 4, and 6, it failed for examples 2, 3, and 5. The common factor in the failing cases is that the expected output is a 1x1 grid with the value 8 (azure). This suggests the transformation rule is related to the presence or absence of the color azure (8), or possibly a more complex interaction between colors and their positions. It is likely a conditional - if something then output 8, else output 0.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the condition:** We need to determine the exact condition that dictates whether the output is 0 or 8. We'll examine the failing cases (2, 3, and 5) more closely, looking for common features related to the azure (8) pixels. We also need to check if the passing cases (1, 4, and 6) consistently *lack* this feature.\n2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Once we've pinpointed the condition, we'll update the natural language program to accurately describe the rule.\n3.  **Generate Improved Code:** Based on the refined program, generate new Python code.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's create a more structured analysis of each example:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Expected Output | Transformed Output | Match | Key Features                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :-------------- | :----------------- | :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | (5, 5)      | (1, 1)       | 0               | 0                  | True  | Azure (8) present, but not in a specific pattern                                                                                                                           |\n| 2       | (5, 7)      | (1, 1)       | 8               | 0                  | False | Azure (8) present, multiple instances. Output should be 8.                                                                                                                  |\n| 3       | (6, 7)      | (1, 1)       | 8               | 0                  | False | Azure (8) present, multiple instances. Output should be 8.                                                                                                                  |\n| 4       | (6, 7)      | (1, 1)       | 0               | 0                  | True  | Azure (8) present, output 0                                                                                                                                     |\n| 5       | (6, 7)      | (1, 1)       | 8               | 0                  | False | Azure (8) present, output should be 8                                                                                                                                          |\n| 6       | (6, 6)       | (1, 1)       | 0               | 0                  | True  | Azure (8) is present, output is 0.                                                                                                                   |\n\nIt appears that the mere presence of azure isn't enough to predict an azure output. Let's perform some targeted analysis using simplified inputs to investigate different scenarios.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    objects:\n      - color: 0  # White\n        count: 7\n      - color: 8  # Azure\n        count: 4\n      - color: 2  # Red\n        count: 4\n    output: 0\n    condition_met: false\n\n  - id: 2\n    objects:\n      - color: 0  # White\n        count: 12\n      - color: 8  # Azure\n        count: 7\n      - color: 2  # Red\n        count: 4\n    output: 8\n    condition_met: true\n\n  - id: 3\n    objects:\n      - color: 0  # White\n        count: 11\n      - color: 8  # Azure\n        count: 8\n      - color: 2  # Red\n        count: 6\n    output: 8\n    condition_met: true\n\n  - id: 4\n    objects:\n     - color: 0\n       count: 15\n     - color: 8\n       count: 9\n     - color: 2\n       count: 6\n    output: 0\n    condition_met: false\n    \n  - id: 5\n    objects:\n      - color: 0  # White\n        count: 13\n      - color: 8  # Azure\n        count: 8\n      - color: 2  # Red\n        count: 6\n    output: 8\n    condition_met: true\n\n  - id: 6\n    objects:\n      - color: 0 #white\n        count: 11\n      - color: 8 #azure\n        count: 8\n      - color: 2 #red\n        count: 6\n    output: 0\n    condition_met: false\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nAfter careful consideration of all examples, here's the updated natural language program:\n\n1.  The output grid is always 1x1.\n2.  Examine the input grid. If the number of azure pixels is greater than or equal to 7, the output grid's value is 8 (azure). Otherwise the value is 0 (white)\n\n"
