The output grid seems to represent a distillation or summarization of the input grid. The colors in the input grid are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). The output grid contains only a single azure (8) pixel. This suggests the task might involve identifying a specific color or object within the input and representing it in the output, perhaps based on dominance, uniqueness, or some other criteria.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It is somehow the most significant connected shape.\n\n2.  **Create** a 1x1 output grid.\n\n3.  **Set** the color of the single pixel in the output grid to the identified color (azure/8).\n\nIn essence, the transformation seems to reduce the input to its most salient feature/color represented as a single-pixel output. The key uncertainty lies in the precise rule for selecting that \"most salient\" color. It's likely related to a connected object.\n"
