The input grid consists of two colors (represented by numbers 8 and 6) arranged in a checkerboard pattern. The output grid expands this pattern, maintaining the checkerboard arrangement and replicating the original 2x2 block four times to form the new 4x4 shape. The numbers are laid out such that reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom, they represent a checkerboard pattern alternating 6 and 8.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The example begins with the colors azure (8) and magenta (6) are arranged in a 2x2 grid.\n2.  **Replicate:** Create a 4x4 grid.\n3. **Fill Pattern**: Fill the output grid by repeating the input pattern. The top-left 2x2 section of the output matches the input. Replicate the 2x2 block from the input across and down to complete the 4x4 block.\n4. **Maintain Alternation** Preserve color alternation of the checkerboard.\n5.  **Output:** Present the resulting 4x4 grid.\n\nEssentially the program takes a 2x2 input grid, and repeats its pattern in a 2x2 grid of 2x2 grids, to form the final 4x4 grid.\n"
