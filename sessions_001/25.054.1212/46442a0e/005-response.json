            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple replication/expansion strategy, where each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. This works for simple cases, but the provided examples demonstrate a more complex, perhaps rotational or mirroring, transformation. The consistent failure across multiple examples with different patterns confirms that the core logic needs adjustment. The consistent `size_correct: True` is interesting, and probably a coincidence. It's likely the size calculation is simple enough, however, it is something to double-check in context of a new natural language program.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input-output pairs, paying close attention to the *relative positions* of pixels.  The previous code was built without paying attention to the relative positions of objects, colors, or any other spatial relationship information, which resulted in poor performance.\n2.  **Identify the True Transformation:** Instead of simple replication, look for rotations, reflections, or other more complex manipulations.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Describe the *precise* transformation rule, and only the transformation rule.\n4.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Develop and refine the YAML block and natural language programs iteratively.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI'll use a more narrative approach, combining observations.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: A 2x2 grid with alternating magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: Shows a kind of swirling, interlocking pattern.\n    *   Observation: The original 2x2 input seems to be \"rotated and interlocked\". The output does *not* appear to be a straightforward scaling. The error lies in the *arrangement* of the output pixels.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: A 3x3 grid, mostly orange (7), with a vertical azure (8) stripe on the right.\n    *   Expected output: shows a repeating and interlocking pattern - it appears that the transformation has more complexity than just rotation or mirroring.\n    *   Observation: The output is *not* just a simple expansion of the blocks.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid, magenta (6) on the left, yellow (4) on the center and right bottom, and cyan (9) on the top right.\n    *   Expected Output: Again, a more intricate pattern than simple replication. It seems to interlock and repeat.\n    *   Observation: Confirms the pattern is not a straightforward expansion.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\ntask_004:\n  objects:\n    - input_grid:\n        type: grid\n        properties:\n          colors: [8, 6] # Example 1\n          height: 2\n          width: 2\n    - output_grid:\n        type: grid\n        properties:\n          colors: [8, 6] # Example 1\n          height: 4\n          width: 4\n  transformations:\n    - type: interlock_and_rotate\n      details: >\n          The input grid appears to be expanded, but with the cells rotated and interlocked. The transformation\n          does *not* appear to be straightforward rotation or mirroring. The transformation uses a more complex\n          method of interlocking and repeating patterns.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is double the height and width of the input grid.\n2.  **Interlocking Expansion:** Expand and interlock each of the original input grid cells. The expansion is not a\n    replication, and appears to involve interlocked rotation and mirroring.\n\nThis natural language program captures what seems to happen in these examples. We should go directly to the coding phase now.\n"
