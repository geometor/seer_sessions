## Example 1

**input:**
```
8 6
6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC475026E0>

**output:**
```
8 6 6 8
6 8 8 6
6 8 8 6
8 6 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC47500220>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small 2x2 grid into a larger 4x4 grid. The input grid consists of two colors (represented by numbers 8 and 6) arranged in a checkerboard pattern. The output grid expands this pattern, maintaining the checkerboard arrangement and replicating the original 2x2 block four times to form the new 4x4 shape. The numbers are laid out such that reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom, they represent a checkerboard pattern alternating 6 and 8.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements:
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        position: (0,0)
      - value: 6
        color: magenta
        position: (0,1)
      - value: 6
        color: magenta
        position: (1,0)
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        position: (1,1)
    pattern: checkerboard

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements:
      - value: 8
        color: azure
      - value: 6
        color: magenta
    pattern: checkerboard
    relationship: "replicated input grid, 2x2 -> 4x4"

  - type: transformation
    description: grid expansion
    rule: "Replicate the 2x2 input grid four times to create a 4x4 output grid, maintaining the checkerboard pattern."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe:** Examine the input 2x2 grid, noting the color and position of each cell. The example begins with the colors azure (8) and magenta (6) are arranged in a 2x2 grid.
2.  **Replicate:** Create a 4x4 grid.
3. **Fill Pattern**: Fill the output grid by repeating the input pattern. The top-left 2x2 section of the output matches the input. Replicate the 2x2 block from the input across and down to complete the 4x4 block.
4. **Maintain Alternation** Preserve color alternation of the checkerboard.
5.  **Output:** Present the resulting 4x4 grid.

Essentially the program takes a 2x2 input grid, and repeats its pattern in a 2x2 grid of 2x2 grids, to form the final 4x4 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
