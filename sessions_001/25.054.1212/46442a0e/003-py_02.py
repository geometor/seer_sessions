    # mock code execution results
    input_shape = (2, 2)
    output_shape = (4, 4)
    transformed_shape = (4, 4) # from previous results
    pixels_off = 8 # provided
    ```

    *   Observation: While the size is correct. the pattern of replicated pixels is not correct.
    *   Metrics: Input Shape: (2, 2), Output Shape: (4, 4), Transformed Shape: (4, 4), Pixels Off: 8.

*   **Example 2:**
    ```python
    # mock code execution results
    input_shape = (3, 3)
    output_shape = (6, 6)
    transformed_shape = (4,4) # from previous results
    ```

    *   Observation: The transformed output size is incorrect, as it's fixed to 4x4. The replication pattern is not considered.
    *   Metrics: Input Shape: (3, 3), Output Shape: (6, 6), Transformed Shape: (4, 4).

*   **Example 3:**

    ```python
    # mock code execution results
    input_shape = (3, 3)
    output_shape = (6, 6)
    transformed_shape = (4,4) # from previous result
    ```

    *   Observation: Similar to Example 2, the transformed output size is wrong, and there's no handling of the 3x3 input pattern.
    *   Metrics: Input Shape: (3, 3), Output Shape: (6, 6), Transformed Shape: (4, 4).
