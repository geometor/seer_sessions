Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a simple replication/expansion strategy, where each pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. This works for simple cases, but the provided examples demonstrate a more complex, perhaps rotational or mirroring, transformation. The consistent failure across multiple examples with different patterns confirms that the core logic needs adjustment. The consistent `size_correct: True` is interesting, and probably a coincidence. It's likely the size calculation is simple enough, however, it is something to double-check in context of a new natural language program.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input-output pairs, paying close attention to the *relative positions* of pixels.  The previous code was built without paying attention to the relative positions of objects, colors, or any other spatial relationship information, which resulted in poor performance.
2.  **Identify the True Transformation:** Instead of simple replication, look for rotations, reflections, or other more complex manipulations.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Describe the *precise* transformation rule, and only the transformation rule.
4.  **Hypothesize and Test:** Develop and refine the YAML block and natural language programs iteratively.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

I'll use a more narrative approach, combining observations.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A 2x2 grid with alternating magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels.
    *   Expected Output: Shows a kind of swirling, interlocking pattern.
    *   Observation: The original 2x2 input seems to be "rotated and interlocked". The output does *not* appear to be a straightforward scaling. The error lies in the *arrangement* of the output pixels.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: A 3x3 grid, mostly orange (7), with a vertical azure (8) stripe on the right.
    *   Expected output: shows a repeating and interlocking pattern - it appears that the transformation has more complexity than just rotation or mirroring.
    *   Observation: The output is *not* just a simple expansion of the blocks.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid, magenta (6) on the left, yellow (4) on the center and right bottom, and cyan (9) on the top right.
    *   Expected Output: Again, a more intricate pattern than simple replication. It seems to interlock and repeat.
    *   Observation: Confirms the pattern is not a straightforward expansion.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
task_004:
  objects:
    - input_grid:
        type: grid
        properties:
          colors: [8, 6] # Example 1
          height: 2
          width: 2
    - output_grid:
        type: grid
        properties:
          colors: [8, 6] # Example 1
          height: 4
          width: 4
  transformations:
    - type: interlock_and_rotate
      details: >
          The input grid appears to be expanded, but with the cells rotated and interlocked. The transformation
          does *not* appear to be straightforward rotation or mirroring. The transformation uses a more complex
          method of interlocking and repeating patterns.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is double the height and width of the input grid.
2.  **Interlocking Expansion:** Expand and interlock each of the original input grid cells. The expansion is not a
    replication, and appears to involve interlocked rotation and mirroring.

This natural language program captures what seems to happen in these examples. We should go directly to the coding phase now.
