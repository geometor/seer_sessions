  transformations:
    - type: interlock_and_rotate
      details: >
          The input grid appears to be expanded, but with the cells rotated and interlocked. The transformation
          does *not* appear to be straightforward rotation or mirroring. The transformation uses a more complex
          method of interlocking and repeating patterns.
