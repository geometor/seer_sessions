    *   Attempted Output has changed row 1: `4 4 4 4 4 4 4`
        *   Observation: Row 4,5 both have changes. Row 4 outer pixels are changed to yellow.
        *   Observation: Row 5, *second* pixel in from each side is changed to yellow.
*   **Common Observations:**

    *   Changes only happen in rows that are all white (all `0`) in the input
    *   The *edges* of wholly white rows seem particularly significant. The specific change on the edge depends on how many all-white rows there are contiguously.
