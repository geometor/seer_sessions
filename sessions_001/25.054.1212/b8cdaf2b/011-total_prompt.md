1.  **Copy Bottom Row:** Preserve the entire bottom row of the input grid in the output grid.
2.  **Find Bottom Row Non-Zero Pixels**: Identify all colors in the bottom row that are non-zero.
3. **Replicate and Offset:** For each identified non-zero pixel:

    *   Replicate the colors of the pixels identified in the bottom row.
    *   Place copies in a cross shape in the rows above with positions offset -1 and +1 from the original columns in the bottom row
    *  Stop at row 0, so do not extend beyond the size of the input grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
