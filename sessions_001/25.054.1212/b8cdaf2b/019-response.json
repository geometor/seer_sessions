The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The input grid seems to have a distinct pattern in the bottom two rows, while the output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels in a seemingly specific arrangement within a region that was previously all white (0). The bottom two rows remain constant, but there may be subtle operations.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The bottom section of red and yellow rows stays the same.\n"
