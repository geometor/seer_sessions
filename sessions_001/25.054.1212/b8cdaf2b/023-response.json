            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code correctly identified the boundary line concept. However, the shape placement and, critically, the *number* of shapes added are incorrect. The code adds shapes based on the first and last zero in boundary_row -1. The examples show that multiple \"L\" shaped objects are added, and their color is related to the row immediately below the boundary row. The main issue is that the logic only considers the *outermost* blank (0) cells for placing the mirrored shapes, instead of considering *all* blank cells above the colored region and building L shapes on empty spaces.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Refine Boundary Detection:** Ensure that the `find_boundary_row` function is robust and works even when multiple uniform-color rows exist at the bottom. The current implementation seems correct.\n2.  **Improve Shape Placement:** Instead of finding only the leftmost and rightmost columns of the zeros, we should use all relevant positions to build the new shape.\n3.  **Correct Shape Definition and Count:** Implement the \"L\" shape correctly. The current approach adds at most two single pixels and then makes an L, it's wrong. The L shapes appears to be added in all available places and not depend on any other logic.\n4.  **Accurate Color Determination:** Ensure that the shape's color is picked consistently from the multi-colored row below the boundary.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution Results - Summary):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels off: 2 (two pixels of color 4 missing)\n    *   Notes: The code failed to add the \"L\" shape, which would include pixels above the boundary.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels off: 4\n    *   Notes: Similar to Example 1, it missed placing the \"L\" shapes, and the color used should be 3.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels off: 2\n    *   Notes: Missed \"L\" placement with color 1.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Pixels off: 4\n    *  Notes: \"L\" placement is missing, color should have been 4.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task_id: 022\n  - objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties:\n          - contains_rows_of_uniform_color: true\n          - contains_rows_of_multiple_colors: true\n          - boundary_exists: true\n      - type: boundary\n        properties:\n          - defined_by: row_separating_uniform_and_multi_color_rows\n          - location: above_multi_color_row\n      - type: shape\n        properties:\n          - shape_type: L\n          - orientation: varies (normal and mirrored)\n          - color_source: row_below_boundary\n          - position: above_boundary_at_empty_cells\n      - type: color\n        properties:\n          -color_logic: get color from pixel in row below boundary\n\n  - actions:\n      - type: add_shape\n        details: Add \"L\" shaped objects above the boundary at available positions.\n        conditions:\n          - location_relative_to_boundary: above\n          - color_determined_by: row_below_boundary\n          - shape_determined_by: L_shape composed by two pixels\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Boundary:** Find the boundary row. This is the row immediately above the topmost row that contains more than one color.\n2.  **Determine Shape Color:** The shape color is taken from the multi-colored row immediately below the boundary.\n3.   Scan the area above the boundary.\n4. Find empty positions.\n5.  **Add \"L\" Shapes:** For each blank (value 0) cell in the row immediately above the boundary row:\n   -   Add two pixel shape using the color found. The two pixel form an \"L\" shape, placed at the empty position.\n   -   Build the \"L\" shape using the following rule. If cell (r,c) is empty and cell (r+1, c) has color X, then set cell (r,c) and cell (r-1, c+1) or (r-1, c-1) using color X.\n   -   The direction of L shape should consider all available cells on top of the boundary.\n\n"
