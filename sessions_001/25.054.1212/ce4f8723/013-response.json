The output is a smaller grid. There's a clear relationship between the size and content of the input and output. The top portion of the input seems to be the main focus, with the bottom sections seeming to play a secondary role. Specifically the first 4 rows x 4 columns seems to translate directly to the output, with values of `1` becoming `3`.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
