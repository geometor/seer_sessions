task: 002
description: |
  The task involves downsampling a larger input grid to a 4x4 output grid.
  The transformation rule is based on the top-left 4x4 subgrid of the input.
  Non-white pixels within this input subgrid are converted to green in the output grid, while white pixels remain white.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
