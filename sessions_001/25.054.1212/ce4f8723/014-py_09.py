1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the top-left 4x4 subgrid from the input grid.
2.  **Recolor:** Within the extracted subgrid, replace all occurrences of the value '1' (blue) with the value '3' (green). The value '0' (white) should remain unchanged.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 subgrid after the recoloring is the output.
