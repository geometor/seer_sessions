Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the top-left 4x4 subgrid from the input grid.
2.  **Recolor:** Within the extracted subgrid, replace all occurrences of the value '1' (blue) with the value '3' (green).
3. **Identify Change Locations:** Store the coordinates (row, col) where the color change from 1 to 3 occurred.
4.  **Propagate Change**: Iterate through the changed locations. For each location, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is white (0), change it to green (3).
5.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 subgrid after the recoloring and propagation is the output.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to refine the solution:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the 4x4 subgrid extraction and the initial blue-to-green color change, it failed to accurately model the propagation rule. The original propagation rule was overly aggressive, changing *all* white neighbors to green. The examples demonstrate a more nuanced propagation: It seems green only propagates to white pixels if they are *adjacent* to a pixel that was *originally* blue and became green. The code changes all white neighbors which is incorrect.

**Strategy:**
1.  **Refine Propagation Rule:** The core issue is the propagation. We need to modify the rule to reflect that only the neighbors of *originally blue* pixels (which turned green) that are white should turn green. The current code incorrectly stores this but uses it in the incorrect spot.
2. **Check Examples:** Carefully re-examine the examples and how the green color spreads to make sure the rule is accurate.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the propagation:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Initial Blues: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,2)
    *   Propagation observations:
        *   (0,0) -> (0,2) white turns to green
        *   (0,1) -> (0,2) & (0,3) white turns to green
        *   (1,1) -> no change to (1,0) black or (1,2) white
        *   (2,1) -> no change to (2,0) or (2,2)
        *    (3,0) -> no change to (3,1)
        *    (3,2) -> no change to (3,1) or (3,3)
*   **Example 2:**
     *  Initial Blues: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3)
    *   Propagation observations:
        *   (0,2) -> (0,3) white turns green
        *    (2,2) -> (2,1) doesn't propagate since it isn't white

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Initial Blues: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
    *   Propagation observations:
      * (0,1) changes (0,2) to green

*   **Example 4:**
     *  Initial Blues: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1)
    *   Propagation observations:
         *  (0,0) changes (0,1) white
         *  (1,1) changes (1,2)

**YAML Fact Block:**

  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0-9] # All possible colors
      dimensions: variable

  - name: subgrid
    type: grid

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid
    output: subgrid

  - name: recolor_blue
    input: subgrid
    process:
      - Find all pixels with color 1 (blue)
      - Change their color to 3 (green)
      - Store original locations of these blue pixels
    output: modified subgrid

  - name: propagate_green
    input:
      - modified subgrid
      - locations of originally blue pixels
    process:
      - For each originally blue pixel:
        - Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
        - If a neighbor is white (0), change it to green (3).
    output: final_output_grid
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the top-left 4x4 subgrid from the input grid.
2.  **Recolor Blue Pixels:** Within the extracted subgrid, locate all blue (1) pixels. Change these pixels to green (3). *Crucially*, record the original locations of these blue pixels *before* they were changed.
3.  **Propagate Green Conditionally:** Iterate through the *original* locations of the blue pixels (now green). For *each* of these locations:
    *   Check its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right).
    *   If a neighboring pixel is white (0), change it to green (3).
    *   If a neighbor is any other color, do *not* change it.
4.  **Output:** The resulting 4x4 subgrid, after the recoloring and conditional propagation, is the output.

The key improvement is step 3, clearly specifying that propagation is tied to the *original* blue pixel locations, and not just any green pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
