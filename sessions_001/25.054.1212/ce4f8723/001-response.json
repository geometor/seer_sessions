The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be primarily green (3) and white (0). There's a clear reduction in size, suggesting a downscaling or summarizing operation. The colors in the input grid do not seem to have a directly corresponding color in the output, so some relationship between areas of the larger grid map to specific color values in the smaller grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
