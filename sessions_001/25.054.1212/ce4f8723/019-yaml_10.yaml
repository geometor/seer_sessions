observations:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [9, 4]  # Height x Width
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 4] # white, blue, red, yellow
      regions:
        - color: 1 #blue
          shape: irregular
          location: top_left
        - color: 4 #yellow
          shape: rectangular
          location: middle
        - color: 2 #red
          shape: irregular, split
          location: bottom
        - color: 0
          shape: fills remainder
          location: scattered
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [4, 4]
      colors: [0,3] #White, Green
      regions:
        - color: 3
          shape: almost_full_grid
          location: fills all except [3,0]
        - color: 0
          shape: single pixel
          location: [3, 0]
  - transformations:
      - dimension_reduction: Input grid is larger than output
      - color_change:
          rule: "Most colors consolidate to 3.  Isolated '0' persists."
