Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find Green Pixels:** Identify all pixels with a value of 3 (green).

2.  **Top Row Transformation:** For any green pixel in the top row (row 0):
    * Check the color of the pixel directly below.
        * If the pixel directly below is azure, change it to white (0).
        * If the pixel directly below is NOT azure, change it to azure (8).
        
3.  **Bottom-Left Transformation:** If a green pixel is in the bottom-left corner (last row, column 0), change its color to azure (8).

4. **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
