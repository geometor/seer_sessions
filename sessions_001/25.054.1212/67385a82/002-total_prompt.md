## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 0
0 3 0
3 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47547A30>

**output:**
```
8 8 0
0 8 0
3 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475458A0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The transformation appears to be dependent on the initial values within the input grid.  Specifically, some colors in specific locations change, while others remain the same.  The key seems to be related to the green (3) and white (0) pixels in the input, and their locations in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - observation: Output is a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - values: Integers range from 0 to 9, representing colors.
  - input_grid:
    - row_1: [3, 3, 0]
    - row_2: [0, 3, 0]
    - row_3: [3, 0, 3]
  - output_grid:
    - row_1: [8, 8, 0]
    - row_2: [0, 8, 0]
    - row_3: [3, 0, 3]
  - transformation: Green (3) in the top left and top middle of the input become azure (8).
  - transformation: White (0) remains unchanged.
  - transformation:  Green(3) in bottom left and bottom right remains.
  - transformation: Green (3) at center becomes Azure (8).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   If a cell is white (0), keep its value as 0.
    *   If a cell is green (3) AND it's located in the top two rows change to Azure (8).
    * If it is Green (3) and is in the bottom row, keep it as green (3).

This program describes a conditional color change based on position in the input matrix.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
