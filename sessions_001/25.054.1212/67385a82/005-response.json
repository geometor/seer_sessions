            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to improve the natural language program and subsequently the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a flawed interpretation of the transformation rule, focusing too heavily on the presence or absence of green in the bottom row as a global condition.  The results clearly show that the transformation of green to azure is related to the row position of the green pixel, *regardless* of green elsewhere.  The code *incorrectly* assumed that the bottom-row green acted as a \"switch\" for the entire grid. The examples demonstrate that *all* green pixels in the top two rows are consistently transformed to azure, and green pixels in the lower rows remain green.\n\nThe strategy is to shift from a global condition (bottom-row green) to a strictly row-based condition for the transformation of green pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of the results, re-emphasizing the key misunderstanding:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code failed to change the green pixels in the top two rows to azure.  The bottom-row green check incorrectly prevented this.\n*   **Example 2:** Same as Example 1. The top-row greens should have changed, but didn't.\n*   **Example 3:** Same issue. All top two row greens should be azure.\n*   **Example 4:** Same issue.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 004b5748\nexamples:\n  - id: example_1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_1: { color: green, positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1], [2, 0], [2, 2]] }\n      - object_2: { color: white, positions: [[0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]] }\n    output_objects:\n      - object_1: { color: azure, positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1]]}\n      - object_2: { color: white, positions: [[0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]] }\n      - object_3: { color: green, positions: [[2, 0], [2, 2]]}\n    transformation: \"Green pixels in rows 0 and 1 change to azure.

It focuses on the individual green pixel's location, specifically its row index.\n"
