            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the results, and updated documentation:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was too specific, only working correctly for the first example. It incorrectly assumed that the row condition (top two rows) applies to *all* green pixels. The subsequent examples reveal a more complex rule: green pixels turn azure only if they are in the top two rows *and* there are no green pixels in the bottom row of the *entire grid*. The presence of green in the bottom row seems to \"protect\" other green pixels from changing. We need to modify the logic to incorporate this grid-level check, not just a row-local check.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (using provided results, not code execution for this dreamer stage)**\n\nHere's a table summarizing the provided results.\n\n| Example | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Palette Correct | Pixel Counts Correct | Notes                                                                                                                     |\n|---------|-------|------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | True  | 0          | True         | True            | True                  | Perfect match. The initial rule works here because there's green in the bottom row.                                   |\n| 2       | False | 1          | True         | True            | False                 | One pixel mismatch. Top-right green should not have changed to azure.  No Green is present on the bottom row.         |\n| 3       | False | 5          | True         | True            | False                 | Many mismatches.  The presence of green in the bottom row should have \"protected\" all other greens.                   |\n| 4       | False | 5          | True         | True            | False                 | Many mismatches, similar to example 3. Green in bottom row should protect.  Also shows interaction in top 2 rows is valid. |\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   **Global Condition:** The transformation of green pixels depends on a *global* property of the grid (presence/absence of green in the bottom row), not just the local row of the pixel being considered.\n*   **Protection:** The presence of green (3) in the bottom row prevents the change of green to azure in the top two rows.\n*   **Unchanged Pixels:**  White (0) and other colored pixels always seem to remain unchanged.  The code correctly handles this.\n*   **Size and Colors:**  All examples maintain the original grid size, and the color palette consists of only white, green, and azure, plus any colors that were unchanged from input to output.\n\n**YAML Documentation (Facts)**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: grid\n    properties:\n      rows: variable\n      columns: variable\n      colors: [white, green, azure, others] # others refers to pixels not changed\n    observations:\n      - bottom_row_contains_green: boolean  # Flag: True if any green in the bottom row.\n\nactions:\n  - name: transform_pixel\n    preconditions:\n      - pixel_color: green\n      - location: [row, col]\n    conditional_actions:\n        - condition: \"AND(location.row < 2, NOT(bottom_row_contains_green))\"\n          action: \"change pixel_color to azure\"\n        - condition: \"OR(location.row >=2, bottom_row_contains_green)\"\n          action: \"no change\"  # Explicitly stating no change for clarity.\n    constraints:\n        - \"pixels of colors other than green remain unchanged\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Examine the entire grid:** Check if there are *any* green (3) pixels in the *bottom* row.\n2.  **Iterate through each pixel:** For each pixel:\n    *   If the pixel is *not* green (3), leave it unchanged.\n    *   If the pixel *is* green (3):\n        *   If the pixel is in the top two rows (row index 0 or 1) *AND* there are *no* green pixels in the bottom row of the grid, change the pixel to azure (8).\n        *   Otherwise (if the pixel is in the bottom row, *OR* if there *are* green pixels in the bottom row), leave the green pixel unchanged.\n\nThis natural language program captures the global dependency discovered by analyzing the provided results. It clearly distinguishes between the grid-level check and the per-pixel transformation.\n"
