            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too specific to the first training example. While it correctly identified the relationship between the green and azure pixels, it failed to generalize the rule correctly. The condition `if green_pixel[0] == first_green_row:` is too restrictive and doesn't consider green pixels in other rows, as seen in examples 2, 3, and 4. The rule is meant change the azure colored pixel that are green-adjacent, only if it is the first azure object, and at the right-side of green pixel, which is making the code incorrectly handle cases where we have objects to transform not at first object. The hardcoding of specific coordinate is not good approach.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Remove Row Restriction:** Eliminate the condition that limits the transformation to the first row of green pixels. The transformation should apply to any green pixel adjacent to an azure one.\n\n2.  **Improve Adjacency and Object Logic:** Make the code to focus only on right-side adjacency, instead of all around.\n\n3. **Fixing the Object Approach**: The azure that will be affected by the rule is the first one that appear.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations and potential issues:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[8, 8, 0], [0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 3]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0], [3, 0, 3]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[8, 8, 0], [0, 8, 0], [3, 0, 3]]`\n    *   **Analysis:** Correct. The azure pixel to the right of the green pixel in the first green row changed to azure.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   **Analysis:** Incorrect. The azure pixel to the right of the green pixel in the *first* row should have changed to azure.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[8, 8, 0, 3], [8, 8, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 8, 8]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 8, 0, 3], [8, 8, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 8, 8]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[8, 8, 0, 3], [8, 8, 0, 0], [3, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 8, 8]]`\n    *   **Analysis:** Incorrect. The azure pixel to the right of the green pixel, at the first row, should change to azure. Also the azure at the right of the other green object.\n\n*    **Example 4:**\n    *   Input:  `[[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3]]`\n    *   Actual Output: `[[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3]]`\n    *   **Analysis:** Correct.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: green\n    type: contiguous_block\n    action: source_of_change\n  - color: azure\n    type: contiguous_block\n    action: target_of_change, first_object_rule\n\nactions:\n  - description: Change azure pixel color, to azure, that is right-adjacent to a green pixel, only if is the first object.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks (objects) of green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels.\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** Iterate through each green object. For each green pixel, check its right-side adjacent pixel. If the adjacent pixel is azure and belongs to the first azure object, change the azure pixel to azure.\n"
