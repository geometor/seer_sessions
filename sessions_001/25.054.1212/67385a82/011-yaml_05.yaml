    properties:
      color: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
      value: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    properties:
      color: green

actions:
  - name: identify_runs
    description: Find all horizontal runs of green pixels.
  - name: change_color
    description: Change the color of pixels in a run to azure.
    conditions:
      - if run_length >= 2
      - if run_length == 1 and adjacent to azure pixel (after initial transformation)

rules:
  - "Runs of green pixels with length 2 or more are changed to azure."
  - "After changing runs of length >=2, single green pixels adjacent to azure pixels *horizontally* are also changed to azure."
  - adjacency_rule: "check left, and right."
