Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed based on a single example, and as expected, it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The `analyze_grid_diff` function is helpful for pinpointing discrepancies, revealing that size mismatches and incorrect pixel placements are the primary issues. The core problem is that the transformation rule derived from the first example is too specific and doesn't capture the underlying pattern applicable to all cases. The initial attempt focused on a very specific color replacement and simple expansion, which isn't universally valid.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Discard the initial, overly specific transformation rule. Go back to the original examples and look for a more general pattern of object manipulation, size changes, and color transformations. Pay close attention to how input shapes relate to output shapes.
2.  **Focus on Object Properties:** Identify objects (contiguous regions of the same color) within the input grids. Note their size, shape, color, and position. Do the same for the output grids.
3.  **Look for Relative Changes:** Instead of absolute rules (e.g., "replace red with azure"), look for *relationships* between input and output objects. For example, does an input object get duplicated? Does its size change by a consistent factor? Does its position shift? Does a color change follow some ordering?
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Develop a new natural language program based on these broader observations. Generate new Python code. Test it against *all* training examples. Use the `analyze_grid_diff` function to identify remaining errors. Repeat the process, refining the natural language program and the code until all training examples are handled correctly.
5. **Handle Edge Cases:** check sizes, colors, shapes, positions for inconsistencies.

**Metrics and Observations (using `analyze_grid_diff` output):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Pixels Off: 12
    *   Size Correct: False
    *   Color Palette Correct: False
    *   Input Colors: {2: 2, 0: 7}
    *   Expected Colors: {2: 4, 0: 14, 8: 18}
    *   Transformed Colors: {8: 26, 0: 7, 2: 3}

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Transformed output is None (likely due to an error).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Pixels Off: 12
    *   Size Correct: False
    *   Color Palette Correct: False
    *   Input Colors: {0: 3, 4: 1}
    *   Expected Colors: {0: 12, 4: 4, 8: 4}
    *   Transformed Colors: {8: 14, 0: 1, 4: 1}

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The output grid is created by expanding the input grid. The number of rows in the output is double the number of rows in the input. The number of columns in the output is double the number of columns in the input, *plus* the number of unique non-zero colors in the input
2.  **Color Alternation:** For each cell in the input, two cells are created in the output. The first cell created has the same color. The next adjacent cell is 'azure' (color 8).
3. **New Columns:** create a new column after each original input column, fill the new column with 'azure' (color 8)

This revised program is a hypothesis that addresses the observed expansion and color changes.
It combines observations across all examples rather than fitting only to the first. It is still potentially flawed, but it's a much better starting point than the previous one.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
