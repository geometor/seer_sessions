Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, with the primary colors appearing to be white (0), gray (5), and azure (8). The input grid seems to be transformed into a larger output grid. The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or replication, and a new color (azure, 8) is introduced. The gray (5) pixels seem to trigger the placement of azure, and some concept of mirroring the size of object 5 to the border with object 8.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input grid is 6x6, and the output grid is 12x12."
  - observation: "The input grid contains colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray)."
  - observation: "The output grid contains colors 0 (white), 5 (gray), and 8 (azure)."
  - object: gray_pixel
    color: 5
    properties:
      initial_positions: [(0,1), (4,0), (4,5)]
      behavior: "Seems to trigger the appearance of azure (8) in surrounding cells."
  - object: azure_pixel
    color: 8
    properties:
      behavior: "Surrounds and extends a copy of gray positions to edges of the grid, except where blocked by 0."
  - relationship: "The output grid is double the dimensions of the input grid."
  - action: "expansion"
    description: "The grid is expanded from 6x6 to 12x12."
  - action: "color_introduction"
    description: "The color azure (8) is introduced in the output."
  - action: "replication"
    description: "gray_pixel is surrounded by azure and expanded"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand the grid:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to create the output grid.
2.  **Copy and Extend Grey:** all grey object in input are present in the output. Add azure next to each grey, expanding a copy of the grey objects to the border.
3. **Border Exception:** azure pixels should always be present at the border, so no need to extend the border.
