The input grid seems to be transformed into a larger output grid. The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or replication, and a new color (azure, 8) is introduced. The gray (5) pixels seem to trigger the placement of azure, and some concept of mirroring the size of object 5 to the border with object 8.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
