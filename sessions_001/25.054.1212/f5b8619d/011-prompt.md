1. Double Dimensions: Create an output grid with twice the height and twice the width of the input grid.
2. Iterate Input Pixels: For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   Get its color and its row (r) and column (c) coordinates.
    *   In the output grid, create a 2x2 block at the starting position (2*r, 2*c).
    *   Place the input pixel's color at the top-left corner of this block: `output_grid[2*r, 2*c] = input_pixel_color`.
    *   Fill the remaining three positions of the 2x2 block with azure (8):
        *   `output_grid[2*r + 1, 2*c] = 8`
        *   `output_grid[2*r, 2*c + 1] = 8`
        *   `output_grid[2*r + 1, 2*c + 1] = 8`
3. Return the output grid

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
