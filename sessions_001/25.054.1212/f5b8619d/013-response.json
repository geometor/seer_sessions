The input grid appears to contain a pattern that is expanded and potentially replicated in the output grid. Colors (represented by numbers) are preserved and seem to be a key element of the transformation. There is a change in size, and duplication. There's possibly, reflection.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
