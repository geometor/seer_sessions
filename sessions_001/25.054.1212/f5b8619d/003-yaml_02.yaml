observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
    transformations:
      - type: expansion
        properties:
          - output_dimensions: calculated, not simply doubled
          - value_replication: patterned, not direct offset
          - filler_value: 8 (azure)
          - filler_pattern: alternating with original values, potentially based on adjacency or row/column parity
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
     - dimensions: derived from input and expansion rule
     - values: combination of replicated input values and filler value (8)
