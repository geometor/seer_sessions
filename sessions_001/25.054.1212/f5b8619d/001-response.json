The colors are represented by integers, with 0 likely being white, 2 being red, and 8 introduced in output which likely being azure. The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The core pattern seems to revolve around replicating and potentially mirroring or rotating elements of the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
