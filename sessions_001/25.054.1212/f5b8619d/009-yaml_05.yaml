facts:
  - observation: |
      Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - object: input_pixel
    properties:
      color: Any color (0-9)
      location: (row, col) in input_grid
    transformation: |
      Becomes the top-left pixel of a 2x2 block in the output grid.
  - object: output_block
    properties:
      size: 2x2
      location: (2 * input_row, 2 * input_col)  # Top-left corner
      top_left: Same color as corresponding input_pixel
      other_pixels: Azure (8)
  - rule: |
      The output grid is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
  - rule: |
      Azure (8) fills all positions not occupied by the original colors in the 2x2 blocks.
