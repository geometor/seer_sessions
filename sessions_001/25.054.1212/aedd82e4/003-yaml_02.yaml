observations:
  - object: red_pixel_group
    description: One or more contiguous red pixels.
    properties:
      - shape: variable
      - connectivity: horizontally or vertically adjacent
  - action: color_change
    description: A specific red pixel within the group changes to blue.
    target:
      - description: The bottom-rightmost red pixel of a group of three adjacent pixels, or the rightmost of two adjacent red pixels, or two adjacent red pixels.
        constraints:
          - "If there are two or three contiguous red pixels, the right-most of the contigous block becomes blue."
          - "If multiple contigous blocks exist, the lowest block takes precedence, if on the same row, right side takes precedent."
          - "If a contiguous red area is on a diagonal, the right-most red becomes blue, then the bottom-most red becomes blue."
