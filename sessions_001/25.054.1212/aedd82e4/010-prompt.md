Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import Tuple, List, Dict

def analyze_transformation(input_grid: np.ndarray, expected_output: np.ndarray, transformed_output: np.ndarray) -> Dict:
    """
    Analyzes the transformation results, providing detailed metrics and comparisons.

    Args:
        input_grid: The original input grid.
        expected_output: The expected output grid.
        transformed_output: The actual output grid produced by the transformation function.

    Returns:
        A dictionary containing analysis results, including:
        - match (bool): Whether the transformed output matches the expected output.
        - pixels_off (int): The number of pixels that differ between the expected and transformed outputs.
        - size_correct (bool): Whether the input and output grids have the same dimensions.
        - color_palette_correct (bool): Whether the transformed output uses only colors present in the input.
        - correct_pixel_counts (bool): correct pixel counts of each color
    """

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

Input:
```
None
```
Expected Output:
```
None
```
match: None
pixels_off: None
size_correct: None
color_palette_correct: None
correct_pixel_counts: None

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
