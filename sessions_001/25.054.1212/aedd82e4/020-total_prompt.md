## Example 4

**input:**
```
2 2 0
2 0 2
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A626B0>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
2 0 1
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47500880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. The cells within the grids contain single-digit integers, representing different colors. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), white (0), and blue (1). The transformation appears to involve a color change, specifically some white (0) cells changing to blue (1).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: cells
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)

actions:
  - name: color_change
    input_color: 0 #white
    output_color: 1 #blue
    conditions:
        - location: specific cells

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: cells are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Cells:** Locate the white (0) cells in the bottom right 2x2 subgrid of the input.
2.  **Conditional Color Change:** Change the color of these identified white (0) cells to blue (1).
3.   Leave all other cells at original input value.

In simpler terms, the transformation replaces the white cells in the bottom-right corner with blue cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
