The primary colors involved are red (2) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a very specific, localized change: a single red (2) pixel changes to blue (1). The location of this change appears to be related to the position of other red pixels. Specifically it is in the lower right of a set of four 2s in a square.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
