            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to address the discrepancies observed in the training examples.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code (which isn't provided, but its effects are shown through `analyze_example`) seems to be making incorrect transformations. The `analyze_example` function helps by comparing the transformed output with the expected output, highlighting differences in pixel counts, size, color palette, and overall pixel accuracy. The consistent errors across multiple examples indicate a fundamental flaw in the underlying transformation logic. The core issue seems to be an incorrect identification or handling of a specific color or object within the grid. Since all tests are failing the same way it is likely that a simple rule is being missed.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on consistent errors:** Identify patterns in the errors. Are the same colors being mis-transformed? Are the errors localized to specific regions of the grid?\n2.  **Re-examine the examples:** Visually inspect the input and expected output grids side-by-side to manually trace the intended transformation. This manual process will help pinpoint the precise rule being applied.\n3.  **Hypothesize and test:** Based on the visual inspection and error analysis, formulate a revised hypothesis about the transformation rule.\n4.  **Iterate:** Adjust the natural language program and subsequently the python code based on the new hypothesis and repeat testing.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis (via `analyze_example` output):**\n\nLet's break down the `analyze_example` output for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 1\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: True\n    *   *Observation:* A single pixel is incorrect. The size and overall color usage (counts of each color) is the same between predicted and expected, but a single red pixel is turning into something else.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: True\n    *   *Observation:* Two pixels are incorrect, but the size and used colors are the same.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: True\n    *   *Observation:* Two pixels are off, but size and colors used are correct.\n\n*    **Example 4:**\n    *   Pixels Off: 2\n    *   Size Correct: True\n    *   Color Palette Correct: True\n    *   Correct Pixel Counts: True\n    *   *Observation:* Two pixels off, sizes and used colors are correct.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  -

It's likely that the original, incorrect program was missing the \"directly to its left\" condition, perhaps changing *any* red pixel to blue, or changing based on incorrect adjacency.\n"
