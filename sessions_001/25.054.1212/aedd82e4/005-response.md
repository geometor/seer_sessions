Okay, here's a breakdown of the results, an assessment, and the requested deliverables.

**General Assessment:**

The code does a decent job of identifying contiguous red pixels and applying some rules, but it's not completely accurate, especially with diagonal groups. Example 3 and 4 show mismatches, and example 4 showing an error in identifying and changing a diagonal. The current logic seems too focused on identifying groups of specific sizes (2 or 3) and prioritizing the bottom-rightmost pixel, it must identify diagonal groups and select two pixels (the bottom and the right) to change.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Diagonal Group Handling:** The `select_target_pixel` function needs to be improved in determining bottom and right-most pixel.
2.  **Address Edge Cases:** Consider if any special handling is needed for edge cases where red groups are at the boundaries of the grid.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here is an assessment of each training example, focusing on where the mismatches occur, along with inferred rules.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Red Groups: Two groups: `[(0, 1), (0, 2)]` and `[(1, 1), (1, 2)],[(2, 0)]`
    *   Expected Change: one pixel in a group of 2 changes to blue, a single red pixel does not change.
    *   Observed Change: Correct
    *   Inferred Rule: In a group of two red, change the right-most to blue, a group of one is ignored.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 4x4
    *   Red Groups: Three groups: `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)], [(1,1)], [(2, 3)], [(3,1)]`
    *   Expected Change: Two single red pixels become blue.
    *   Observed Change: Correct
    *   Inferred Rule: When red pixels are alone, they become blue.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x4
    *   Red Groups: Three groups: `[(0, 0), (0, 1)], [(1, 1)], [(2, 0), (2, 1)], [(2, 3)], [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4,3)]`
    *   Expected Change: Rightmost pixel of the groups of 2 changes to blue, and the rightmost of the group of 3 changes to blue.
    *   Observed Change: Incorrect. It changes the last group of 3 correctly, but also an extra pixel.
    *   Inferred Rule (Adjustment): Groups of two red pixels: change the right-most to blue. A group of three: change the right-most to blue.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Red Groups: One: `[(0,0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1)]`
    *   Expected Change: two pixels turn blue.
    *   Observed Change: Incorrect. It changes a non-diagonal group member as well.
    *   Inferred Rule (Adjustment): If the red group is on a diagonal, change the bottom-most and the right-most to blue.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_group
    description: A contiguous group of red pixels.
    properties:
      - size: The number of pixels in the group.
      - shape: the layout of the pixels (e.g., horizontal, vertical, diagonal, other).
      - bottom_rightmost: The pixel in the group with the largest row and column indices.
      - bottom_most: The pixel in the group with the largest row.
      - right_most: The pixel in the group with the largest column.
actions:
  - name: change_color
    description: Change the color of a pixel.
    parameters:
      - from_color: The original color of the pixel (red).
      - to_color: The new color of the pixel (blue).
    conditions:
      - "if red_group.size == 1: change the single pixel"
      - "if red_group.size == 2: change the right_most pixel."
      - "if red_group.size == 3: change the right_most pixel"
      - "if red_group.shape == diagonal: change the right_most pixel and bottom_most pixel."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Groups:** Find all contiguous groups of red pixels. Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Categorize Group:** Determine the size and shape of each group.
3.  **Apply Transformation Rules:**
    *   If a red group contains only one pixel, change it to blue.
    *   If a red group contains two pixels, change the right-most pixel to blue.
    *   If a red group contains three pixels, change the right-most pixel to blue.
    *   If the red group is diagonal, change the bottom-most and right-most pixels to blue.
    *   All other red group pixels remain red.
4. All other pixels maintain color.
