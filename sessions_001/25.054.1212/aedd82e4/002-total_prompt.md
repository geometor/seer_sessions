## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 2 2
0 2 2
2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475001F0>

**output:**
```
0 2 2
0 2 2
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475031C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a structured report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and 2 (red). The output grid is identical to the input grid, except the pixel in the bottom-left corner, which changes from 2 (red) to 1 (blue)

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains colors 0 (white) and 2 (red).
  - observation: |
     The input grid contains one object, a contiguous region of red (2).
  - observation: |
      The output grid is almost identical to the input grid.
  - observation: |
     The bottom left corner value is 2 in the input, 1 in the output
  - action: |
      The color of the pixel at position (2,0) changes from 2 (red) to 1 (blue).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2.  Change the color of the pixel at the bottom-left corner (coordinates (2, 0)) from red (2) to blue (1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
