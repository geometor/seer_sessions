facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid has a diagonal line of colored pixels: azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4), moving from top-right to bottom-left. The rest of the pixels are black (0).
  - object_identification: |
      The primary objects are individual pixels, identifiable by their color (integer value).
  - input_pattern: |
       The input contains contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color arranged diagonally.
  - spatial_relationship: |
      The colored pixels in the input are diagonally adjacent. Black pixels surround the diagonal.
  - output_pattern: |
      The output grid is completely filled with a repeating three-color sequence: yellow(4), azure(8), green(3). These colors appear in the original image and repeat horizontally and vertically in the output
  - transformation_type: Pattern replacement/replication
  - dimensions: Input dimensions are 7x7. Output dimensions are 7x7.
