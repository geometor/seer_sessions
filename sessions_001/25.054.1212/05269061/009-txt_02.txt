# Conceptual Code Execution Results (for each example)

## Example 1:
Input Objects:
  - Object 1: [2, 8, 3] at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)
  - Object 2: [8, 3] at (1,0), (1,1)
  - Object 3: [3] at (2,0)

Output Objects:
   -Object 1: [2, 8, 3] at (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) and many others repeating
   -Object 2: [8, 3] at (1,0), (1,1)
   -Object 3: [3] at (2,0)

Transformation Analysis:
    - Non-zero pixel preservation:  Perfect
    - Zero-fill rule: The pattern of the objects is repeated in every direction

## Example 2:
Input Objects:
  - Object 1: [1] at (2,6)
  - Object 2: [1, 2] at (3, 5), (3, 6)
  - Object 3: [1, 2, 4] at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)
  ...

Output Objects:
  - Object 1: [1]
  - Object 2: [1, 2]
  - Object 3: [1, 2, 4]
 ...

Transformation Analysis:
    - Non-zero pixel preservation: Perfect.
    - Zero-fill rule: The patterns repeats.

## Example 3:
Input Objects:
  - Object 1: [8, 3] at (0, 4), (0,5)
  - Object 2: [8, 3]
 ...

Output Objects:
   - Object 1: [8,3]
  - Object 2: [8, 3]
 ...

Transformation Analysis:
    - Non-zero pixel preservation: Perfect.
    - Zero-fill rule: The pattern repeats
