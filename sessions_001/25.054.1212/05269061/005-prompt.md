Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Repeating Pattern:** Examine the input grid to find the smallest square block of pixels that, when mirrored both horizontally and vertically, can generate the entire output grid. This block may not always be in the top-left corner and might not be immediately obvious by looking at the bounds of non-zero pixels.
2.  **Determine Core Pattern Size:** The dimensions of the repeating square block identified in Step 1 constitute the core pattern's size.
3.  **Mirror and Replicate:** Create the output grid by replicating the core pattern.  For each cell in the output grid:
    *   Calculate the corresponding row and column indices within the core pattern using the modulo operator (`%`) with the core pattern size.
    *   Determine if the current output cell falls within a mirrored section.  Divide the output row and column indices by the core pattern size (integer division). If the result is odd, the corresponding dimension (row or column) is mirrored.
    *   If a dimension is mirrored, invert the core pattern index for that dimension by subtracting it from the core pattern size minus 1.
    *   Copy the pixel value from the calculated core pattern indices to the output grid cell.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
