facts:
  - observation: "Input grid contains a 7x7 matrix of pixels."
  - observation: "Output grid contains a 7x7 matrix of pixels."
  - observation: "Input grid has a 3x3 block of non-zero pixels in the top-left corner, rest are zero."
  - observation: "Non-zero pixel values are 2, 8, and 3."
  - observation: "Output grid is filled completely with 2, 8, and 3."
  - relationship: "Output pattern is an expansion of the input's non-zero region."
  - action: "Input pattern is repeated and mirrored to fill output."
  - property: "The input pattern has a width and height, which are the same as the output grid, giving the dimensions."
  - property_input_object: '`input_object` is a 2-d list of integers representing the color of each cell'
  - property_output_object: '`output_object` is a 2-d list of integers representing the color of each cell'
