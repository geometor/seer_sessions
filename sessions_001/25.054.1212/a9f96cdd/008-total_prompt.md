## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7BFC4754AA10>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7BFC4754B400>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are of the same dimensions (3x5 in this example).  The grids contain single-digit integer values, representing colors. The primary change observed is the movement and color change of a single non-zero pixel. Specifically, a red pixel (value 2) in the input becomes a green pixel (value 3) in the output, and its position shifts.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains a single red pixel (value 2) at coordinates (2, 4).
      The rest of the input is white (value 0)
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains a single green pixel (value 3) at coordinates (1, 3).
      The rest of the output is white (value 0)
  - action: |
      A single pixel changes its color and position between the input and output.
  - property_change: |
      The pixel's color changes from red (2) to green (3).
  - movement: |
      The pixel moves diagonally up and to the left.
  - coordinates:
    input_pixel: [2, 4]
    output_pixel: [1, 3]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-zero pixel:** Locate the single pixel in the input grid that has a value other than 0. In this case it's value 2.
2.  **Change Color:** change the value of the pixel 2 to 3.
3.  **Move Pixel:** Move the now green pixel (value 3) one position diagonally up and to the left.
4.  **Clear the original:** The original position is set to 0
5.  **Create Output:** Construct the output grid with the moved and recolored pixel, and all other cells set to 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
