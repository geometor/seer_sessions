## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x64 at 0x7BFC47500D30>

**output:**
```
1 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC47501090>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input is a single horizontal line, and the output is a rectangle. The colors involved are blue (1) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve expanding the blue region downwards and to the right.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input is a 1x6 grid."
  - observation: "Output is a 3x6 grid."
  - objects:
      - name: "Blue Region"
        initial_state: "Two adjacent blue pixels (value 1) on the left."
        final_state: "A 3x4 rectangle of blue pixels in the top-left."
      - name: "White Region"
        initial_state: "Four adjacent white pixels (value 0) on the right."
        final_state: "A 3x2 rectangle of white pixels in the top-right."
  - actions:
    - type: "Expansion"
      target: "Blue Region"
      description: "Expands downwards and to the right."
  - relationships:
      - type: "Adjacent"
        description: "Blue and White regions are adjacent horizontally in both input and output."
      - type: "Shape Change"
        from: "Blue Region (1x2)"
        to: "Blue Region (3x4)"
      - type: "Shape Change"
        from: "White Region (1x4)"
        to: "White Region(3x2)"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate the contiguous regions of blue (1) and white (0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Expand Blue Region:** The length of the blue region expands. Create copies of blue object below, and copies of new blue objects to their right. Stop once there are three rows.
3. **Maintain White regions** The white regions are maintained.
4.  **Output Grid:** Assemble the expanded blue region and the white region to form the output grid.

In simpler terms, the blue region grows into a rectangle by expanding downwards. The number of rows in the output is always three. The columns that are of color blue increase, but columns that are of color white remain the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
