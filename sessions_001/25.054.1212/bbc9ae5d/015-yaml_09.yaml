task: 014
objects:
  - id: input_row
    type: grid
    description: A 1xN grid representing the initial state.
    properties:
      - cells: Contains values from 0-9, representing colors.
      - non_zero_cells: Cells with values other than 0. These are the 'source' of the expansion.
      - zero_cells: Cells with value 0.  These are copied directly to the output.

  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: An MxN grid representing the transformed state.
    properties:
      - height:  Determined by the total number of non-zero values in the input row.
      - width: The same as the input row.
      - expanded_squares: Regions of non-zero color originating from the non-zero cells in the input row.  These are not always perfect squares.
      - zero_regions: Regions of color 0, directly copied from the corresponding position in the input row.

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Non-zero values in the input row are expanded into "squares" in the output grid.  The height is determined by the number of non-zero elements.
    agent: non_zero_cells
    parameters:
      - height: number of non zero colors in the input row
      - start_width: 1, end_width: height
      - color:  The value of the non-zero cell in the input row.

  - name: copy
    description: Zero values in the input row are copied to all corresponding columns in the output grid.
    agent: zero_cells
