The input is a single row (1x6 grid), and the output is a rectangular grid (3x6 grid). The values '8' (azure) and '0' (white) are present in both input and output. The number of '8's increases, and the number of '0's decreases. The transformation appears to be an expansion or replication of the input row, but with a change in some of the azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
