            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the derived code were too simplistic. It correctly identified the sequence of non-zero pixels and the trailing zeros. However, it failed to correctly *extend* the sequence in each subsequent output row. The code copies parts of input, but does it incorrectly. Specifically the error appears to be how the colors repeat and how many rows get output. It also is not clear that the program should only expect one row as input.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Clarify Input:** Explicitly state the input is a single row. While this seems obvious from the examples, it's good to state it.\n2.  **Correct Row Generation**: The number of output rows appears related to the number of non-zero colors in the input row before trailing 0's appear, *or* the output extends by one row until the repeated colors fill a row of the same width.\n3.  **Correct Extension Logic:** The core issue is that the copied section is not extended. We will ensure that each subsequent row extends the non-zero sequence correctly, repeating the last color in each row.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 022\ninput_type: single row grid\noutput_type: multiple row grid\ntransformation_type: sequence extension\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_width: 6\n      non_zero_count: 2\n      expected_output_rows: 3\n      actual_output_rows: 2\n      extension_correct: False\n  - example_2:\n      input_width: 8\n      non_zero_count: 1\n      expected_output_rows: 3\n      actual_output_rows: 1\n      extension_correct: False\n  - example_3:\n      input_width: 10\n      non_zero_count: 3\n      expected_output_rows: 6\n      actual_output_rows: 3\n      extension_correct: False\n  - example_4:\n      input_width: 6\n      non_zero_count: 4\n      expected_output_rows: 3\n      actual_output_rows: 4\n      extension_correct: False\n  - example_5:\n      input_width: 6\n      non_zero_count: 1\n      expected_output_rows: 3\n      actual_output_rows: 1\n      extension_correct: False\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** The input is a single-row grid.\n2.  **Identify Non-Zero Sequence:** Determine the sequence of non-zero colored pixels at the beginning of the input row. Also note the sequence of trailing zero-colored pixels.\n3.  **Determine Number of output rows.** Determine the length of the full input. Also determine the number of output rows based on the non zero sequence. Output rows continue until the non-zero sequence fills the output row width.\n4.  **Create Output Rows:** Create a series of output rows.\n5.  **Extend Sequence:**\n    *   The first output row is a copy of the input row.\n    *   For each subsequent output row:\n        *   Copy the previous row\n        *   Find the position of the first zero after the intial non-zero sequence. Change it to be the same color as the preceding pixel.\n6. Stop when output row is entirely non-zero colors.\n\n"
