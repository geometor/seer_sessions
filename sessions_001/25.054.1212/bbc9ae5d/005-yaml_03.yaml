observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 1 x variable
      - contains: single row of pixels, some colored, some white

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable x variable
      - relationship_to_input:
        - rows: input_rows + count_of_non_white_pixels
        - cols: same as input
        - color:  non-white pixels from input are replicated in a triangle shape
      - contains: expanding color and white background

  - action: expansion
    description: The non-white color in the input grid expands into a triangle-like shape in the output grid.
    details:
      - shape:  The number of pixels of the non-white color in the input determines additional rows of output.  The shape formed is triangular.
      - background: Remaining pixels are filled with white.
