  - description: "The output consists of multiple rows, increasing in length."
    type: "output_structure"
  - description: "Each output row extends the sequence of non-zero colors from the input."
    type: "transformation_rule"
    details: "The non-zero color sequence in each subsequent row is one pixel longer than the previous row, up until the last non zero pixel."
  - description: "Trailing zeros from the input are preserved in each output row."
    type: "transformation_rule"
    details: "The zeros at the end of the input row maintain original length in the output."
