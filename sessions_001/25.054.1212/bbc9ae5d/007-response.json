The input grid contains a single colored pixel (red, represented by the value '2') at the beginning, followed by multiple white pixels (value '0'). The output grid expands vertically, replicating the initial red pixel downwards and to the right, forming a diagonal pattern, while the rest of the grid remains white. The number of rows in output seem to be related with number of red boxes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify the color and position of the non-zero pixel (in this case, a red pixel at the beginning). Count how many times red appears in the row.\n2.  **Output Grid Creation:** Create a new output grid. The number of rows in output grid equals to number of times red appears, and The number of columns in the output grid is the same as in the input grid.\n3.  **Diagonal Replication:** Replicate the red pixel diagonally downwards and to the right. Start with original position. Copy red color to the cell in next row, and the next column. Repeat until the row reaches the height of output grid.\n4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with white pixels (value 0).\n"
