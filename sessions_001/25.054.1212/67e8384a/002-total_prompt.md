## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 3 4
3 4 5
3 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475021D0>

**output:**
```
5 3 4 4 3 5
3 4 5 5 4 3
3 4 4 4 4 3
3 4 4 4 4 3
3 4 5 5 4 3
5 3 4 4 3 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be replicated and potentially mirrored to form the output grid. The colors/values within the input grid are preserved in the output grid. The dimensions of the input grid are 3x3, and the output grid is 6x6, suggesting a doubling in both dimensions.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - subject: input_grid
    description: original grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers representing colors
  - subject: output_grid
    description: transformed grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 6x6
      elements: integers representing colors, mirroring input_grid
  - relation: transformation
    description: input_grid is duplicated and mirrored to form output_grid
    properties:
        dimension_change: input dimensions are doubled
        pattern: replication and mirroring

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replicate:** The input grid is replicated four times.
2.  **Mirroring/Placement**:
    *   The original input grid is placed in the top-left quadrant of the output grid.
    *   A horizontally mirrored copy of the input grid is placed in the top-right quadrant.
    *   A vertically mirrored copy of the input grid is placed in the bottom-left quadrant.
    *   A diagonally mirrored copy (or both horizontal and vertical mirroring) of the input grid is placed in the bottom-right quadrant.

In essence, the transformation creates a 2x2 grid where each cell is a copy of the input, and these copies is either the original, or one of its mirror images. The type of mirroring is determined by the relative location within the bigger picture:
- top-left: original
- top-right: horizontal flip
- bottom-left: vertical flip
- bottom-right: both flips (horizontal+vertical, which is same as rotating 180 degrees)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
