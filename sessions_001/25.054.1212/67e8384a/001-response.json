The input grid appears to be replicated and potentially mirrored to form the output grid. The colors/values within the input grid are preserved in the output grid. The dimensions of the input grid are 3x3, and the output grid is 6x6, suggesting a doubling in both dimensions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The type of mirroring is determined by the relative location within the bigger picture:\n- top-left: original\n- top-right: horizontal flip\n- bottom-left: vertical flip\n- bottom-right: both flips (horizontal+vertical, which is same as rotating 180 degrees)\n"
