            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to extract a 2x2 square of yellow pixels. This worked correctly for Example 2, but failed for Examples 1 and 3. The failures are due to the `transform` function returning `None` because it couldn't find a 2x2 yellow square, as it specifically looked for color 4.  The core issue is that the code is too specific (looking for yellow) when it should generalize to *any* 2x2 square of a single color, and then replicate that 2x2 square in the output.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Modify `find_object`:** It should detect *any* 2x2 square of a single color, not just yellow.\n2.  **Modify `transform`:** The `transform` function needs to be updated to reflect the updated logic of `find_object`. It should extract any, rather that a specific, 2x2 colored square.\n3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** No changes necessary, as original prompt specified the existance of at least one such object.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Contains a 2x2 square of magenta pixels (color 6).\n    *   Expected Output: The 2x2 magenta square.\n    *   Actual Output: `None` (failure to find a *yellow* 2x2 square).\n    *   Problem:  The code only looks for yellow (color 4) squares.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Contains a 2x2 square of yellow pixels (color 4).\n    *   Expected Output: The 2x2 yellow square.\n    *   Actual Output: The 2x2 yellow square (correct).\n    *   Success: The code correctly identified and extracted the yellow square.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Contains a 2x2 square of grey (color 5) pixels at `[2,5]`, and another at the bounds of `[3,5]` and `[2,6]`. The object spans multiple rows and columns, so it's vital to return the correct bounds.\n    *   Expected Output: The 2x2 sub-grid bounded by these coordinates.\n    *   Actual Output: `None` (failure to find a *yellow* 2x2 square).\n    *   Problem: The code only looks for yellow (color 4) squares.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: 2x2 square\n    description: A contiguous block of 2x2 pixels, all of the same color.\n    input_instances:\n      - example_1:\n          color: 6  # Magenta\n          location: (6, 3) #row, col\n      - example_2:\n          color: 4  # Yellow\n          location: (1, 2)\n      - example_3:\n          color: 5 #grey\n          location: (2,5)\n    transformation:\n      - type: extract\n        description: The 2x2 square is extracted from the input grid and becomes the output grid.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find a 2x2 Square:** Scan the input grid to identify any 2x2 square region where all four pixels have the same color (regardless of the specific color).\n2.  **Extract the Square:** Once a 2x2 square is found, extract it from the input grid.\n3.  **Output:** The extracted 2x2 square is the output grid.\n"
