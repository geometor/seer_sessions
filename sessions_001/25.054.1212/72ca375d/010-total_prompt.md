Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to extract a 2x2 square of yellow pixels. This worked correctly for Example 2, but failed for Examples 1 and 3. The failures are due to the `transform` function returning `None` because it couldn't find a 2x2 yellow square, as it specifically looked for color 4.  The core issue is that the code is too specific (looking for yellow) when it should generalize to *any* 2x2 square of a single color, and then replicate that 2x2 square in the output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Modify `find_object`:** It should detect *any* 2x2 square of a single color, not just yellow.
2.  **Modify `transform`:** The `transform` function needs to be updated to reflect the updated logic of `find_object`. It should extract any, rather that a specific, 2x2 colored square.
3.  **Handle Edge Cases:** No changes necessary, as original prompt specified the existance of at least one such object.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Contains a 2x2 square of magenta pixels (color 6).
    *   Expected Output: The 2x2 magenta square.
    *   Actual Output: `None` (failure to find a *yellow* 2x2 square).
    *   Problem:  The code only looks for yellow (color 4) squares.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Contains a 2x2 square of yellow pixels (color 4).
    *   Expected Output: The 2x2 yellow square.
    *   Actual Output: The 2x2 yellow square (correct).
    *   Success: The code correctly identified and extracted the yellow square.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Contains a 2x2 square of grey (color 5) pixels at `[2,5]`, and another at the bounds of `[3,5]` and `[2,6]`. The object spans multiple rows and columns, so it's vital to return the correct bounds.
    *   Expected Output: The 2x2 sub-grid bounded by these coordinates.
    *   Actual Output: `None` (failure to find a *yellow* 2x2 square).
    *   Problem: The code only looks for yellow (color 4) squares.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: 2x2 square
    description: A contiguous block of 2x2 pixels, all of the same color.
    input_instances:
      - example_1:
          color: 6  # Magenta
          location: (6, 3) #row, col
      - example_2:
          color: 4  # Yellow
          location: (1, 2)
      - example_3:
          color: 5 #grey
          location: (2,5)
    transformation:
      - type: extract
        description: The 2x2 square is extracted from the input grid and becomes the output grid.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find a 2x2 Square:** Scan the input grid to identify any 2x2 square region where all four pixels have the same color (regardless of the specific color).
2.  **Extract the Square:** Once a 2x2 square is found, extract it from the input grid.
3.  **Output:** The extracted 2x2 square is the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
