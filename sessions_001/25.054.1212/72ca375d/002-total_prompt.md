## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 2 0 0 7 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7BFC4890A380>

**output:**
```
6 6 6 6
0 6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x128 at 0x7BFC48908D00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid seems to be a selective extraction or summary of a specific color region from the input grid. Specifically, the magenta (6) region in the input is isolated in the output. The output grid's dimensions correspond to the bounding box of just the magenta shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10x10, 2x4] #input, output
      elements: integers (0-9)
      element_meaning: color_codes

  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: magenta (6)
      bounding_box_input:  [ (7,3), (8,6) ] # top-left row,col, bottom-right row, col
      bounding_box_output: [ (0,0), (1,3) ]

actions:
  - type: extract
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
       color: 6
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: shape
  - type: corresponds_to
    from: shape
    to: output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Color:** The program focuses on a single color within the input grid, in this instance magenta (represented by the digit 6).
2.  **Locate the Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular area that encloses all pixels of the target color (magenta) in the input grid. Note the row and column of the upper-left and lower right pixels.
3. **Extract the area:** Create the ouput grid that represents a cropped view of the input grid, using the coordinates of the bounding box identified in step 2, filled with the pixels of the target color.

In summary, the transformation isolates a specific colored shape (magenta in this instance) from the input grid and presents it as a separate, smaller grid, effectively cropping to the bounding box of the target color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
