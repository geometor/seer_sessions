            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too simplistic. It correctly identified the need for a 2x2 square but made an incorrect assumption. it seems to return an empty 2x2 square instead of the found square. The core issue is that while the `find_2x2_square` function *locates* a 2x2 square, it returns the starting coordinate of the first black region, it does not necessarily find a 2x2 of a *non-zero* color. The examples demonstrate that the 2x2 square of uniform color we're looking for isn't always at the \"top-left\" and can be of any non-zero color. The program needs to find and *return* the correct 2x2 square.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Improve `find_2x2_square`:**  The function should continue searching until it finds a 2x2 square of a *non-zero* color. The current version stops at the first matching 2x2 pattern, even if the values are zero.\n2.  **Correctly extract the square in `transform`:** the function does not appear to properly extract the 2x2 square.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nI'll use a structured format to represent the facts, then formulate the natural language program.\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - object_id: square1\n        type: square\n        size: 2x2\n        color: 2 #red\n        position: (1,1) # top-left corner of the square\n      - object_id: square2 #orange\n        type: square\n        size: 2x2\n        color: 6 #magenta\n        position: (6,3)\n    output_objects:\n      - object_id: out_square2\n        type: square\n        size: 2x2\n        color: 6 #magenta\n        position: (0,0) # output is *just* the square\n    transformation:\n      description: \"Find the second non-black 2x2 square in the image, starting the search from top to bottom, left to right.

At each position, check if a 2x2 square can be formed starting from that position (i.e., we have at least one row below and one column to the right).\n3.  If a 2x2 square *can* be formed, check if all four pixels in the potential 2x2 square have the *same* color.\n4.  If the colors are the same, and it is *not* black (color 0), return the 2x2 square.\n5. In some case, the region may not be a 2x2 square - find the region and return it.\n\nEssentially: \"Find the first 2x2 square region of uniform, non-zero color within the input grid. Return this 2x2 square as the output grid.\" Or, \"Scan the image for a non-black 2x2 square. If found, return the 2x2 square region.\"\n"
