The input grid contains various colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to focus on a specific color (in this case, 5, representing gray) and its arrangement. The output grid's dimensions are significantly smaller than the input. It appears the transformation involves extracting, simplifying, or summarizing specific features from the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
