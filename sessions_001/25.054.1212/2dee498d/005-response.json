The core issue is that the code expects 'output\\_grid' as a parameter, which causes errors when it's not designed to receive it that way. It seems the original code attempted to use the output grid's dimensions to define how to extract a part of input, but made mistake on how to do it. Instead, based on the new data, the output grid is the left upper corner of the input grid. The strategy should shift towards correctly identifying and applying selection rules.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of each example, including a more precise description of the results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 9)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Result: `TypeError` due to the function expecting `output_grid` as a parameter. The previous solution selected the center subgrid, not the left upper corner.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 12)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Result: `TypeError` for same reason. The previous solution selected the center subgrid, not the left upper corner.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Result: `TypeError` for same reason. The previous solution selected the center subgrid, not the left upper corner.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: [3, 9]\n      output_shape: [3, 3]\n      objects:\n        - description: input grid\n          type: grid\n          properties:\n            shape: [3, 9]\n        - description: output grid\n          type: grid\n          properties:\n            shape: [3, 3]\n      transformation:\n        type: subgrid extraction\n        location: upper-left corner\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: [4, 12]\n      output_shape: [4, 4]\n      objects:\n       - description: input grid\n         type: grid\n         properties:\n           shape: [4, 12]\n       - description: output grid\n         type: grid\n         properties:\n           shape: [4, 4]\n      transformation:\n        type: subgrid extraction\n        location: upper-left corner\n  - example_3:\n      input_shape: [2, 6]\n      output_shape: [2, 2]\n      objects:\n        - description: input grid\n          type: grid\n          properties:\n            shape: [2, 6]\n        - description: output grid\n          type: grid\n          properties:\n            shape: [2, 2]\n      transformation:\n        type: subgrid extraction\n        location: upper-left corner\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Input and Output Dimensions:** Determine the number of rows and columns in the output grid.\n2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a subgrid from the input grid. The subgrid's dimensions are identical to those of the desired output grid. The subgrid is taken from the upper-left corner of the input grid, starting at row 0, column 0.\n3. **Return the Subgrid:** The extracted subgrid IS the output. No changes of any kind are applied.\n\n"
