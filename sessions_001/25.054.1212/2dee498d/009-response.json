            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to extract a 4x4 subgrid. This works correctly only when the input grid is at least 4x4. Example 2, which is larger, is processed correctly, demonstrating the core logic is sound when size constraints are met. However, Examples 1 and 3, being smaller than 4x4 in either dimension, cause \"index out of bounds\" errors. The strategy must shift from always taking a 4x4 block to taking a block *up to* 4x4, bounded by the input dimensions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core concept of extracting a top-left subgrid is correct. The issue is the assumption of a fixed 4x4 size. We need to modify the code to dynamically determine the size of the subgrid based on the input grid's dimensions, taking the smaller of the input dimension or 4.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 3x9\n    *   Expected Output Size: 3x3\n    *   Result: Error (index out of bounds)\n    *   Observation: The code tried to access row 4 (index 3), but the input only has 3 rows.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 4x12\n    *   Expected Output Size: 4x4\n    *   Result: Match\n    *   Observation: The code correctly extracted the 4x4 subgrid.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 2x6\n    *   Expected Output Size: 2x2\n    *   Result: Error (index out of bounds)\n    *   Observation: The code tried to access row 3 and 4 (with index 2 and 3) but only 2 exist.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - width: variable\n      - height: variable\n      - elements: integers (0-9)\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      - width: min(input_width, 4)\n      - height: min(input_height, 4)\n      - elements: integers (0-9)\nactions:\n  - name: extract_subgrid\n    input: input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n    description: Extracts a subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid.\n    constraints:\n      - output_grid width:  The smaller of the input grid width and 4.\n      - output_grid height: The smaller of the input grid height and 4.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   Find the width of the input grid.\n    *   Find the height of the input grid.\n    *   The output grid's width will be the smaller value between the input grid's width and 4.\n    *   The output grid's height will be the smaller value between the input grid's height and 4.\n2.  **Extract Subgrid:**\n    *   Iterate through the rows of the input grid, starting from the first row (row index 0) up to the calculated output grid's height.\n    *   For each row, extract elements starting from the first column (column index 0) up to the calculated output grid's width.\n    *   Append these extracted elements as a new row in the output grid.\n3. **Return Output:** The output is the extracted sub-grid.\n\nIn essence, the program extracts the top-left portion of the input grid. The size of this portion is determined by either the dimensions of the input grid itself or 4x4, whichever is smaller.\n"
