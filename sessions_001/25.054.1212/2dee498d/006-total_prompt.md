Previous Code:
```python
"""

"""

import numpy as np

def get_subgrid(grid, output_rows, output_cols):
    """Extracts a subgrid of specified dimensions."""
    center_row, center_col = grid.shape[0] // 2, grid.shape[1] // 2

Train Set Results:

```
Expected Output:
```
4 5 1
5 5 5
1 5 4
```
match: ERROR: transform() missing 1 required positional argument: 'output_grid'
pixels_off: None
size_correct: None

```

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was built on an assumption from the first training example, which evidently doesn't hold true across all examples. The core issue is that the code expects 'output\_grid' as a parameter, which causes errors when it's not designed to receive it that way. It seems the original code attempted to use the output grid's dimensions to define how to extract a part of input, but made mistake on how to do it. Instead, based on the new data, the output grid is the left upper corner of the input grid. The strategy should shift towards correctly identifying and applying selection rules.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a summary of each example, including a more precise description of the results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 9)
    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Result: `TypeError` due to the function expecting `output_grid` as a parameter. The previous solution selected the center subgrid, not the left upper corner.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (4, 12)
    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)
    *   Result: `TypeError` for same reason. The previous solution selected the center subgrid, not the left upper corner.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (2, 6)
    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Result: `TypeError` for same reason. The previous solution selected the center subgrid, not the left upper corner.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Input and Output Dimensions:** Determine the number of rows and columns in the output grid.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a subgrid from the input grid. The subgrid's dimensions are identical to those of the desired output grid. The subgrid is taken from the upper-left corner of the input grid, starting at row 0, column 0.
3. **Return the Subgrid:** The extracted subgrid IS the output. No changes of any kind are applied.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
