## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 5 1 1 5 4 4 5 1
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
1 5 4 4 5 1 1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x7BFC47547970>

**output:**
```
4 5 1
5 5 5
1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47546050>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, represented by single-digit integers. The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a reduction or extraction process. The colors are consistent between the input and output, meaning the transformation doesn't involve color changes. The spatial arrangement of the pixels is preserved, but some pixels are removed. The most prominent observation is that the output grid seems to represent a 3x3 "core" extracted from the center.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - elements: integers (representing colors)
    relationships:
      - input_grid: contains output_grid (as a sub-region)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
    relationships:
      - part_of: grid

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Selects a sub-region from the input grid.
    parameters:
      - region: central 3x3 area
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the center:** Determine the center coordinates of the input grid.
2.  **Extract 3x3 Region:** Create a new 3x3 grid by selecting pixels from the input grid. The central pixel is at row = 1 and col = 4. The selected pixels will include the center and the 3 x 3 box surrounding that pixel.
3. The output grid will then be the extracted region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
