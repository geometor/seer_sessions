observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: 3x3
      output_shape: 3x3
      transformations: |
        Elements of the last row shifted within the row.
        The '5's from the first column are used in the first row.

  - example_2:
      input_shape: 3x3
      output_shape: 3x3
      transformations: |
        The bottom left `5`s are replaced with the values above them, and the last element of the middle row is replaced by a `5` from the row below.

  - example_3:
      input_shape: 3x3
      output_shape: 3x3
      transformations: |
        The '5' at (1,0) is replaced by '9' at (0,0)

  - example_4:
      input_shape: 3x3
      output_shape: 3x3
      transformations: |
        First row rotates by 1 to the left, last two row's first and last elements are switched.

  - general:
      grid_size: constant
      colors: preserved, some relocated
      rows: Elements in rows change based on relative positioning.
      columns: No specific column operation is consistently applied, focus on row transformations
