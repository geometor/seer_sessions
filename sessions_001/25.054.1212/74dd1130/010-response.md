1. Sort Rows: For each row in the input grid, sort the elements (pixel values) in ascending order.
2. Transpose: Transpose the original input grid – that is, swap its rows and columns. The element at `input[i][j]` moves to `input[j][i]`.
3. Apply Sorted Rows: Construct the output by using the values obtained from sorted rows of the input grid, and arrange the sorted rows using the layout structure of the *transposed* input grid.
