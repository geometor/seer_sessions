## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A615A0>

**output:**
```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F932E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grids contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve some kind of rearrangement or rotation of the elements within the grid, rather than a change in the values themselves.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: input and output grids have the same dimensions
  - observation: values in the input grid are present in the output grid, but in different locations
  - hypothesis: transformation involves spatial rearrangement (e.g., rotation, reflection, swapping)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid.

1.  Consider the input grid.

2.  Imagine rotating the entire grid 90 degrees in a clockwise direction.

3.  The resulting arrangement of elements after the rotation is the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
