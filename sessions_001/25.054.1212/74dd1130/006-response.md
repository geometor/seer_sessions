1. Transpose: The input grid is transposed. This means the rows become columns, and the columns become rows.
2. Cyclic Shift: After transposition, each row of the *new* grid (which were originally columns) undergoes a cyclic right shift. This means each element in the row moves one position to the right, and the last element in the row wraps around to become the first element.
