## Example 4

**input:**
```
2 2 6
2 1 1
2 6 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48DA7D90>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
6 1 6
6 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A63B20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of some of these pixels. The blue (1) pixels remain unchanged, while there is interaction with the red (2) and magenta(6)

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        mapping:
          0: white
          1: blue
          2: red
          3: green
          4: yellow
          5: gray
          6: magenta
          7: orange
          8: azure
          9: maroon

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color_id: int  # 0-9
      position: (row, col) # 2D coordinates

actions:
- name: swap horizontal
  type: move
  parameters: object position
  description: exchange magenta(6) for a red(2) on either end of the grid based on row

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - type: position
    description: Each pixel has an absolute row/column index

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Stable Elements:** Locate all blue (1) pixels. Their positions in the output grid remain identical to their positions in the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal swap:** For each row, locate the magenta(6) cell and swap it's value with the red (2) value cell in that row that is on the opposite horizontal end of the grid.
    For example, if the magenta is at postion (0,2), swap with the red at postion (0,0)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
