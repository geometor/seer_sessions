In this example, the values in positions (0,1) and (1,0) are transposed. Specifically, value in position (0,1) with value `2` in the input is moved to (1,0) in the output and value `6` at postion (1,0) is moved to (0,1) in the output.\n4.  **Preserve**: All other cells retain their original values and positions, directly copied from the input grid to the corresponding location in the output grid.\n"
