  objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        rows: 3
        columns: 3
        elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    - type: row #each row is an object
      properties:
        elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
        length: 3
        index:  # 0, 1, or 2 within its parent grid

  actions:
    - description: "Each row of input can map to a row in the output"
    - description: "The counts of each color may change from input to output"

  observations:
    - "The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid."
    - "The colors used in output exist in the input"
    - example_1:
        row_mapping: "Row permutation, order changes"
    - example_2:
        row_mapping: "Row 1 is constant, other rows do not map consistently"
    - example_3:
        row_mapping: "Row 1 and 3 are constant, row 2 does not map"
    - example_4:
        row_mapping: "no consistent mapping"
