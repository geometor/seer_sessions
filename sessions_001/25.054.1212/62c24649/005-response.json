            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the errors, and an updated natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was on the right track, conceptually, with the idea of doubling and adding a border. However, it incorrectly calculated the output dimensions and applied the border and duplication logic. The output size is consistently wrong. The core issue is that the dimensions are being *more* than doubled, and border is being added inside the expanded grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Output Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions should be exactly twice the input grid's dimensions. No extra border space is needed.\n2.  **Accurate Pixel Duplication:** The current code attempts to duplicate pixels but overshoots and expands the grid at the same time. We must ensure each input pixel is correctly mapped to a 2x2 block in the output.\n3. **Eliminate Border Logic** - the border logic should be discarded, the output border is the filled 2x2 of the original input border.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution where needed):**\n\nI will create a table to structure the findings, then create a YAML block to describe object transformations and a final program.\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Expected Output Shape | Actual Output Shape | Size Correct? | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                        |\n| ------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (2, 3)      | (4, 6)                | (6,8)          | No            | Many        | Border incorrectly added, duplication overshoots                             |\n| 2       | (2, 3)      | (4, 6)                | (6,8)             | No            | Many        | Same as Example 1                                                            |\n| 3       | (2, 3)      | (4, 6)                | (6,8)              | No            | Many        | Same as Example 1                                                            |\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 004b3d53\nsummary: >\n    The input grid's pixels are each duplicated into 2x2 blocks of the\n    same color in the output grid. The output grid is exactly twice the\n    size of the input grid in each dimension.\nobjects:\n  - object_id: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      dimensions: (height, width)\n      pixels: 2D array of color values\n      border: edge values\n\n  - object_id: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    properties:\n      dimensions: (2 * input_height, 2 * input_width)\n      pixels: 2D array of color values, derived from input_grid\n\nactions:\n    - action_id: duplicate_pixel\n      input: input_grid pixel value\n      output: 2x2 block of the same color in the output_grid\n\ntransformations:\n    - Every pixel at (i, j) in the input_grid becomes a 2x2 block of pixels in the output_grid at locations (2i, 2j), (2i+1, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), and (2i+1, 2j+1), all with same color as input[i,j]\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's height and width are exactly twice the input grid's height and width, respectively.\n2.  **Pixel Duplication:** For every pixel in the input grid:\n    *   Take its color value.\n    *   Create a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid, all with the same color as the input pixel.\n    *   The top-left corner of this 2x2 block will be at the coordinates (2 \\* row, 2 \\* column) of the original input pixel.\n\nIn simpler terms, each pixel in the input \"explodes\" into a 2x2 square of the same color in the output. The output is a scaled-up version of the input, with each original pixel represented by a 2x2 block.\n"
