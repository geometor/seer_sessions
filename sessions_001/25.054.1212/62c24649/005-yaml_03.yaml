task: 004b3d53
summary: >
    The input grid's pixels are each duplicated into 2x2 blocks of the
    same color in the output grid. The output grid is exactly twice the
    size of the input grid in each dimension.
objects:
  - object_id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: (height, width)
      pixels: 2D array of color values
      border: edge values

  - object_id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: (2 * input_height, 2 * input_width)
      pixels: 2D array of color values, derived from input_grid

actions:
    - action_id: duplicate_pixel
      input: input_grid pixel value
      output: 2x2 block of the same color in the output_grid

transformations:
    - Every pixel at (i, j) in the input_grid becomes a 2x2 block of pixels in the output_grid at locations (2i, 2j), (2i+1, 2j), (2i, 2j+1), and (2i+1, 2j+1), all with same color as input[i,j]
