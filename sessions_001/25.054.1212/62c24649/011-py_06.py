                if i >= rows:
                    mirrored_i = 2 * rows - 1 - i
                if j >= cols:
                    mirrored_j = 2 * cols - 1- j
    ```
    I will rewrite this part.

2.  **Stepwise Refinement:** Instead of combining horizontal and vertical mirroring, I'll separate them in the natural language program first to make the logic clearer. This will help in debugging and understanding the transformations.

3.  **Focus on indexing**: Review the array indexing thoroughly.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of observations for each example:

*   **All Examples:**
    *   `size_correct`: True (The output grid dimensions are always double the input grid dimensions).
    *   `color_palette_correct`: True (Only colors present in the input grid appear in the output grid).
    *   `match`: False
    *   `pixels_off`: 24
    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False

*   **Example specific notes from visual inspection**:
    *Example 1:* It appears that only first scaling is correct. The mirroring does not perform as in description.
    *Example 2:* Again, the scaled image has not been mirrored correctly.
    *Example 3:* Same errors, scaling is partially correct, mirroring is wrong.
