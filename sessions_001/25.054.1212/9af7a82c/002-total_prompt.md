## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 3 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A60820>

**output:**
```
1 2 3
1 2 0
1 2 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7BFC4754B280>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid of colored numbers (input) into a larger grid of colored numbers (output). The colors in the input grid seem to dictate the structure and colors in the output grid. There's a clear relationship between the input grid's dimensions and the output grid's dimensions. Specifically the height of input is multiplied by a constant to make the height of the output, while the input's width is also multiplied by a constant to create the output width. The numbers/colors in the input seem to map to columns in the output, with '0' (white) appearing where a number is absent.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
      - observation: each cell's value corresponds to a color.

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x3
      - values: integers 0-9 (representing colors)
      - observation: dimensions are related to input grid dimensions; presence of '0' values.

  - type: transformation
    description: input to output
    properties:
      - relationship: input values seem to map to output columns.
      - observation: input dimensions * constant = output dims
      - observation: "height" seems like a more critical/driving attribute than "width"
      - observation: "0" (white color) is used as an empty cell

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** The output grid's height is determined based on how many rows containing a '1' value are present. That number of rows containing '1' + 2. Each row contains 1 value of '1'. The output grid's width is the same as the input's width.

2.  **Iterate through Input Grid:** For each column in the input grid, create a column of the output grid by duplicating the value the number of times as the number of rows.

3.  **Populate Output:**
    *   Iterate through each column from the input grid.
    *   For input grid columns: Create an output column where: The cells from top to bottom will contain a number from left to right of the input grid, and the rest will be filled with "0".
    *   Example input column `[2, 3, 1]` becomes output column `[1, 2, 3, 0, 0]`

In summary the transformation stacks the values from the input column into output column, and completes with white cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
