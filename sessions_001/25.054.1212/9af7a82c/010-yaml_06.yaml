  - task_id: "unknown"  # Replace with actual task ID if available
  - input_objects:
    - description: "2D grids of colored pixels"
    - properties:
      - colors: "Integers 0-9 representing different colors"
      - shape: "Variable, between 1x1 and 30x30"
  - output_objects:
    - description: "2D grids of colored pixels, derived from input grids"
    - properties:
      - colors: "Integers 0-9, including 0 (white) for padding"
      - shape: "Determined by the number of unique colors in the input, plus padding"
  - transformations:
    - type: "Color Reordering and Padding"
    - details:
      - "Input grid colors are sorted in descending order."
      - "Output grid is constructed with sorted colors forming initial rows."
      - "Rows of 0 (white) are added to the output to reach a specific height."
  - observations:
    - "Output height is consistently related to input: number of unique colors + padding"
    - output_width: Input unique pixel count
    - "The output grid always includes color 0, even if it's not in the input."
