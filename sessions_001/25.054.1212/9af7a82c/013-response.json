The input grid seems to be transformed into the output grid based on some rule involving the colors and positions of the pixels. It appears that columns are being reordered or replaced, and some are being set to zero (white). The specific colors in the input seem important for determining which color ends up where in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The columns containing colors '8' (azure) and '3'(green) are significant, and are maintained. The column that has '2' (red) moves to the last position, while the column that has yellow ('4') moves to the second to last.\n\n2.  **Column Reordering:**\n    *   The first and second column of the output grid are copies of the '3' and '8' columns in the original, respectively.\n    *   The third column of the output is a copy of the last input column which contains color `4`.\n    *   The fourth column of the output is copy of the first input column which has color `2`.\n\n3.  **Zeroing Out (Replacement):**\n    Any remaining columns that are lower in the y axis than a maintained element are set to '0' (white).\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves finding the positions of colors '3','8','4' and '2' in the input, preserving those, reordering the '4' and'2' columns, and setting cells to zero (white) below maintained elements.\n"
