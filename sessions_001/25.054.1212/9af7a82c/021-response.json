            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was overly specific to the dimensions and values of the first training example. It correctly identified a pattern of copying the first two columns and modifying the third. It recognized the increase in the number of rows, but hard coded that to a very specific transformation. The subsequent examples reveal that the transformation of the third column and the addition of rows are more complex and depend on input grid. Examples 3 and 4 show that the row expansion relates to the initial height, but the column transformation appears unrelated to the input.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** We need to discard the assumption of a fixed transformation of the third column. Instead, we should search for the *relationship* between the input and output third columns.\n2.  **Dynamic Row Expansion:** The row expansion seems related to the input row count.\n3.  **Pattern in Third Column:** Closely re-examine the third column transformation in all examples, looking for relationships such as mirroring, shifting, or conditional changes.\n4.  **First row duplication** The first row of output appears in every example, even as the input dimensions change.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nI will structure observations as follows:\n\n*   **Example:** ID\n*   **Input Shape:** (rows, cols)\n*   **Output Shape:** (rows, cols)\n*   **Size Match:** (Boolean - Did transform match expected output size)\n*   **Pixel Match %:** (What % of pixels matched between expected and actual output)\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   Noteworthy relationships between input and output.\n    *   How the previous code's assumptions held or failed.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Example:** 1\n*   **Input Shape:** (3, 3)\n*   **Output Shape:** (5, 3)\n* **Observations**: First row duplicated in output. Third column becomes 3, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Example:** 2\n*   **Input Shape:** (3, 4)\n*   **Output Shape:** (6, 4)\n* **Observations**: First row duplicated in output. Third column becomes 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Example:** 3\n*   **Input Shape:** (4, 3)\n*   **Output Shape:** (6, 4)\n* **Observations**: First row duplicated in output. Third column becomes 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n*   **Example:** 4\n*   **Input Shape:** (4, 3)\n*   **Output Shape:** (6, 3)\n* **Observations**: First row duplicated in output. Third column becomes 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: variable\n      columns: variable\n      values: integers (0-9)\n\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: input_grid.rows + (input_grid.rows - 1) if input had 3 rows, input_grid.rows + 2 if input had 4 rows.\n      columns: input_grid.columns\n      values: integers (0-9)\n\nactions:\n  - name: copy_first_row\n    description: The first row of the input grid is copied to the first row of the output grid.\n  - name: copy_columns\n    description: All columns except for the last one are copied to output.\n  - name: transform_last_column\n    description: >\n      The last column of the input grid is transformed.  The\n      first element of this column of the input grid becomes the last\n      element of the same column of the output.\n  - name: add_rows\n    description: >-\n      Rows are added to the output grid.  The number of rows added is equal to input.rows - 1. New rows consist of 0, except for the first new row which contains the first element of the input grid, in the first position.\n  - name: zero_fill\n    description: Remaining cells in the output grid are filled with 0.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Copy all but last columns:** Copy all columns of the input grid to the output grid except for the last column.\n2.  **Duplicate the first row:** Duplicate the first row of the input grid to the\n    output grid\n3.  **Transform Last Column:** The last column of the output grid is based on the\n    last column of the input grid. The first pixel of the last column of the\n    input is copied. Then all other values are 0.\n4.  **Add Rows:** Add new rows to the bottom of the output grid. The number of\n    rows to add is one less than the number of rows of the input grid.\n5.  **Populate First New Row:**\n    The first element of the first added row contains first element of the\n    input grid. All other elements are zero.\n6. **Zero Fill New Rows** All other added rows are filled with zeros.\n\n"
