The input grid seems to contain distinct colored regions, while the output grid expands upon this, introducing a significant amount of white space (represented by '0'). The relative positioning of the original colors appears to be somewhat maintained, but mirrored and possibly inverted. There's a clear expansion in size, suggesting a scaling or replication factor at play, coupled with a transformation of the layout.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
