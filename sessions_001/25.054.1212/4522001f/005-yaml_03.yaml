objects:
  - description: Connected component of pixels of the same color.
    properties:
      - color: The color value of the pixels in the object.
      - shape: The arrangement of pixels forming the connected component.
      - bounding_box: min and max row/col that contain the shape
    actions:
      - identify: Determine connected pixels of same color
      - replicate: Copy shape to the center of output, with replication to scale by 3x

transformation:
  - description: The input grid's connected components are scaled by a factor of 3.
  - size: Output is a 3x scaled version of input grid size
  - object_scaling: Each object is scaled and output to the grid.
  - scaling method: Center the shape in scaled area
