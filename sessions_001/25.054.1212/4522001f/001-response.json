The primary color involved appears to be green (value 3), with some instances of red (value 2) and white (value 0). The output grid seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid, with the color green playing a dominant role. The original shape and size of non-white and non-red objects in the input grid is replicated.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Fill rest of the output grid by 0 (white color)\n\nIn essence, the program takes the original shape of all the adjacent green color pixels, and expands it by the scale, positioning it to the multiplied coordinates.\n"
