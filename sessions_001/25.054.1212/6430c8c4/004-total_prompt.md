Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Region of Interest:** Focus on the top-left section within rows 0-3 and columns 0-3 of the input grid which is all the values of '7'. All other areas will be ignored.
2.  **Translate Color:** Replace all values in the top left region of '7' to a single color, '3' (green).
3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 4x4 grid, representing the focused section in the top left hand corner.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the corresponding cells to the area of interest in the output grid. Where color 7 existed in the input grid within the 4x4 section, put colour 3 in the output grid.
5. **Default Background**: If any output cell is outside of the area identified in step one, set the color to 0 (white).

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While they correctly identified the color replacement (7 to 3) and the focus on a 4x4 region, the logic for *where* to place the replaced pixels is incorrect. The initial program assumed a direct, position-based replacement within the 4x4 grid.  The actual rule is more complex, involving a pattern within where the '7's exist, which might be some sort of flipping.

The consistent failure across all examples, with a high number of incorrect pixels, confirms that the core positional logic is flawed. The fact that size and color palette are correct indicates those aspects were understood, but their application is misdirected.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** We need to meticulously analyze the relationship between the positions of '7's in the input and '3's in the *correct* output.
2.  **Hypothesize a Refined Rule:** Develop a new hypothesis about the placement logic (e.g., a specific mirroring, rotation, or diagonal reflection within the 4x4 area).
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:**  Clearly articulate the refined rule.
4.  **Update code.**
5.  **Iterate:** Test, analyze results, and repeat the process.

**Example Metrics and Analysis (using previous results):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input '7' positions (within 4x4): (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)
    *   Expected Output '3' positions: (0,2), (1,0), (2,2), (3,1)
    *   Transformed Output '3' positions: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)
    *   Observation: No obvious direct mapping.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input '7' positions (within 4x4): (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1)
    *   Expected Output '3' positions: (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,3)
    *   Transformed output '3' positions: (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1)
    *    Observation: Again, no direct correspondence.

* **Example 3 and 4:** Input 7s do not seem to correspond at all.

actions:
  - type: transform
    input: color_7_pixels
    output: color_3_pixels
    rule: "complex positional mapping within region_of_interest - TBD"

```

**Natural Language Program (Revised - Iteration 2):**

1.  **Focus Area:** Consider only the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Source Pixels:**  Locate all pixels within this 4x4 section that have the value '7'.
3. **Determine Placement:** In the 4x4 output, replace any cell that *does not* contain a '7', with a '0'.
4. **Output Grid:** The output grid is always 4x4.
5. **Color Replacement:** The locations in the output are color '3' (green) if the corresponding location *in the input grid* is a '7'.
6.  **Background Color**: Any position *within the output grid* not occupied by the placement rule from Step 3 is set to '0' (white).

**Reasoning for update:**

The prior focused on direct replacement. After examining the examples, the rule
seems to require using the placement of color 7, but in reverse order in the x
and y, and subtracting the largest index from each. It's some sort of
transformation. I will test this hypothesis on the next turn.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
