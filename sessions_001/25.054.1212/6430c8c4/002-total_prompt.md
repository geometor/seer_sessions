## Example 1

**input:**
```
7 7 0 7
0 7 7 0
0 7 7 7
0 7 7 0
4 4 4 4
0 0 0 0
0 2 0 2
2 2 2 0
2 0 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC47F93CD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 0
3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4754A530>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to simplify this, primarily using '0' (white) and a single other color ('3', green in this case). There appears to be a spatial relationship or selection process determining which parts of the input are represented in the output. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (9x4 -> 4x4). The non-zero values in the output grid seem to correspond to specific regions or features in the input grid, possibly related to the color or arrangement of pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 9x4
      colors: [0, 2, 4, 7]
      description: Contains multiple colored regions.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 4x4
      colors: [0, 3]
      description: Simplified representation of the input.
  - observation: output_size_reduction
    description: The output grid is smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: color_change
    description: Some input colors map to different output colors (e.g., 7 -> 3).
  - observation: spatial_selection
    description: Only certain regions of the input are represented in the output, specifically the area in the top left area containing the colour 7, is mapped to 3.
  - observation: default_color
    description: Most of the output grid consists of the default color 0 (white).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region of Interest:** Focus on the top-left section within rows 0-3 and columns 0-3 of the input grid which is all the values of '7'. All other areas will be ignored.
2.  **Translate Color:** Replace all values in the top left region of '7' to a single color, '3' (green).
3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 4x4 grid, representing the focused section in the top left hand corner.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the corresponding cells to the area of interest in the output grid. Where color 7 existed in the input grid within the 4x4 section, put colour 3 in the output grid.
5. **Default Background**: If any output cell is outside of the area identified in step one, set the color to 0 (white).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
