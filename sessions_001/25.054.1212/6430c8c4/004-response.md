1.  **Focus Area:** Consider only the top-left 4x4 section of the input grid.
2.  **Identify Source Pixels:**  Locate all pixels within this 4x4 section that have the value '7'.
3. **Determine Placement:** In the 4x4 output, replace any cell that *does not* contain a '7', with a '0'.
4. **Output Grid:** The output grid is always 4x4.
5. **Color Replacement:** The locations in the output are color '3' (green) if the corresponding location *in the input grid* is a '7'.
6.  **Background Color**: Any position *within the output grid* not occupied by the placement rule from Step 3 is set to '0' (white).
