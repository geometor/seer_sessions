The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to simplify this, primarily using '0' (white) and a single other color ('3', green in this case). There appears to be a spatial relationship or selection process determining which parts of the input are represented in the output. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (9x4 -> 4x4). The non-zero values in the output grid seem to correspond to specific regions or features in the input grid, possibly related to the color or arrangement of pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All other areas will be ignored.\n2.  **Translate Color:** Replace all values in the top left region of '7' to a single color, '3' (green).\n3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new 4x4 grid, representing the focused section in the top left hand corner.\n4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the corresponding cells to the area of interest in the output grid. Where color 7 existed in the input grid within the 4x4 section, put colour 3 in the output grid.\n5. **Default Background**: If any output cell is outside of the area identified in step one, set the color to 0 (white).\n\n"
