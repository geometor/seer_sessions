task: 022
summary: |
  The input grid is divided into two regions by a horizontal line of yellow pixels. The area above the yellow line is transformed by mirroring the orange pixels across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right), changing their color to green in the output grid.
objects:
  - id: divider
    type: horizontal_line
    color: yellow
    properties:
      - divides the grid into upper and lower regions
  - id: upper_region
    type: grid_region
    properties:
      - located above the divider
      - contains orange and white pixels.
      - determines the output size.
  - id: orange_pixels
