    objects:
      - type: grid
        properties:
          role: input
          dimensions: variable
          elements: pixels (0-9)
      - type: grid
        properties:
          role: output
          dimensions: 4x4
          elements: pixels (0-9)
      - type: subgrid

          dimensions: 2x2
          parent: input_grid
          contains: pixels
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: orange (7)
          role: trigger
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: green (3)
          role: result
    actions:
      - description: Scan input grid by 2x2 subgrids.
      - description: Check for presence of orange pixel within subgrid.
      - description: If orange pixel present, place a green pixel in the output grid.
      - description: Output grid location is determined by the location of the 2x2 subgrid, mapping to the quadrant in the output grid.
    rules:
      - condition: Orange pixel exists in 2x2 subgrid.
        action: Place a green pixel in output grid.
        location_rule: |
          The row and column of the 2x2 subgrid within the input grid (when dividing the input into 2x2 sections) determines a corresponding position in the output grid. The x coordinate of the orange pixel determines the x coordinate of the output green pixel and the y coordinate of the orange determines the y coordinate of the output green pixel.
