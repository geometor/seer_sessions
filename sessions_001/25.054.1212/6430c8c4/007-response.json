            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified representation, primarily using '0' (white) and '3' (green). The output grid is smaller in both dimensions compared to the input grid. There appears to be some form of object detection or pattern recognition involved, where specific regions in the input are mapped to single pixels in the output. The colors in the input don't seem to directly correlate to output, and it appears to be a spatial reduction where multiple cells of the input map to a single cell in the output by detecting regions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this case, input grid rows = 9, output rows = 4, 9//4 = 2, the result is subgrids of 2x2.\n2.  **Reduce and replace**: Starting from the beginning of each row scan along columns and process 2x2 subgrids until the end of the row is reached.  Start the next row.\n3. **First row**: If the upper left 2x2 subgrid is reached, and it consists of any non-zero numbers, replace entire 2x2 block by a single pixel of value '3' (green). Assign 3 to the first position of output.\n4. **Continuation:** Continue to select and process the next 2x2 non-overlapping blocks by selecting a single '3'(green) to the subgrid that contains one or more values of 7(orange)\n5. **Last rows**: if last row(s) are left, ignore if odd, and output 0 if even\n\n"
