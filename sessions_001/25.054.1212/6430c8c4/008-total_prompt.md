## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 7 7
0 0 7 7
0 7 7 0
7 7 0 0
4 4 4 4
2 0 2 0
0 2 0 2
0 2 2 0
0 0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x576 at 0x7BFC475868F0>

**output:**
```
0 3 0 0
3 0 0 0
3 0 0 3
0 0 0 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC4754A530>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified representation, primarily using '0' (white) and '3' (green). The output grid is smaller in both dimensions compared to the input grid. There appears to be some form of object detection or pattern recognition involved, where specific regions in the input are mapped to single pixels in the output. The colors in the input don't seem to directly correlate to output, and it appears to be a spatial reduction where multiple cells of the input map to a single cell in the output by detecting regions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 9x4 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Output grid is 4x4 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Input grid contains colors: 0 (white), 7 (orange), 4 (yellow), 2 (red).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors: 0 (white), 3 (green).
  - observation: Output grid's top-left corner corresponds to a region in the input grid containing 0s, and 7s (white and orange), and is represented as a 3(green) or a 0(white) in the output based on criteria
  - relationship: the output dimensions seems close to input dimensions / 2, dropping remainders
  - observation: The orange colored 7's occupy the upper left corner quadrant of the input
  - observation: Yellow 4's in input are in one row
  - observation: Red 2's in input are grouped in the bottom right half of the grid, interspered with 0's (white)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into 2x2, non-overlapping subgrids, the size is calculated by finding input_dimension/output_dimension and dropping any remainder. In this case, input grid rows = 9, output rows = 4, 9//4 = 2, the result is subgrids of 2x2.
2.  **Reduce and replace**: Starting from the beginning of each row scan along columns and process 2x2 subgrids until the end of the row is reached.  Start the next row.
3. **First row**: If the upper left 2x2 subgrid is reached, and it consists of any non-zero numbers, replace entire 2x2 block by a single pixel of value '3' (green). Assign 3 to the first position of output.
4. **Continuation:** Continue to select and process the next 2x2 non-overlapping blocks by selecting a single '3'(green) to the subgrid that contains one or more values of 7(orange)
5. **Last rows**: if last row(s) are left, ignore if odd, and output 0 if even


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
