"""
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. The output grid
consists only of azure (8) and blue (1) pixels. The transformation does not
depend on input colors. The exact logic for the positions of the 8 and 1 is not
fully understood, however, it's not the initially proposed alternating
checkerboard based on row and column position. There seem to be sequences or
blocks/chunks of 8 and 1 of varying lengths horizontally and vertically. There
appears to be an alternating set of runs of adjacent 8s or adjacent 1s in rows
and columns, that repeat every 4 or 5 pixels.
