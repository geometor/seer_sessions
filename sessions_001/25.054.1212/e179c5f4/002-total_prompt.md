## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x640 at 0x7BFC47F93C70>

**output:**
```
8 1
1 8
8 1
1 8
8 1
1 8
8 1
1 8
8 1
1 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x640 at 0x7BFC47F93F10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid consists primarily of white pixels (0) with a single blue pixel (1) at the bottom left corner. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but the pixels alternate between azure (8) and blue (1), starting with azure in the top-left corner. The pattern is consistent across rows and columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x2
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        dominant: true
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        location: bottom-left corner
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x2
    elements:
      - color: azure
        value: 8
      - color: blue
        value: 1
    pattern: alternating
    pattern_start: azure (top-left)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.

2.  **Alternating Pattern:** Iterate through each cell of the output grid, row by row, and column by column.

3.  **Color Assignment:**
    *   If the sum of the row index and column index is even, assign the cell the color azure (8).
    *   If the sum of the row index and column index is odd, assign the cell the color blue (1).

This program describes a simple checkerboard-like pattern creation, replacing all input pixels with an alternating sequence of azure and blue, regardless of the original pixel values in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
