Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Center:** Find the coordinates of the single pixel with the value '1' (blue) in the input grid.
2.  **Fill Background:** Replace all '0' (white) pixels in the input grid with '8' (azure). This creates the background for the output.
3. **Create Cross:**
   * Using the coordinates of the located '1' (the center) from step 1:
   * Along the x-axis (row), starting at the center coordinate and extending outwards in both directions:
      Alternate by placing first an 8 then a 1.
   * Along the y-axis (column), starting at the center coordinate and extending outwards in both directions:
        Alternate by placing first a 1 then an 8.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
