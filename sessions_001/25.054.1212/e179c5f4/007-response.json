The input grid contains mostly '0' (white) pixels, with a single '1' (blue) pixel near the bottom left. The output grid seems to \"replace\" all '0' values based on a pattern related to distance from the original '1' pixel. The '1' pixel itself appears to remain unchanged in position, however, the surrounding pixels alternate between '8' (azure) and '1' (blue) and the overall appearance of the grid resembles a checkerboard, centered around the original single blue pixel.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The result is a checkered board of '8' and '1' pixels, where all original '0's in the input grid are replaced.\n\nIn summary: find the '1' pixel, and replace the '0' pixels, producing a checkerboard pattern centered on the original '1' pixel.\n"
