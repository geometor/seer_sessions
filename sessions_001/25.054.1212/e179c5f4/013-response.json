The input grid appears to be mostly filled with 0s (white), with a single 1 (blue) in the bottom-left corner. The output grid replaces all 0s with 8s (azure) and the single 1 with, well, a pattern centered on the original location of the 1. The transformation seems to involve flood-filling with the 8s, then constructing a cross.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
