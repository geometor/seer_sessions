  - task_id: 004
  - example_1:
      input_grid_shape: [10, 2]
      output_grid_shape: [10, 2]
      output_colors: [8, 1]  # Azure and Blue
      output_pattern: |
          Alternating runs of 8 and 1 in both rows and columns.  Run lengths vary, appearing to follow a sequence. The current 2x2 block algorithm does not match this.
      discrepancies: |
         Transformed grid shows repeating 2x2 blocks of 8s and 1s. Expected grid has alternating single rows.
  - example_2:
      input_grid_shape: [10, 3]
      output_grid_shape: [10, 3]
      output_colors: [8, 1]
      output_pattern: |
         Runs of 8s and 1s, lengths vary, alternating in rows and columns.
      discrepancies: |
         Transformed grid shows 2x2 blocks, while expected output shows runs of length 1, 2 and 3.
  - example_3:
      input_grid_shape: [10, 4]
      output_grid_shape: [10, 4]
      output_colors: [8, 1]
      output_pattern: |
           Runs of 8s and 1s, lengths vary. The runs alternate in both rows and columns.
      discrepancies: |
        Transformed grid consists of 2x2 repeating blocks.  Expected has varying run lengths (1, 2, and 3).
