## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 7 8 8 8
5 5 6 5 4
8 5 5 5 2
8 8 4 3 6
6 5 1 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4757B340>

**output:**
```
2 7 5 5 5
8 8 6 8 4
5 8 8 8 2
5 5 4 3 6
6 8 1 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47579300>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 5x5 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a specific color swap or replacement, potentially based on position or neighboring colors. It doesn't appear to be a simple rotation, mirroring, or global color substitution, as the changes are localized. Some colors stay the same between input and output while other changes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: cells
    properties:
      - name: color
        type: integer
        range: 0-9
  - type: cell
    properties:
      - row:
         type: integer
         range: 0-4
      - col:
         type: integer
         range: 0-4
      - color_in:
         type: integer
      - color_out:
         type: integer

actions:
  - name: color_swap
    type: conditional replacement
    conditions:
      - if color is 'x' then replace by color 'y'

relationships:
  - spatial: adjacent (cells)
  - grid_contains: cells

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  For cell at \[0,2], \[0,3] and \[0,4] (the first row, third, fourth and fifth columns): If the input color is azure (8), change it to gray (5).
3.  For cell at \[1,0]: If the input color is gray (5), change it to azure (8).
4.  For cell at \[1,1]: If the input color is gray (5), change it to azure (8).
5.  For cell at \[2,0]: If the input color is azure (8), change it to gray (5).
6.  For cell at \[2,1]: If the input color is azure (8), change it to gray (5).
7.  For cell at \[3,0]: If the input color is azure (8), change it to gray(5).
8.  For cell at \[3,1]: If the input color is azure (8), change it to gray (5).
9.  For cell at \[4,1]: If the input color is gray (5), change it to azure (8).

Essentially, specific instances of azure (8) and gray(5) are swapped based on their original position within the grid. All the other cells remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
