Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a specific color swap or replacement, potentially based on position or neighboring colors. It doesn't appear to be a simple rotation, mirroring, or global color substitution, as the changes are localized. Some colors stay the same between input and output while other changes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
