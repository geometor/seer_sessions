Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary difference between the input and output grids is their dimensions, with the input grid is 3x4, and the output is 6x4. The output grid appears to be a patterned repetition of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
