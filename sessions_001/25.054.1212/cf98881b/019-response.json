The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed version, retaining some, but not all, of the original colors and shapes. The most notable colors in the input are yellow (4), red (2), maroon (9), and blue (1), and white (0). The output seems to focus on yellow (4), maroon (9), and a single blue (1) pixel, with other elements disappearing. It appears there is some type of selection and possibly spatial rearrangement or cropping.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
