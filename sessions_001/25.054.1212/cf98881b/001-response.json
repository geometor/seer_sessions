The colors and their corresponding digits are:\n\n*   0: White\n*   1: Blue\n*   2: Red\n*   3: Green\n*   4: Yellow\n*   5: Gray\n*   6: Magenta\n*   7: Orange\n*   8: Azure\n*   9: Maroon\n\nThe input grid appears to be larger (4x14) than the output grid (4x4). There's no obvious one-to-one mapping of input cells to output cells. Certain colors are entirely removed during the transformation (red, white, blue). Specific instances of colors remain. It appears that a selection and reduction process takes place, and there might be rules about retaining or deleting colors and specific locations of color instances.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Do *not* select all columns, only the select columns identified by the rule.\n\n2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** From the selected columns, create a new grid, discarding all others.\n\n3. **Reduce Further:** Consider only the first instance of a contiguous vertical sequence of a single color. Discard any subsequent, matching color that is contiguous vertically.\n\n4. **Result:** the output grid contains only 4x4\n"
