            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code is based on the idea of finding the largest yellow object, extracting a bounding box around it, expanding the box to include adjacent blue pixels, and then setting all non-yellow, non-blue pixels within that box to white. This approach works partially but fails to correctly capture the full complexity of the transformations in all examples. The primary issue seems to be an incomplete expansion of the yellow bounding box to include all connected and adjacent blue pixels. The code attempts to find and expand, but the implementation has flaws in how it is searching/expanding. It looks like there may also be an error in handling some of the colors, or placement of certain colors.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve Bounding Box Expansion:** The current `expand_bounding_box_for_blue` function has flaw. It appears to only expand by checking neighbors of existing blue pixels within a box, rather than checking the borders around the yellow for blue, and performing a full expansion. The corrected logic should iterate around the perimeter of the initial yellow bounding box, checking for adjacent blue pixels and expanding the box accordingly. This may need to happen iteratively until no more blue pixels are found adjacent to the expanded box.\n\n2.  **Review Color Handling:** Double-check that the color replacement logic (setting non-yellow/blue to white) is correctly applied *after* the final bounding box is determined.\n\n3. **Iterative Refinement of Program**: Make sure the bounding box contains all of the necessary pixels by checking neighbor pixels for both blue AND yellow iteratively.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_shape: [4, 14]\n    output_shape: [4, 4]\n    match: False\n    pixels_off: 5\n    size_correct: True\n    color_palette_correct: True\n    correct_pixel_counts: False\n    notes: >\n      Fails to incorporate all '9' and blue pixels ('1') correctly. The\n      expansion logic around the border of the initial yellow object is not\n      including a blue '1' that it should.\n      The transformed grid should have one '9' that it does not, but\n      it does correctly include all the yellows.\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_shape: [4, 14]\n    output_shape: [4, 4]\n    match: False\n    pixels_off: 3 #confirmed with code\n    size_correct: False\n    color_palette_correct: True\n    correct_pixel_counts: False\n    notes: >\n        Missing a row. It looks like the box expansion is still not working -\n        it fails to capture a blue pixel ('1') in row 3, column 2 and another '1'\n        in the last row that should expand the final bounding box.\n        There is also a 9 that should be a 0 in the bottom row.\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_shape: [4, 14]\n    output_shape: [4, 4]\n    match: False\n    pixels_off: 5\n    size_correct: True\n    color_palette_correct: True\n    correct_pixel_counts: False\n    notes: >\n        Fails to switch the colors. The bounding box seems like it might be\n        working, however it did not swap the colors.\n\n  - example_id: 4\n    input_shape: [4, 14]\n    output_shape: [4, 4]\n    match: False\n    pixels_off: 3\n    size_correct: True\n    color_palette_correct: True\n    correct_pixel_counts: False\n    notes: >\n      It looks like there is a problem with the colors. The right '9' is not\n      being changed to a '0', and '0' that should be '9'.\n\n  - example_id: 5\n    input_shape: [4, 14]\n    output_shape: [4, 4]\n    match: False\n    pixels_off: 3\n    size_correct: True\n    color_palette_correct: True\n    correct_pixel_counts: False\n    notes: >\n        The box appears to be the correct dimensions, but fails to swap certain\n        pixels, including replacing '0' with '1'.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Largest Yellow Object:** Find the largest contiguous region of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Contiguous means connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n2.  **Initial Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses all pixels of the largest yellow object.\n\n3.  **Iterative Expansion:**\n    *   Expand the bounding box to include *any* blue (1) pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the *current* bounding box's perimeter.\n    *   Expand the bounding box to include *any* yellow (4) pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the *current* bounding box's perimeter.\n    *   Repeat the previous two steps until no more blue or yellow pixels are found adjacent to the bounding box perimeter.\n\n4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the portion of the input grid contained within the final expanded bounding box.\n\n5. **Color Simplification:** Within the extracted subgrid, change all pixels that are *not* yellow (4) or blue (1) to white (0).\n"
