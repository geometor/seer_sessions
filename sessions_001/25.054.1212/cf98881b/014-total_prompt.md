## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 4 4 0 2 9 9 0 9 2 0 1 0 1
0 4 0 4 2 0 0 9 0 2 0 1 0 0
0 4 0 4 2 0 0 9 9 2 1 0 0 1
4 0 4 4 2 9 9 9 0 2 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7BFC441A2350>

**output:**
```
4 4 4 9
0 4 9 4
1 4 9 4
4 9 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC441A0E50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be a simplified representation, focusing on specific colors and their spatial relationships. The most prominent colors in the input appear to be yellow (4) and maroon (9), which also feature significantly in the output. There's an apparent reduction in the number of elements and a potential focus on a specific area or pattern within the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x15
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9] # white, blue, red, yellow, maroon
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x4
      - colors: [0, 1, 4, 9] # white, blue, yellow, maroon
  - observation: color_dominance
    description: Yellow (4) and Maroon (9) are the most prevalent colors in both input and output grids.
  - observation: spatial_reduction
    description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - observation: pattern: possible subgrid selection from input
  - observation: positional_relationship: relative position maintained
    description: elements in output are positioned relative to each other like the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The target colors for the output grid are yellow (4) and maroon (9).
2.  **Locate Subgrid:** within input\_grid, locate a minimal rectangular sub-grid that contains every instance of color 9.
3.  **Select Columns/Rows:** select from input\_grid, any column that contains an element of color 9 and keep all rows.
4. **compose output:** construct output\_grid from the selected subgrid.

Essentially, the transformation extracts a specific region from the input grid, defined by columns containing at least one maroon (9). The output grid preserves the relative positioning of pixels from the selection.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
