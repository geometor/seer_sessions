Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and code were too simplistic. While they correctly identified the relevant columns (those containing 4, 9, or 1), the vertical reduction logic and final grid selection are flawed. The current `reduce_vertically` function simply takes the *first* instance of *any* color in a column, which doesn't capture the intended behavior. The program fails to capture the full logic of selecting and re-arranging specific columns. All the examples fail with the same type of error - it seems to be grabbing too early - as if the first encountered object of a color is the important one. The sizes are correct, and only the colors present appear, but many of them are wrong, or zero/blank (white).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Column Selection:** The column selection criteria (containing 4, 9, or 1) seem correct based on all examples, but the *order* in which these columns are reassembled into the output grid is critical and not currently handled correctly. We need to observe how those chosen columns get ordered relative to each other.
2.  **Refine Vertical Reduction:** The concept of "first contiguous vertical sequence" is on the right track, but the implementation is too broad. It should only keep a color if that same color at the start of the sequence, not just any color. The core issue here is incorrect object detection.
3.  **Output Size:** The current code limits the output grid to a maximum of 4 columns. This assumption coincidentally aligns with the examples, but should be explicitly defined by the transformation rule.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

I'll use a concise format to summarize each example. Focus is on the order of selected columns and vertical reduction.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input columns with 9, 4, or 1: \[1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11]
    *   Expected Output Column order: 5, 1, 7, 3
    *   Issue: Order and vertical reduction incorrect.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input columns with 9, 4, or 1: \[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11]
    *   Expected output column order: 0, 1, 2, 11
    *   Issue: Order and vertical reduction incorrect.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input columns with 9, 4, or 1: \[0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13]
    *    Expected output column order: 0, 1, 8, 5
    *    Issue: Order and vertical reduction incorrect.

*    **Example 4:**
     *    Input columns with 9, 4, or 1: \[3, 5, 8, 10, 11]
     *    Expected output column order: 10, 3, 8, 3
     *    Issue: Order and vertical reduction incorrect.

*   **Example 5:**
    *   Input columns with 9, 4, or 1: \[0, 2, 3, 8, 10, 11]
    *   Expected Output column order: 10, 0, 2, 3
    *   Issue: Order and vertical reduction is incorrect.

    output: output_grid
    description: keep at most 4 columns.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Examine the input grid and identify columns that contain at least one pixel with the color 4 (blue), 9 (maroon), or 1 (blue).

2. **Determine Column Output Order:** There's an ordering rule. *observe the relationship between where the first instance of each target color appears (4, 9, or 1) and how they are arranged in the output. *It seems like the order is determined, not by the column index itself, but a property of the target column*

3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new, intermediate grid containing *only* the target columns, *preserving the newly determined order.*

4.  **Vertical Reduction:** Within each column of the intermediate grid:
    *   Identify contiguous vertical sequences (blocks) of the *same* color.
    *   Keep only the *first* such sequence encountered in each column, setting other pixels in that column to color 0 (white).

5. **Limit Size** Keep only the first 4 columns (or fewer if less than 4 were created)

6.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the final output.

Key Improvements and Remaining Questions:

*   The column selection criteria are clarified.
*   The need for column reordering is highlighted. The *major* missing piece is the exact rule for ordering the columns. This requires more analysis across more examples, and probably cannot be solved from the provided training examples.
*   Vertical reduction is better defined, focusing on contiguous sequences of the *same* color.
* Added step to explicitly limit the output to 4 columns.

The next step will be to modify the code to reflect this refined natural language program, especially the crucial column ordering and more precise vertical reduction.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
