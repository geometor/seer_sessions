facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 4 x 15
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      colors_present: [0, 1, 2, 4, 9]

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 4 x 4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      colors_present: [0,1,4,9]

  - observation: color_selection
    description: Only specific colors from the input grid appear in the output grid.
    selected_colors: [1, 4, 9]

  - observation: spatial_relationship
    description: The relative positions of some colors are maintained, but the overall structure is compressed. The output appears to be a cropped selection. The columns in input that contain [4,4,4,4] appear important

  - observation: cropping
    description: columns with any of [1,4,9]
