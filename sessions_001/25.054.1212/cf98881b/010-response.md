1. **Identify Cropping Region:** Determine the top-left coordinates (row, col) of the 4x4 region within the input grid that will become the output grid. The method for selecting this region is currently unknown, but it's not always (0,0).

2. **Crop:** Extract the 4x4 sub-grid from the input grid, starting at the identified (row, col) coordinates.

3. **Color Substitution:** Within the cropped 4x4 region:
    *   Change all pixels with the value `2` (red) to `1` (blue).
    *   Leave pixels with values `0`, `4`, and `9` unchanged.
