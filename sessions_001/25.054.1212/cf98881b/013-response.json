The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be a simplified representation, focusing on specific colors and their spatial relationships. The most prominent colors in the input appear to be yellow (4) and maroon (9), which also feature significantly in the output. There's an apparent reduction in the number of elements and a potential focus on a specific area or pattern within the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
