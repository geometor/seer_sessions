The input grid appears to be larger (14x4) than the output grid (4x4).  There's a noticeable reduction in the variety of colors used in the output compared to the input. Certain colors seem to be selectively retained while others are removed or replaced.  The spatial arrangement of the remaining pixels is also altered, suggesting a cropping or extraction process, possibly combined with a substitution or filtering based on color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The exact location of this sub-grid within the larger input grid is not immediately obvious but appears to be determined, at least partially, by areas that are not needed (like large areas of the same color).\n\n2. **Color Substitution/Filter:**\n    -   All the pixels with value `2` (red) are changed to the value `1` (blue)\n    -  All the pixels with value `0` remain unchanged\n    -   All the pixels with value `4` remain unchanged\n    -  All the pixels with the value `9` remains unchanged.\n    - Remove or ignore all other colors.\n\nEssentially, a specific 4x4 region of interest is extracted, and then a color simplification/substitution is applied.\n"
