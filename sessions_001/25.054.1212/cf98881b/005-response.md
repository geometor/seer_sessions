Here's an analysis of the results and a revised natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of selecting columns based on the presence of colors 4, 9, and 1, and then ordering them by the first occurrence of these colors, is partially correct. However, the vertical reduction logic and the final column selection need refinement. The main issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Vertical Reduction:** The `reduce_vertically` function doesn't correctly preserve the first contiguous sequence. It sometimes includes pixels from subsequent sequences or misses pixels within the first sequence, as show in the output images.
2.  **Column Selection and Ordering** It looks like the ordering of the colors should be considered, but the row index sorting isn't quite correct, and there seems to be a mixing of top-down and bottom-up selection.
3. **Missing Pixel Preservation** Some output images show pixels in the correct place, some pixels with colors switched, and other instances of missing data.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Revise `reduce_vertically`:** Implement a more robust algorithm for identifying and preserving *only* the first contiguous block of each color within a column.
2.  **Revisit Column Ordering Logic:** Examine the examples more closely. Determine which colors appear in the result, and which are filtered. It seems 9,4,1 are included but the ordering isn't a simple sort - it looks like the location of the *last* instance of each color is a factor.
3. **Consider final four columns:** The output is always limited to the *first* four columns. Verify this as fact.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I will use a python script to check my assumptions.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - shape: rows x columns (variable)
      - target_colors: [9, 4, 1] # Maroon, Yellow, Blue
  - name: column
    type: 1D array
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9)

  - name: contiguous_block
    type: sequence of cells
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - location: row and column indices
      - first_instance: boolean

actions:
  - name: select_columns
    input: grid
    output: set of columns
    logic: Select columns containing at least one cell with value in target_colors.

  - name: determine_order
    input: set of columns and input_grid
    output: ordered list of columns, last_occurrence_row
    logic:
      - For each target color, find the *last* row index where it occurs, across the entire grid.
      - Sort colors based on these indices from largest to smallest.
      - Within each color group, maintain original column order from the input.

  - name: extract_subgrid
    input: grid, ordered columns
    output: grid
    logic: Create a new grid containing only the ordered columns.

  - name: reduce_vertical
    input: grid
    output: grid
    logic: For each column, keep only the *first* contiguous block of non-zero pixels.

  - name: limit_columns
    input: grid
    output: grid
    logic: take first 4 columns

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Examine the input grid. Identify columns that contain at least one pixel of color 9 (maroon), 4 (yellow), or 1 (blue).

2.  **Determine Column Output Order and Color Priority**:
    *   Find the *last* occurrence (highest row index) of each of the target colors (9, 4, and 1) within the *entire* input grid.
    *   Sort the target colors in descending order based on the row index of their last occurrence.
    * generate a list of target columns - preserving the original order
    * reorder the target columns based on color priority - if a column contains multiple colors from the target list, use the color with the highest priority.

3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid (the "subgrid") consisting only of the target columns from the input grid, using the reordered column list from step 2.

4.  **Vertical Reduction:** For *each* column in the subgrid:
    *   Identify the *first* contiguous block of non-zero pixels.
    *   Set all other pixels in that column to 0 (white).

5.  **Column Limit:** Keep only the first 4 columns (or fewer, if less then 4 columns are available)

6.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the final output.
