            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of selecting columns containing color 9 was partially correct in identifying a relevant aspect of the transformation (the importance of color 9). However, it's clear that simply selecting *all* columns with color 9 and keeping all rows doesn't produce the correct output. The expected outputs have different colors and arrangements, suggesting a more complex selection and potentially some form of mirroring or reflection, and attention to more than one color. It is clear we are only focused on a single color in the provided code.\n\nThe expected outputs consistently have a 4x4 dimension. The original approach doesn't enforce this, often producing outputs that aren't 4x4. We must take another look at the examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* example input-output pairs, not just the first one, to discern a consistent pattern. Pay close attention to the relationship between the position and arrangement of color 9 *and other colors* in the input and output.\n2.  **Consider Other Operations:** The transformation isn't just about selecting columns. It likely involves a combination of selection and potentially other operations.\n3.  **Dimensionality Constraint:** Ensure the output grid is always 4x4. This might involve padding with a default color (e.g., 0) if the selected region is smaller, or cropping if it's larger.\n4.  The result image shows a mirror of the prediction, so let's get that in there.\n\n**Example Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's examine the provided input and predicted output pairs and calculate some simple metrics like dimensions, unique colors and count of colors.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_grid(grid, name):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    dimensions = grid.shape\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)\n    color_counts = {color: np.count_nonzero(grid == color) for color in unique_colors}\n    print(f\"{name}:\")\n    print(f\"  Dimensions: {dimensions}\")\n    print(f\"  Unique Colors: {unique_colors}\")\n    print(f\"  Color Counts: {color_counts}\")\n\nexamples = [\n    {\n        \"input\": [\n            [0, 4, 0, 4, 2, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n            [4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 9, 0, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n        ],\n        \"expected\": [\n            [9, 4, 0, 4],\n            [0, 4, 9, 9],\n            [4, 1, 1, 0],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4]\n        ],\n        \"predicted\": [\n            [9, 9, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 9, 9],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [9, 0, 9, 0]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 9, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n            [4, 4, 0, 0, 2, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n            [4, 0, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n        ],\n        \"expected\": [\n            [4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 0, 0],\n            [4, 1, 4, 4],\n            [1, 0, 9, 0]\n        ],\n        \"predicted\": [\n            [9, 0, 9, 0],\n            [9, 9, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0, 9],\n            [0, 0, 9, 0]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n       \"input\": [\n            [4, 4, 4, 0, 2, 9, 9, 0, 9, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n            [0, 4, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n            [0, 4, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n            [4, 0, 4, 4, 2, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n        ],\n        \"expected\": [\n            [4, 4, 4, 9],\n            [0, 4, 9, 4],\n            [1, 4, 9, 4],\n            [4, 9, 4, 4]\n        ],\n        \"predicted\": [\n            [9, 9, 0, 9],\n            [0, 0, 9, 0],\n            [0, 0, 9, 9],\n            [9, 9, 9, 0]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [\n            [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [4, 4, 0, 4, 2, 9, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [4, 0, 4, 4, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n            [0, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n        ],\n        \"expected\": [\n            [0, 0, 0, 4],\n            [4, 4, 9, 4],\n            [4, 9, 4, 4],\n            [1, 4, 4, 4]\n        ],\n        \"predicted\": [\n            [0, 0, 0, 9],\n            [9, 0, 9, 0],\n            [0, 9, 9, 0],\n            [0, 9, 0, 0]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [\n            [4, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n            [0, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 9, 9, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n            [0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n        ],\n        \"expected\": [\n            [4, 0, 4, 1],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [1, 4, 4, 4],\n            [0, 4, 4, 1]\n        ],\n        \"predicted\": [\n            [0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 9],\n            [9, 9, 0],\n            [0, 9, 0]\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    analyze_grid(example[\"input\"], \"  Input\")\n    analyze_grid(example[\"expected\"], \"  Expected\")\n    analyze_grid(example[\"predicted\"], \"  Predicted\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n```"
