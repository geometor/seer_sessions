## Example 2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 2 9 0 9 0 2 0 0 0 1
4 4 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 2 1 0 0 0
4 0 4 4 2 0 0 0 9 2 0 1 0 1
0 0 0 0 2 0 0 9 0 2 1 0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7BFC441A2350>

**output:**
```
4 4 4 4
4 4 0 0
4 1 4 4
1 0 9 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC441A19C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger (14x4) than the output grid (4x4).  There's a noticeable reduction in the variety of colors used in the output compared to the input. Certain colors seem to be selectively retained while others are removed or replaced.  The spatial arrangement of the remaining pixels is also altered, suggesting a cropping or extraction process, possibly combined with a substitution or filtering based on color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid_input:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 14x4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        - contains multiple colors
  - grid_output:
      type: 2D array
      dimensions: 4x4
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        - contains a subset of input colors
        - specific spatial arrangement

actions:
  - crop:
      description: Selects a sub-region of the input grid.
      parameters:
        start_row: unknown
        start_col: unknown
        end_row: unknown
        end_col: unknown
  - filter_colors:
    description: removes or substitute colors.
  - substitute:
      description: Replaces certain colors with others.
      parameters:
        original_color: [2,9]
        replacement_color: [1,9]

relationships:
  - grid_output is derived from grid_input
  - cropping defines the spatial boundaries of the output
  - filter/substitute defines the color composition of output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Crop:** Extract a 4x4 sub-grid from the input grid. The exact location of this sub-grid within the larger input grid is not immediately obvious but appears to be determined, at least partially, by areas that are not needed (like large areas of the same color).

2. **Color Substitution/Filter:**
    -   All the pixels with value `2` (red) are changed to the value `1` (blue)
    -  All the pixels with value `0` remain unchanged
    -   All the pixels with value `4` remain unchanged
    -  All the pixels with the value `9` remains unchanged.
    - Remove or ignore all other colors.

Essentially, a specific 4x4 region of interest is extracted, and then a color simplification/substitution is applied.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
