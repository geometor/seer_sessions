## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 5 4
5 5 5
4 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93910>

**output:**
```
0 4 0
4 4 4
0 4 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the digits 4 and 5 (yellow and gray), while the output grid contains 0 and 4 (white and yellow). The transformation seems to involve replacing all 5s with 4s, and all 4s with 0s. It appears that a simple color substitution/replacement rule is in play.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color_coded: true  # Values correspond to colors

input_state:
  - object: grid
    values: [[4, 5, 4], [5, 5, 5], [4, 5, 4]]

output_state:
  - object: grid
    values: [[0, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4], [0, 4, 0]]

actions:
  - type: value_replacement
    details: "Replace all occurrences of 5 with 4, and all occurrences of 4 with 0"

relationships:
  - type: element-wise_transformation
    description: "Each cell in the input grid maps to a corresponding cell in the output grid."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **If** the cell value is 5 (gray), **replace** it with 4 (yellow).
3.  **If** the cell value is 4 (yellow), **replace** it with 0 (white).
4.  **Otherwise**, keep cell unchanged (there are none in this example)
5. The new values make up the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
