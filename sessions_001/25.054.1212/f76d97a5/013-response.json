The input grid contains two colors (represented by 9 and 5) while the output grid mostly uses another, third color (represented by 0), and uses the number '9' from the original input grid in certain places. The positions of '9' in the output seem to correlate with the positions of '9' and '5' from the input. It appears that 5's are replaced by 0's, and 9's are either kept as 9's, or replaced with 0's.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Otherwise the element '9' is replaced by '0'.\n5.  **Replace 5s**: If a cell in the input grid is a '5', the corresponding position of the output grid will be a '0'.\n\nIn summary, the output grid is derived based on a specific context of the position and adjacency properties of the input grid: 9's neighboring 5's on the right or down are replaced with 0. Otherwise they stay 9, and all 5s are replaced with 0.\n"
