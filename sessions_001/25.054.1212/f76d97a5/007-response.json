            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains two colors: gray (5) and magenta (6). The output grid contains magenta (6) and white (0). The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant (5x5). The core change seems to be a replacement of certain colors based on their spatial arrangement or neighbors. Specifically, all gray pixels are changed to white, and some magenta pixels are also changed to white. It appears that magenta pixels that have many gray neighbors, or are surrounded by an L-shape of magenta, are changed.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

If a pixel is gray (5), change it to white (0).\n3.  **Magenta Replacement (Conditional):** Iterate through the grid again.\n    *   Examine the color magenta (6)\n    *   For each pixel that has the color magenta (6) replace with white (0) if the pixel meets *any* of the following conditions:\n        *   The pixel is located in either the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right corner.\n        *   If the pixel directly to its left *and* the pixel directly above it have a magenta (6) color.\n        *    If the pixel directly to its right *and* the pixel directly above it have a magenta (6) color.\n        *   If the pixel directly to its left *and* the pixel directly below it have a magenta (6) color.\n        *    If the pixel directly to its right *and* the pixel directly below it have a magenta (6) color.\n\n4.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.\n\nIn essence, the rule replaces gray pixels unconditionally and replaces magenta pixels in corners, or adjacent to an \"L\" shape of other magenta pixels.\n"
