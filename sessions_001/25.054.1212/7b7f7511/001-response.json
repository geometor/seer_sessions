The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a reduction or cropping operation. The colors present are blue (1), green (3), and red (2). The output grid retains the spatial arrangement of colors from the input, but with reduced dimensions. The core operation seems to be a reduction of the width, and perhaps cropping to remove some columns.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
