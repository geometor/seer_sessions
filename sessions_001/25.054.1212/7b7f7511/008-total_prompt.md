## Example 2

**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
6 4 8 6 4 8
6 6 8 6 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC475874F0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
6 4 8
6 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47584D30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares (pixels), where each color corresponds to a numerical value. The input grid appears to be transformed into a smaller output grid by removing columns. The colors and their relative positions within the rows seem to be preserved during the transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid with dimensions 3x6 (rows x columns)
    elements:
      - row: 0
        values: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
      - row: 1
        values: [6, 4, 8, 6, 4, 8]
      - row: 2
        values: [6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8]

  - type: grid
    description: Output grid with dimensions 3x3 (rows x columns)
    elements:
      - row: 0
        values: [4, 4, 4]
      - row: 1
        values: [6, 4, 8]
      - row: 2
        values: [6, 6, 8]

  - observation: The output grid's rows match the input grid's rows.
  - observation: Columns are removed from the input grid to create output
  - observation: "The first, third and fifth columns appear to be selected to
    form the output"
  - action: column_removal
    parameters: [remove every other column, starting with the 2nd]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation extracts every other column from the input grid, starting from the first column. It's equivalent to keeping the first, third, fifth, etc. columns and discarding the rest. The remaining columns form the output grid, preserving the row structure.

More Concisely:

1.  Iterate through the columns of the input grid, starting with the first column (index 0).
2.  Select only columns with an odd index (0,2,4...)
3.  Construct a new grid using these selected columns, maintaining the original row order.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
