  - observation: Columns with white pixels in the input seem to relate to rows and colors in the output.
  - observation: example 3 output is correct - columns 4,8,9,13.
  - hypothesis: The presence of a white pixel in column 4 maps to output row 1 having color 8.
  - hypothesis: The presence of a white pixel in column 8 maps to output row 2 having color 2.
  - hypothesis: The presence of a white pixel in column 9 maps to output row 3 having color 4.
  - hypothesis: There may not always be a white pixel in each of these columns.
