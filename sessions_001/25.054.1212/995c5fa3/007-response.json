The arrangement appears to form a pattern.\n*   **Output:** A smaller grid (3x3) with three colors: green (3), yellow (4), and red (2). There's no immediately obvious spatial correspondence between the input and output grids.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to be a direct mapping of regions or shapes. It feels like a summarization or encoding of the input grid's properties. The output grid is significantly smaller, suggesting information compression or abstraction. The distinct colors and regular output structure hint at a counting or categorization mechanism.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
