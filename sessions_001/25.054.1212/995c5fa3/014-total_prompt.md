## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5
5 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5
5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=896x256 at 0x7BFC4757C7F0>

**output:**
```
8 8 8
2 2 2
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4757D990>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 14x4 grid of pixels, primarily gray (5) with some white (0) pixels.  The output is a 3x3 grid with azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels. It appears the output grid is summarizing or extracting information from regions within the input grid. The specific arrangement and colors in the output suggest a relationship to the positions of the white pixels within the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 14x4
    elements: pixels
    colors: [gray, white]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    colors: [azure, red, yellow]
  - observation: white_pixel_columns
    description: The columns containing white pixels in the input grid seem to correspond to the rows of the output grid
    details: Column 5, column 9, column 13
  - observation: row_mapping
    description: Mapping between the columns of white and the rows of the output.
    details:
      - column 5 -> row 1, color azure (8)
      - column 9 -> row 2, color red (2)
      - column 13 -> row 3, color yellow(4)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Scan the Input:** Examine the input grid and identify the columns that contain white (0) pixels.
2. **Column-to-Row Mapping:**  For each identified column containing white, map it to a corresponding row in the output grid:
    - The first column with a white pixel corresponds to output row 1.
    - The second column with a white pixel corresponds to output row 2.
    - The third column with a white pixel corresponds to output row 3.
3. **Assign Colors:** Assign a specific color to each output row based on a predefined mapping:
    - Row 1: Azure (8)
    - Row 2: Red (2)
    - Row 3: Yellow (4)
4. **Create Output:** Construct a 3x3 output grid. Fill all cells in each row of output with mapped color.

Essentially, the program detects the x-coordinates (columns) where white pixels appear. These x-coordinates are used to determine which rows of the output should be filled. The program uses a fixed mapping of white-containing columns to rows and associated colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
