The output is a 3x3 grid with azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels. It appears the output grid is summarizing or extracting information from regions within the input grid. The specific arrangement and colors in the output suggest a relationship to the positions of the white pixels within the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Fill all cells in each row of output with mapped color.\n\nEssentially, the program detects the x-coordinates (columns) where white pixels appear. These x-coordinates are used to determine which rows of the output should be filled. The program uses a fixed mapping of white-containing columns to rows and associated colors.\n"
