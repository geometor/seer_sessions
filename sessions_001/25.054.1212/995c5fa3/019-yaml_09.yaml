actions:
    - type: extract
      input:
        name: input_grid
        region:
          description: vertical lines
      output:  central_square #Hypothesis, the white lines appear important, as does the central square.

    - type: recolor_and_resize
      input: central_square, vertical_line locations #Hypothesis
      output: output_grid
      details: The output grid might derive its dimensions/structure from the location of the extracted central_square relative to the vertical_line
