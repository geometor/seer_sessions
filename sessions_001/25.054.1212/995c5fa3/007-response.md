Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A large grid (14x4) composed of two colors: gray (5) and white (0). The arrangement appears to form a pattern.
*   **Output:** A smaller grid (3x3) with three colors: green (3), yellow (4), and red (2). There's no immediately obvious spatial correspondence between the input and output grids.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to be a direct mapping of regions or shapes. It feels like a summarization or encoding of the input grid's properties. The output grid is significantly smaller, suggesting information compression or abstraction. The distinct colors and regular output structure hint at a counting or categorization mechanism.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 14x4
      colors: [0, 5]  # white, gray
    observations: |
      The grid contains horizontal rows.
      There are distinct horizontal bands of gray interrupted by white.

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [2, 3, 4]  # red, green, yellow
    observations: |
       The grid is a standard 3 by 3.
       All cells are assigned to a color.

actions:
  - type: count
    target: input_grid.rows
    condition: "containing white (0)"
    result: row_counts

  - type: assign_color
    target: output_grid.cells
    mapping:
      row_counts:
        1: 4 #yellow
        2: 3 #green
        3: 2 #red

relationships:
  - type: corresponds
    from: input_grid.row_counts
    to: output_grid.color_assignment
    description: The number of rows in the input grid with a color of 0 maps to colors of 2, 3, and 4 in the output grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid.
2.  **Count White:** Count the number of rows that contain at least one white (0) pixel.
3.  **Assign Output Colors:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Assign colors to the output cells based on these rules
    *   If three rows contain the color 0, fill the output grid as color 2
    *   If one row contain the color 0, fill the output grid as color 4.
    *   If two rows contain the color 0, fill the output grid as color 3.

Essentially, the program counts the occurrences of certain input feature and uses predefined rules to determine the output grid colors.
