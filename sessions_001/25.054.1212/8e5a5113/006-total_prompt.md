Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all vertical columns where all pixels are gray (value 5).
2.  **Segment:** Divide the input grid into sections. A section is a continuous block of columns between two separators, or between the edge of the grid and a separator.
3. **Reflect Sections:** For each section:
    *   Iterate through each row of the current section.
    *   Within that row, locate regions of white background.
    *   Perform horizontal reflection within a non-white region. For each pixel of a given color before the white "mirror" region, swap it with the corresponding pixel the same distance *after* the white region, within that row.

Essentially: the non-white regions are reflected over the white regions.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code correctly identified the gray separators and the concept of sections. However, the reflection logic within sections, specifically around white regions, is flawed. The code attempts a reflection, but it's not handling the indices and swapping correctly, resulting in no change being applied to the transformed output. The reflection needs to consider the white "mirror" as the central point and swap elements on either side.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Debug Reflection:** The core issue is in the `reflect_section` function. We need to carefully rethink the index calculations for swapping pixels across white regions within each row.
2.  **Simplify:** Focus on reflecting over the white spaces and not mixing the gray columns into the function.
3.  **Test Incrementally:** After fixing the reflection, test with various input grids

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1, 2, 3:**

    *   All the transforms were the same as the input, showing that the transform was not effective.
    *   **Pixels Off:** 18 in each case. This indicates a consistent error across all examples, likely due to incorrect reflection logic.
    *   **Size Correct:** True. The output grid size is the same as the input.
    *   **Color Palette Correct:** False. The colors did not change.
    *  **Correct Pixel Counts:** False.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: "Input grids are divided into sections by vertical gray columns."
    objects:
      - object_1: "Gray columns (value 5)"
        properties:
          - "Separator"
          - "Vertical"
      - object_2: "Sections"
        properties:
          - "Regions between gray columns"
  - description: "Within each section, white regions act as mirrors for reflection."
    objects:
      - object_1: "White regions (value 0)"
        properties:
          - "Mirror"
          - "Horizontal reflection point"
      - object_2: "Non-white pixels"
        properties:
            - subject_to_reflection: True
  - description: "Reflection occurs horizontally within each row of a section."
    actions:
      - action_1: "Horizontal reflection"
        details: "Pixels on either side of a white region are swapped symmetrically."
  - description: "Gray columns separator pixels are copied from input to output"
    action:
       - action_1: "copy gray column"
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all vertical columns where *all* pixels are gray (value 5).
2.  **Copy Separators:** Copy all gray separator columns from the input to the output.
3.  **Segment:** Divide the input grid into sections. A section is a continuous block of columns between two separators, or between the edge of the grid and a separator.
4.  **Reflect Sections:** For each section:
    *   Iterate through each row of the current section.
    *   Within that row, identify any white regions (contiguous blocks of white pixels).
    *   For each white region, treat it as a horizontal "mirror".
    *   Swap the pixels to the left of the mirror with the pixels to the right of the mirror over the mirror, such as to reflect those portions of the image.
5. **Assemble Output** Recombine the reflected sections and separator columns to form the final output grid. The separators should remain unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
