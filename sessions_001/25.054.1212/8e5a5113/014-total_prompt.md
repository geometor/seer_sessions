## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 7 8 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
7 7 8 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
8 8 8 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x7BFC4757DFF0>

**output:**
```
2 7 8 5 8 7 2 5 8 8 8
7 7 8 5 8 7 7 5 8 7 7
8 8 8 5 8 8 8 5 8 7 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x7BFC4757E410>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The colors involved seem to be consistent with the ARC color map. The primary change appears to be the introduction of a new block of pixels in the center, replacing some of the original pixels. The values and colors from the left and right sides are kept at their places.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11).
  - observation: |
      The first four columns of the input and output grids are identical.
  - observation: |
      The last three columns of input and output are identical.
  - observation: |
    The central 3 columns in output seem to be a combination of mirroring of the left and right sides,
    in a specific sequence and alternating colors.
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 11
      colors: [red, orange, azure, gray, white]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 11
      colors: [red, orange, azure, gray, white]
  - action: copy_columns
    description: |
      Columns 0-3 of the input grid are copied to columns 0-3 of the output grid.
  - action: copy_columns
    description: |
      Columns 8-10 of the input are copied to columns 8-10 of the output.
  - action: sequence
    description: |
      Columns 4, 5, and 6, follow a predefined sequence based on column 3 and
      column 7 reversed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Initial Columns:** Copy the first four columns (index 0 to 3) of the input grid directly to the output grid.
2.  **Copy Final Columns:** Copy the last three columns (index 8 to 10) of the input grid directly to the output grid.
3.  **Sequence Columns:** Create columns 4, 5 and 6 in output, using the following.
    *   Column 4 is set to column 3.
    *   Column 5 is set to column 7 reversed.
    *   Column 6 is set to column 3 reversed.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
