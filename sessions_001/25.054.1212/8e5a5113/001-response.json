The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11 in this example). The transformation appears to involve a combination of color changes and potentially some spatial rearrangement or mirroring, although that's not entirely clear from the output given. I see there's a group of gray pixels (value 5) and white (value 0). The other objects are blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

These columns act as separators or fixed points within the grid.\n2.  **Segment:** Divide the input grid into three distinct sections based on the gray columns: a section to the left of the first gray column, a section between the two gray columns, and section to the right of the second gray column.\n3. **Left Section Reflection**: Within the section left of the first gray column, perform a horizontal mirroring. The reflection plane seems to be a transformation of the white cells, where, for example, the yellow cells occupy the white spaces.\n4. **Middle Section Reflection:** Similarly, the area between the two gray columns appears to be have a reflection plane in what was the white area.\n5. **Right Section Reflection:** Finally, the section right of the final gray section also seems to have a reflection plan in what was previously the white area.\n\nEssentially, what was the white region gets converted into \"mirror\" and the color of the input objects swap places with the colors of their reflections.\n\n"
