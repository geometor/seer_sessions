## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 2 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
4 1 1 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
4 4 1 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x7BFC475006D0>

**output:**
```
1 1 2 5 4 4 1 5 1 4 4
4 1 1 5 4 1 1 5 1 1 4
4 4 1 5 1 1 2 5 2 1 1
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11 in this example). The transformation appears to involve a combination of color changes and potentially some spatial rearrangement or mirroring, although that's not entirely clear from the output given. I see there's a group of gray pixels (value 5) and white (value 0). The other objects are blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Colors in the input grid are: blue (1), red (2), yellow (4), gray (5), and white (0).
  - observation: |
      Output grid contains the same colors.
  - observation: |
     There is a vertical section of gray (value 5) in column 4 and column 8.
  - observation: |
     The gray may divide the input and output grid into two sections.
  - observation: |
     The white region (value 0) exists only before transformation.
  - relation: |
      The gray (5) columns in input and output align.
  - action: |
      white (0) pixels become a reflection plane for the left and right objects.
  - action:
      Colors change between input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Locate the vertical columns of gray (5) pixels. These columns act as separators or fixed points within the grid.
2.  **Segment:** Divide the input grid into three distinct sections based on the gray columns: a section to the left of the first gray column, a section between the two gray columns, and section to the right of the second gray column.
3. **Left Section Reflection**: Within the section left of the first gray column, perform a horizontal mirroring. The reflection plane seems to be a transformation of the white cells, where, for example, the yellow cells occupy the white spaces.
4. **Middle Section Reflection:** Similarly, the area between the two gray columns appears to be have a reflection plane in what was the white area.
5. **Right Section Reflection:** Finally, the section right of the final gray section also seems to have a reflection plan in what was previously the white area.

Essentially, what was the white region gets converted into "mirror" and the color of the input objects swap places with the colors of their reflections.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
