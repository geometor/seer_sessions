The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11). The colors in the input grid seem to be replaced or filled based on some rule related to their spatial arrangement and possibly their initial colors. A notable change is that the white (0) areas in the input are replaced with a seemingly patterned arrangement of magenta (6), green (3) and red(2) in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
