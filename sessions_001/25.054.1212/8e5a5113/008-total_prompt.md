## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 3 3 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
6 3 3 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
6 3 2 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x7BFC47578A30>

**output:**
```
6 3 3 5 6 6 6 5 2 3 6
6 3 3 5 3 3 3 5 3 3 6
6 3 2 5 2 3 3 5 3 3 6
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x11). The colors in the input grid seem to be replaced or filled based on some rule related to their spatial arrangement and possibly their initial colors. A notable change is that the white (0) areas in the input are replaced with a seemingly patterned arrangement of magenta (6), green (3) and red(2) in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x11
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: input_grid
    description: Initial state of the grid
  - observation: output_grid
    description: Transformed state of the grid
  - relationship: same_dimensions
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - action: color_replacement
    description: Pixels of certain colors in the input grid are replaced with different colors in the output grid.
  - pattern: color_fill
    description: White (0) pixels in the input are replaced based on neighboring colors and existing color pattern in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** The output grid starts as a copy of the input grid.

2.  **Color Filling:** Scan the input grid.
    *   Identify all white (0) pixels.
    *   For each white pixel:
        * Check the right most non-zero pixel to the left in the same row, if that pixel is gray(5) then,
        * The white region is filled starting from the left with magenta(6),green(3) and red(2) and, if adjacent, repeated until the end of the white region.

3. **Final output:** The modified grid after the application of above mentioned rules is the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
