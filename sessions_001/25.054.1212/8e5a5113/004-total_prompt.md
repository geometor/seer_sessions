Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Columns:** Locate the vertical columns of gray (5) pixels. These columns act as separators or fixed points within the grid.
2.  **Segment:** Divide the input grid into three distinct sections based on the gray columns: a section to the left of the first gray column, a section between the two gray columns, and section to the right of the second gray column.
3. **Left Section Reflection**: Within the section left of the first gray column, perform a horizontal mirroring. The reflection plane seems to be a transformation of the white cells, where, for example, the yellow cells occupy the white spaces.
4. **Middle Section Reflection:** Similarly, the area between the two gray columns appears to be have a reflection plane in what was the white area.
5. **Right Section Reflection:** Finally, the section right of the final gray section also seems to have a reflection plan in what was previously the white area.

Essentially, what was the white region gets converted into "mirror" and the color of the input objects swap places with the colors of their reflections.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of identifying gray columns as separators and reflecting sections based on white "mirror" planes was partially correct in its conceptualization but flawed in its execution. The code successfully identifies the gray separators but fails to correctly implement the reflection logic. It seems to be copying the original input sections without performing the intended reflection, leading to outputs that are identical to the inputs in the reflected areas. The core issue is in the `reflect_section` function, which doesn't swap pixels across the inferred reflection line correctly.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct the Reflection Logic:** The `reflect_section` function needs to accurately swap pixel values across the white "mirror" plane. This means if a colored pixel is 'x' distance from the start of the white area, its reflected counterpart should be 'x' distance from the end of the white area, within each row, and colors should be maintained.
2.  **Test and Iterate:** After fixing the reflection logic, we need to re-run the tests on all training examples. This iterative process of code modification and validation is crucial.
3. **Simplify the language:** Remove the comments and reword the algorithm to be more concise.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of the metrics of the provided code:

*   **Correct Gray Column Identification:** All three examples show the gray columns are correctly identified.
*   **Incorrect Reflection:** In all three examples, the output grid is identical to the input grid in the non-gray-column sections. This indicates the core reflection logic is not working as intended, and is merely copying.
*   **Consistent Error:** The error is consistent across all examples, suggesting a fundamental flaw in the reflection implementation rather than an edge-case issue.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: "002"
  - objects:
      - type: "grid"
        properties:
            - contains: "pixels"
            - values: "integers 0-9 representing colors"
      - type: "separator"
        properties:
            - color: "gray (5)"
            - shape: "vertical column"
      - type: "section"
        properties:
          - description: "region between separators"
      - type: "mirror plane"
        properties:
          - description: "white colored region within each section"
  - actions:
      - name: "identify_separators"
        description: "Locate gray columns in the grid."
      - name: "segment_grid"
        description: "Divide the grid into sections based on separator locations."
      - name: "reflect_section"
        description: "Reflect a section horizontally across a white colored region acting as the mirror plane."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all vertical columns where all pixels are gray (value 5).
2.  **Segment:** Divide the input grid into sections. A section is a continuous block of columns between two separators, or between the edge of the grid and a separator.
3. **Reflect Sections:** For each section:
    *   Iterate through each row of the current section.
    *   Within that row, locate regions of white background.
    *   Perform horizontal reflection within a non-white region. For each pixel of a given color before the white "mirror" region, swap it with the corresponding pixel the same distance *after* the white region, within that row.

Essentially: the non-white regions are reflected over the white regions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
