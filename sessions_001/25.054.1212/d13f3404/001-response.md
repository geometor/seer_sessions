Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The input grid contains colored pixels, some of which are blank (white, value 0). The output grid seems to expand the non-zero pixels of the input grid diagonally downwards and to the right, creating a sequence of the non-zero input pixels. The colors in the sequence maintain the initial order from top left in input. The expansion continues until the diagonal hits the edge. The rest fill with 0.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: magenta (6)
        position: [0,0]
      - color: blue (1)
        position: [0,1]
      - color: white (0)
        position: [0,2]
      - color: green (3)
        position: [1,0]
      - color: white (0)
        position: [1,1]
      - color: white (0)
        position: [1,2]
      - color: white (0)
        position: [2,0]
      - color: white (0)
        position: [2,1]
      - color: white (0)
        position: [2,2]
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements:
      - description: diagonal sequence of non-zero input pixels, starting from top-left
  - observation: input grid is expanded into output grid
  - observation: Non-zero pixels are propagated diagonally.
  - observation: The color and relative order of non-zero input pixels are preserved
  - observation: Empty cells are filled with color white(0)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Scan the input grid (3x3) and identify all pixels with a non-zero value. Maintain their original color and relative order.
2.  **Initialize Output Grid:** Create an empty output grid (6x6) filled with zeros (white).
3.  **Diagonal Expansion:** For each non-zero pixel identified in step 1, start placing them in the output grid diagonally.
    *   The first non-zero pixel from the input goes to position (0, 0) in the output.
    *   For each subsequent pixel, shift one position down and one position to the right in the output grid.
    *   Continue the diagonal placement, preserving the original order and color of non zero colors found in step 1.
4.  **Fill Remaining Cells**: If diagonal expansion encounters any boundary before all non-zero pixels are placed, continue placing the colors from the input diagonally. Fill the remaining, empty cells with white color (value 0).
