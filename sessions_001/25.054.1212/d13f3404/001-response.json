The input grid contains colored pixels, some of which are blank (white, value 0). The output grid seems to expand the non-zero pixels of the input grid diagonally downwards and to the right, creating a sequence of the non-zero input pixels. The colors in the sequence maintain the initial order from top left in input. The expansion continues until the diagonal hits the edge. The rest fill with 0.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
