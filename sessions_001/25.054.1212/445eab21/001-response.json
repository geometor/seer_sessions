The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: orange (7) and azure (8), surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid consists solely of azure (8) pixels, arranged in a 2x2 square. The output appears to be a simplified representation of a feature extracted from the input. The orange shape and white background in the input are not present in the output.
