## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7BFC4890A380>

**output:**
```
8 8
8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC47500F40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: orange (7) and azure (8), surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid consists solely of azure (8) pixels, arranged in a 2x2 square. The output appears to be a simplified representation of a feature extracted from the input. The orange shape and white background in the input are not present in the output. The specific shape of the azure pixels is maintained in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 7, 8]
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - regions:
          - color: 7
            shape: irregular, L-shaped
          - color: 8
            shape: irregular, mirrored L-shaped
          - color: 0
            shape: background
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [8]
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - regions:
          - color: 8
            shape: square

  - action: extract_object
    input: input_grid
    parameters:
      - target_color: 8
      - operation: find_bounding_box #inferred bounding box of the target color
    output: output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target object:** Locate the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine the bounding box:** Find the smallest rectangle that completely encloses the azure region.
3.  **Extract the bounding box:** Create a new grid containing only the pixels within the determined bounding box. In this example, the bounding box of the azure object is a 2 x 2 square.
4.  Present only the bounding box in the new grid, forming the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
