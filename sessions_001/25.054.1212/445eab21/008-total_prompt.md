## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0
6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0

0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x640 at 0x7BFC4423C6A0>

**output:**
```
7 7
7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC4423CC10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid contains two distinct objects, one magenta (6) and one orange (7), against a white (0) background.  The magenta object appears to be a partial rectangle or L-shape in the top left corner. The orange object is a larger, filled rectangle located below the magenta object. The output is a small 2x2 square composed entirely of the orange (7) color. It appears that the core concept is to extract a representation of one object (in orange) from input and disregard other colors and objects, like magenta object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: obj1
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: partial rectangle/L-shape
    position: top-left
    details: Extends to the fourth row and fifth column, incomplete shape.
  - id: obj2
    color: orange (7)
    shape: filled rectangle
    position: bottom-center
    details:  Starts on the sixth row, leaving space from top. Inner part is hollow.
  - id: obj3
    color: orange (7)
    shape: filled 2x2 square
    position: output
    details:  Smallest representation of color 7.

background:
  color: white (0)

actions:
  - type: extraction
    target: obj2
    details: Isolate a representative sub-component of the orange object.
  - type: simplification
    target: obj2
    details: Reduce the selected orange object part to smallest 2x2 square.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: [obj1, obj2]
    details: obj1 is above obj2, no overlap

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find the orange (value 7) object within the input grid.
2.  **Extract Representative:** Extract the smallest possible 2x2 square composed entirely of the orange color (7).
3.  **Output:** Present this extracted 2x2 orange square as the output. Disregard all other objects and colors in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
