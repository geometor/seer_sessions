The magenta object appears to be a partial rectangle or L-shape in the top left corner. The orange object is a larger, filled rectangle located below the magenta object. The output is a small 2x2 square composed entirely of the orange (7) color. It appears that the core concept is to extract a representation of one object (in orange) from input and disregard other colors and objects, like magenta object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
