The new small object appears nearby.\n    *   Blue(1) objects might be removed, they could become white(0), or they could be reduced in size. It looks like the transformation of blue objects might depend on their positions in the grid.\n    *   If an object with color 8 is nearby an object with color 6, combine these objects using color 6 for all pixels.\n    *   Red(2) objects may remain the same or they could be moved.\n    *   Green(3) objects remain unchanged.\n\n3.  **Output Size**: The height and width of the output are the sizes of the largest contiguous sections of non-zero pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous blocks of the same color in a grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, object_pixels):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        object_pixels.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, object_pixels)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, object_pixels)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, object_pixels)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, object_pixels)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[row, col]:\n                color = grid[row, col]\n                object_pixels = []\n                dfs(row, col, color, object_pixels)\n                if object_pixels:\n                    objects.append({'color': color, 'pixels': object_pixels})\n    return objects\n\ndef get_bounding_box(pixels):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bounding box of a set of pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not pixels:\n        return None\n    rows, cols = zip(*pixels)\n    min_row, max_row = min(rows), max(rows)\n    min_col, max_col = min(cols), max(cols)\n    return (min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col)\n\ndef is_nearby(obj1_pixels, obj2_pixels, threshold=2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two objects are nearby based on their pixel coordinates.\n    Using a simple distance check between bounding box edges.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not obj1_pixels or not obj2_pixels:\n        return False\n    \n    box1 = get_bounding_box(obj1_pixels)\n    box2 = get_bounding_box(obj2_pixels)\n    \n    dist_row = max(0, max(box1[0], box2[0]) - min(box1[2], box2[2]))\n    dist_col = max(0, max(box1[1], box2[1]) - min(box1[3], box2[3]))\n\n    return dist_row <= threshold and dist_col <= threshold\n\ndef get_output_grid_size(objects):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determine the size of the output grid.
