## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 5 1 5 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3
0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x192 at 0x7BFC4757B040>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 3
0 2 1 1 1 3 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x7BFC4757BFA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a combination of color changes and object manipulation. There's a notion of "objects" as contiguous blocks of the same color. Certain colors in the input are replaced by others. Grey (5) seems important as it may be getting converted to another color, or being removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns: 11
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: variable
      shape: variable
      position: variable
  - type: transformation
    properties:
       color_change: [5->1, 1->0]
       object_removal: grey
    
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color as distinct objects.
2.  **Color Replacement:**
    *   Replace all instances of grey (5) with blue (1).
    *   Replace all instances of blue (1) with white(0).
3. **Preserve other blocks**: keep red(2) and green(3) unchanged.
.

In summary, the input grid is processed by taking gray, replacing them with blue, which are in turn replace with white.. Red and green colored blocks remain, the white space remains.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
