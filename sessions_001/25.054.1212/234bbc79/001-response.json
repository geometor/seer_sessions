Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The grids appear to be smaller versions of the JPEGs provided. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid and changes in the values of certain pixels. The most prominent change is the replacement of 5s with other colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, the output grid has 7 columns while the input has 9. Columns are removed. The rule to determine which columns are removed is not immediately obvious, but it's consistent across the example: columns 3 and 6 of the *input* are removed (counting from 0).\n\n2.  **Color Replacement (5s):** All pixels with a value of '5' (gray) in the input grid are changed.\n\n3.  **Replacement Logic:**\n    *   Input '5' pixels directly above or below a '1' (blue) become '1' (blue).\n    *   Input '5' pixels adjacent to a '2' (red) become '2'(red) if the '5' is at the edge and a '2' exist.\n\n4.  **Other Pixels:** Pixels that are not '5' in the input grid retain their original values in the output grid, maintaining relative position after column removal.\n"
