The transformation seems to involve a combination of color changes and object manipulation. There's a notion of \"objects\" as contiguous blocks of the same color. Certain colors in the input are replaced by others. Grey (5) seems important as it may be getting converted to another color, or being removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
