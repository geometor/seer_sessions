Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code's core logic of duplicating columns is partially correct. However, the duplication isn't consistently applied across all examples, and the order of the duplicated columns is incorrect in some cases. The error seems to stem from a misunderstanding of *how* the columns are reordered and duplicated. The strategy should be to revisualize and precisely define the column reordering/duplication. It looks like the intent is a mirrored duplication of the columns, not a simple repeat of each column.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's analyze each example to clarify the pattern:

*   **Example 1:** Input `6 6 6; 1 6 1; 8 8 6`. Expected: `6 6 6 6 6 6; 1 6 1 1 6 1; 8 8 6 6 8 8`.  The output should contain two copies of the input, mirrored.
*   **Example 2:** Input `6 8 1; 6 1 1; 1 1 6`. Expected: `6 8 1 1 8 6; 6 1 1 1 1 6; 1 1 6 6 1 1`. This confirms the mirroring. The last column becomes next to last, second to last becomes second, etc.
*   **Example 3:** Input `1 1 1; 8 1 6; 6 8 8`. Expected: `1 1 1 1 1 1; 8 1 6 6 1 8; 6 8 8 8 8 6`. Mirrored again.
*   **Example 4:** Input `1 1 1; 1 6 6; 6 6 6`. Expected: `1 1 1 1 1 1; 1 6 6 6 6 1; 6 6 6 6 6 6`. Mirrored.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

```yaml
task: 002
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [1, 6, 8] # Example-specific, update for each
      dimensions: [rows, cols] # Variable dimensions
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [1, 6, 8] # Example-specific
      dimensions: [rows, cols * 2]
actions:
  - type: mirror_duplicate_columns
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Each column in the input grid is duplicated and mirrored to create the output grid. The order of columns is reversed during the duplication.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Take the input grid.
2.  **Mirror Columns:** Create a mirrored copy of the input columns. This means reversing the order of the columns and then appending this reversed sequence to the original sequence of columns.
3.  **Output:**  The output grid consists of the original columns followed by the reversed columns.

Another, perhaps clearer way to put it:

1. Take the input grid
2. Reverse the order of the columns
3. Append the reversed columns to the original columns.
4. Return the combined grid.
