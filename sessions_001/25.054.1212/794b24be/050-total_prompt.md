## Example 9

**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 1 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47586320>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47584340>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid, where each cell contains a single digit integer. The input grid appears to contain values 0 and 1. The corresponding output grid contains values of 0 and 2. The general layout, dimensions and structure appear identical with the cell as the unit of change. The key difference seems to be a change of color of some cells.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0, 1 in input; 0, 2 in output)
  - object: cell
    properties:
      value: integer
      color: mapped to integer value (0: white, 1: blue, 2: red)
  - action: value_change
    description: Some cells change their integer value.
    details:
        - '1' in input changes to '2' in output.
        - '0' in input stays as '0' in output.
  - relationship: cell_correspondence
    description: Each cell in the input grid corresponds directly to the same position cell in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Iteration:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   **Conditional Value Change:**
        *   If the cell's value is 1, change it to 2 in the corresponding output cell.
        *   If the cell's value is 0, keep it as 0 in the corresponding output cell.
3.  **Output:** The transformed grid is the output.

In essence, the program replaces all occurrences of '1' (blue) with '2' (red), while leaving '0' (white) unchanged. The spatial arrangement is preserved.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
