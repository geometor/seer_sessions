## Example 8

**input:**
```
1 1 0
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890A3B0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4890AE00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains values 0 and 1 (representing white and blue colors, respectively). The output grid contains values 0 and 2 (representing white and red colors, respectively). The transformation seems to involve replacing some, but not all, of the non-zero values in the input with the value 2, while some zeros are retained and others might be replaced. The key is to discern which input pixels corresponding to 1's change to 2's and which 0's stay the same.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 1]
    element_colors: {0: white, 1: blue}
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 2]
    element_colors: {0: white, 2: red}
  - observation: input_blue_becomes_output_red
    input_value: 1
    output_value: 2
  - observation: some_input_white_remains_white
    input_value: 0
    output_value: 0
  - action: replace_value
    description: Certain elements in the input grid are replaced based on a rule.
  - relationship: spatial_correspondence
    description: Each element in the input grid corresponds to the element at the same position in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Blue to Red Transformation:** Iterate through each cell in the input grid. If a cell's value is 1 (blue), change it to 2 (red) in the corresponding location in the output grid.
3.  **White Retention or change :** if a cell's value is 0 (white):
        - If the cell is surrounded by any cells that have value 2(red), keep the cell's value as 0 in the output grid.
        - If the cell is not surrounded by any cell that has a value 2(red), then change it to 0 in the output grid.
4. **Output:** output the resulting grid.

More succinctly : Change all 1s to 2s. Leave 0s as they are.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
