## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475A1810>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4757CEE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grid seems to retain the dimensions but changes some pixels to red (2) and keeps others as white (0). The blue pixels are replaced, and their original horizontal position appears to be significant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors white (0) and blue (1).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors white (0) and red (2).
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      cells: pixels with color values
  - action: Replace blue pixels based on their horizontal position.
  - relationship: Blue pixels in the first column become Red.
  - relationship: Blue pixels in second column become red.
  - relationship: all other pixels will be white.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input 3x3 grid.
2.  **Transformation:**
    *   Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
    *   Check if the value of input is blue(1)
    *   If the cell is blue and the cell is in the first or second horizontal position (column index 0 or 1), change its value to red (2) in the output grid.
    *   Otherwise, set the value of output grid to white (0)
3.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.

In essence, the program replaces blue pixels with red pixels only if they are located in the first two columns, all the other pixels, including existing white pixels, will be turned to white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
