observations:
  - task: 026
    objects:
      - id: 1
        color: blue
        description: contiguous block of blue pixels
        behavior: becomes red, maintains shape and size
      - id: 2
        color: red
        description: contiguous block of red pixels
        behavior: replaces blue, maintains shape and size of original blue block

    transformations:
      - type: color_change
        from: blue
        to: red
        scope: all blue pixels are transformed to red pixels
      - type: value_change
        from: not zero
        to: zero
        scope: all non-zero, non-blue pixels in the input go away
    relationships:
       - all blue is contiguous

    grid:
      dimensions: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30
      background: white (0), black (0)
