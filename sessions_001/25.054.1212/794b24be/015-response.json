            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code only considered the first example, where a single blue pixel was turned red, and white pixels remained white. The subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern. The transformation isn't simply changing individual blue pixels to red. Instead, it appears to be related to the *position* and *connectivity* of blue pixels. It looks like a blue pixel turns red and any white pixels that are to the right, in the same row, AND before any other non-white, non-blue pixels.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The initial assumption (blue becomes red) is too simplistic. We need to consider the spatial relationships between pixels.\n2.  **Focus on Connectivity:** Analyze how blue pixels relate to other pixels in their row.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Develop a new natural language program, encode it, test it, and adjust based on the results.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on relevant details:\n\n*   **Example 1:** One blue pixel. It correctly turns red. Any white pixels to the right in the same row, before other non-white colors, should also turn red, but there are none.\n*   **Example 2:** Two blue pixels on separate rows. They each turns red, and any white pixels to the right, before non-white colors, turn red.\n*   **Example 3:** Two blue pixels in separate corners, so no white pixels to the right in the same row. They each turns red, any white pixels to the right, before other non-white pixels, should turn red.\n*   **Example 4:** Similar to 2 and 3 - Blue pixels in a row, and any intervening white pixels to the right in the same row, but before other colors, should turn red.\n*   **Example 5:** Similar to 3 - Only a single blue pixel, which turns red, along with any white pixels to the right, before other colors, should turn red.\n*   **Example 6:** Multiple blue pixels, some adjacent. All blue and white pixels to the right, and before other colors, should turn red.\n*   **Example 7:** All blue pixels turn red and contiguous white pixels after blue turn red.\n*   **Example 8:** The first two blue pixels are horizontal and turns the two blue and intervening white pixel red. The single blue pixel on the bottom is correctly turned red.\n*   **Example 9:** Similar to 7. Blue pixels and intervening white pixels turn red.\n*   **Example 10:** A more complex scenario, helping to define rules. All horizontal blue pixels turn red.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: pixel\n    properties:\n      color:\n        - white (0)\n        - blue (1)\n        - red (2)\n      position: [row, column]\n\nactions:\n  - name: transform_color\n    conditions:\n      - if pixel is blue: change to red\n      - if pixel is white AND is to the right of a blue or red pixel in same row, before any non-white, non-blue pixels: change to red.\n    result: pixel color changes\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.\n2.  Within each row, iterate through the pixels from left to right.\n3.  If a pixel is blue, change it to red in the output grid.\n4. If a pixel is white, check if there is a blue pixel or converted red pixel to the left in the same row, AND it is before any non-white, non-blue pixel. If true, change the white pixel to red in the output grid.\n5.  If a pixel is any other color, and a blue pixel has been encountered, stop processing.\n6.  All other pixels remain unchanged.\n"
