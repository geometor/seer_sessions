The input grid contains values 0 and 1 (representing white and blue colors, respectively). The output grid contains values 0 and 2 (representing white and red colors, respectively). The transformation seems to involve replacing some, but not all, of the non-zero values in the input with the value 2, while some zeros are retained and others might be replaced. The key is to discern which input pixels corresponding to 1's change to 2's and which 0's stay the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
