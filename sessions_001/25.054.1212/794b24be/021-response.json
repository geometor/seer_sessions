            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were too simplistic. While it correctly identified the change of blue (1) to red (2), it failed to account for the spatial relationships and the \"shifting\" of the transformation based on the position of the blues. The current code simply replaces all blues with reds, wherever they are. The expected outputs show a clear pattern: the red replaces the top left most blue, and all blues to its right.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n\n1.  Analyze the examples to pinpoint the exact rule governing the blue-to-red transformation. The key seems to be identifying the \"top-leftmost\" blue pixel.\n2.  Refine the natural language program to accurately capture this rule.\n3. Adapt the previous code to correctly perform the top left most transformation\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of the results, focusing on relevant details:\n\n| Example | Input Size | Output Size | Top-Left Blue (Input) | Top-Left Red (Output)|Zero's| Other colors|\n| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |----|----|\n| 1       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (1,0)                  | (0,0)                   |yes|no|\n| 2       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,1)                  | (0,0)              |yes|no|\n| 3       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,2)                  | (0,0)            |yes|no|\n| 4       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,1)                  | (0,0)       |yes|no|\n| 5       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,2)                  | (0,0)              |yes|no|\n| 6       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,0)                  | (0,0)                    |yes|no|\n| 7       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,1)                  | (0,0)                  |yes|no|\n| 8       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,0)                  | (0,0)                  |yes|no|\n| 9       | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,1)                  | (0,0)               |yes|no|\n| 10      | 3x3        | 3x3         | (0,0)                  | (0,0)                      |yes|no|\n\nKey Observations:\n\n*   All examples have the same input and output size (3x3).\n*   The color palette is limited to 0, 1 and 2 in I/O.\n*   All 0s are moved down one row.\n*   The number of 2s in the output is always equal to the total number of 1s in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 020\nfacts:\n  - object_types:\n      - pixel:\n          properties:\n            color: [0, 1, 2]  # white, blue, red\n            position: (row, col)\n  - transformations:\n      - find_top_left_blue:\n          input: grid of pixels\n          action: >\n            Locate the blue (1) pixel that is furthest to the top and\n            furthest to the left, if there are more than one on the same row,\n            choose the left-most\n          output: (row, col) of the top-left blue pixel, or None if no blue pixel exists\n      - replace_and_shift:\n          input: grid of pixels, top_left_blue_position\n          action: >\n            1.

Change all 0s to 2s\n          output: modified grid of pixels\n  - spatial_relationships:\n      - adjacency: Important for determining the top-left blue.\n      - row_major_order: Used implicitly when searching for the top-left.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find the Top-Left Blue:** Iterate through the input grid, row by row. The first blue (1) pixel encountered is the \"top-left blue\". Record its row and column.\n2. **Move Zeroes:** Move all zeroes (0) down one row\n3.  **Transform Blues:**\n    *   If no blue pixel was found, skip this step.\n    * replace all 1's with 2's, starting at column 0 of the top row, and\n      proceeding to the end of the row.\n4. **Output Grid:** Return a new grid that reflects all of these changes\n\nThis refined program directly addresses the \"shifting\" behavior observed in the examples, which the previous version missed. The critical addition is finding a \"top-left\" blue pixel and using its position to guide the transformations.\n"
