            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was too simplistic. It only considered replacing a *single* blue pixel with a red one. The test results clearly show that *all* blue pixels must be changed to red, and furthermore, *all* the blue pixels form a contiguous block in the input and must become red.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  Correctly identify all blue pixels, not just the first one.\n2.  Change all identified blue pixels to red.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of observations based on the code execution results. We'll analyze the color changes, spatial relationships, and object properties.\n\n*   **Consistent Transformation:**  In all \"Expected Output\" examples, all blue pixels (1) in the input are replaced by red pixels (2). The rest of the grid goes to all zeros, so it is white.\n*    **Object Persistence:** A blue \"object\", defined as contiguous blue pixels is being turned into a red \"object\" of identical size and shape.\n*   **Color Palette:** Only colors 0, 1, and 2 are used.\n* **Connectivity** Blue is always connected.\n\n**YAML Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 026\n    objects:\n      - id: 1\n        color: blue\n        description: contiguous block of blue pixels\n        behavior: becomes red, maintains shape and size\n      - id: 2\n        color: red\n        description: contiguous block of red pixels\n        behavior: replaces blue, maintains shape and size of original blue block\n\n    transformations:\n      - type: color_change\n        from: blue\n        to: red\n        scope: all blue pixels are transformed to red pixels\n      - type: value_change\n        from: not zero\n        to: zero\n        scope: all non-zero, non-blue pixels in the input go away\n    relationships:\n       - all blue is contiguous\n\n    grid:\n      dimensions: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30\n      background: white (0), black (0)\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels with the value 1 (blue) in the input grid.\n2.  **Transform:** Change the value of all identified blue pixels to 2 (red).\n3. **Clear** Change all other non-zero, non-blue cells to zero.\n\n"
