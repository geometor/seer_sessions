"""
1. Find the Top-Left Blue: Iterate through the input grid, row by row. The first blue (1) pixel encountered is the "top-left blue". Record its row and column.
2. Move Zeroes: Move all zeroes (0) down one row
3. Transform Blues:
    *   If no blue pixel was found, skip this step.
    * replace all 1's with 2's, starting at column 0 of the top row, and
      proceeding to the end of the row.
4. Output Grid: Return a new grid that reflects all of these changes

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
