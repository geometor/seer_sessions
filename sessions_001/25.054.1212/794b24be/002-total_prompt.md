## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475A1DE0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47578EE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a single colored pixel (blue, represented by the value '1') at position (1,0). The other pixels are white (value '0'). The output grid shifts this colored pixel to position (0,0) and changes its color to red (value '2'). All other pixels remain white. The primary operation appears to be a change in position and value of a single, non-zero pixel.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        value_range: 0-9
        initial_state_input:
          position: (1,0)
          value: 1
          color: blue
        final_state_output:
          position: (0,0)
          value: 2
          color: red
      - type: pixel
        value: 0
        color: white
        state: unchanged

  - type: transformation
    description: "Single non-zero pixel changes position and value."
    action:
      - move_pixel:
          from: (1,0)
          to: (0,0)
      - change_value:
          from: 1
          to: 2
      - change_color:
          from: blue
          to: red
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single non-zero pixel in the input grid.
2.  Move the pixel to the top-left corner (position 0,0).
3.  Change the pixel's value from 1 to 2.
4.  Change the color of the pixel from blue to red, and keep all white pixels the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
