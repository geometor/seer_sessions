The input grid contains pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grid also contains pixels of potentially two colors: white (0) and red (2), but in this specific instance, we only see white and red where previously there was blue. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The transformation seems to involve a color change based on color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
