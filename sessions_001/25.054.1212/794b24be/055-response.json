The input grid contains values of 0 and 1, representing white and blue pixels, respectively. The output grid contains values of 0 and 2, representing white and red pixels, respectively. The transformation seems to involve a change in color based on the initial color and possibly its position or neighbors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
