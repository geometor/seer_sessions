## Example 6

**input:**
```
1 1 0
0 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47544220>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains values 0 and 1 (white and blue), while the output grid contains values 0 and 2 (white and red). The transformation seems to involve changing some specific values based on their initial color and position, but there might be more complex logic.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: numerical values (0, 1 in input; 0, 2 in output)
    description: Represents a 2D array of pixels.

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        input:
            0: white
            1: blue
        output:
            0: white
            2: red
      position: (row, column)
    description: An individual cell within the grid.

actions:
    - name: transform_color
      input_object: pixel
      parameters: original_color
      output_object: pixel with updated color

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a grid, with defined row and column positions.
    elements:
      - adjacent: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
      - row_based: changes can relate to a row
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** If a pixel's value is 1 (blue) **and** it is located in the first row of the input grid, change its value to 2 (red) in the output grid.
3.  **Check** If the pixel has value of 1 (blue) and is located in the last row, the value in the output will be 0 (white)
4.  **Else**, keep the original value of the pixel (0, white) unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
