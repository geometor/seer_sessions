The larger grid contains a central \"shape\" composed of non-zero colored pixels, surrounded by zero-valued (white) pixels. The smaller grid seems to extract a portion of this central shape. The colors and their spatial relationships are preserved in the output.  The output grid appears to capture the top-left \"corner\" of the central object where a non-white pixel exists. The size of the output (3 x 3) may be constant.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
