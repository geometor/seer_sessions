Each pixel has a numerical value representing a color. In this specific example, we see two colors: '2' (red) and '0' (white). The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve changing some of the '2' (red) pixels to '0' (white) pixels, and vice-versa, in a specific pattern. The primary object is the grid itself, and the pixels within it are sub-objects that are manipulated.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
