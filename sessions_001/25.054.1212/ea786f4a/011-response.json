            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too simplistic. It correctly identified the frame and the central pixel but incorrectly inverted *all* non-zero pixels on the frame to zero, and did not make the frame pixels adjacent to non-zero pixels inside the frame also zero. The expected outputs show a more nuanced transformation: the frame is inverted, such that non-zero colors become 0, but also the pixels *adjacent* to the frame elements are also changed to 0. The central pixel remains unchanged.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly define the \"frame\" and \"center pixel\" as distinct objects.\n2. **Enhance Action Description:** The action is not just inverting the frame. It's inverting colors (from non-zero to zero) on the frame AND the pixels *adjacent* to the non-zero frame elements.\n3. **Iterative Improvement:** Use the provided examples to iteratively refine the natural language program.  The first program clearly doesn't handle cases where the frame and its adjacent pixels have differing non-zero values.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Mismatched Pixels: Four corner pixels which are supposed to change to zero. The center pixel remains unchanged.\n    *    Pixels that should change to zero (input): `(0,0)=1`, `(0,2)=1`, `(2,0)=1`, `(2,2)=1`\n    *   Pixels that should change to zero (actual): all frame pixels were changed.\n    *   Observation: the code inverts the entire frame, but does not check for adjacent pixels to make zero.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Mismatched Pixels:  16. The frame pixels, and adjacent pixels, are changed to 0.\n    *   Observation: Same as Example 1 - the adjacent cells weren't handled correctly.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Output Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Mismatched Pixels: 28\n    *   Observation: Same as Example 1 and 2.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: frame\n    description: The outermost rows and columns of the grid.\n    properties:\n      - attribute: color\n        values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n  - name: center_pixel\n    description: The pixel at the center of the grid.

This constitutes the \"frame\".\n2.  **Identify the Center Pixel:** Find the center pixel of the grid (rows // 2, cols // 2). This pixel will *not* be changed.\n3.  **Invert the Frame and Adjacent Pixels**: Iterate through each pixel of the frame. If a frame pixel has a non-zero color, change it to 0 (black).\n4.  **Set Adjacent Pixels**: For each non-zero frame pixel *before* step 3, find any adjacent pixel (up, down, left, or right\u2014not diagonal), change them to zero.\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels**: all other pixels, including the center pixel, should remain in their original state (color).\n"
