## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47503DF0>

**output:**
```
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47500F40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a value of either 0 or 1, corresponding to white and blue, respectively. The transformation appears to involve some kind of alteration of the pixel values based on their initial values and potentially their spatial relationships.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - name: value
        type: integer
        domain: [0, 1]
      - name: color
        type: categorical
        domain: [white, blue]
        mapping:
          0: white
          1: blue

actions:
  - name: invert_pixel
    type: transformation
    description: Changes pixel value from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.
    conditions:
      - if value is 0, change to 1
      - if value is 1, change to 0
    scope: conditional

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid with rows and columns.
    - type: adjacency
      description: Each pixel has up to 8 neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Invert the color of corner pixels:** If a pixel is in any of the corners of the input, then it will be swapped 0->1, and 1->0
2.  **Invert the color of the center pixel:** If a pixel is the center pixel in the input, then it will be swapped 0->1, and 1->0
3.  **Invert the remaining pixels:** The four remaining pixels are inverted, so 0->1 and 1->0.

Essentially, all pixel colors in the input are inverted to create the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
