Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a simplistic interpretation of the first example, assuming a simple color inversion and cross formation. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern. The core issue is that the code inverts *all* pixels on the central row and column, rather than selectively inverting based on the original pixel value relative to its surroundings. The code correctly identifies the non-zero color and the center, but the inversion logic is flawed. The expected output consistently shows a "cross" of inverted colors, but only where the original input had a '0' at the center and the non-zero color on the intersecting row/column.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly distinguish between the background (0) and the foreground (non-zero color) and identify the "cross" as a derived object formed by the intersection of the central row and column.

2.  **Precise Inversion Logic:** The inversion should only occur:
    *   Along the central row and central column.
    *   At the intersection of the central row and column, the color should always be the original non zero-color.
    *   Where a '0' exists in the original, it is inverted in the output to the other color.
    *   Where the other color exits on the center row/column, it should be converted to '0' in the output.

3.  **Iterative Validation:** After modifying the natural language program and subsequent code, we must re-test against *all* training examples to ensure the changes generalize correctly.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    input_colors: [0, 1]
    output_colors: [0, 1]
    input_center_value: 0
    output_center_value: 0
    match: False
    pixels_off: 9
    notes: >
      The cross is formed, but inversion is incorrect. All central row/column
      pixels are flipped, not just those needing inversion according to
      the rule.
  - example_id: 2
    input_shape: [5, 5]
    output_shape: [5, 5]
    input_colors: [0, 2]
    output_colors: [0, 2]
    input_center_value: 0
    output_center_value: 0
    match: False
    pixels_off: 17
    notes: >
      Similar to example 1, the inversion affects all central row/column
      pixels instead of selectively inverting. Center value should be 0.
  - example_id: 3
    input_shape: [7, 7]
    output_shape: [7, 7]
    input_colors: [0, 3]
    output_colors: [0, 3]
    input_center_value: 0
    output_center_value: 0
    match: False
    pixels_off: 25
    notes: >
      Again, the entire central row and column are incorrectly inverted.
      Center value should be 0.
```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    color: 0
    description: The background color of the grid.
  - name: foreground
    color: "non-zero (varies)"
    description: The primary color forming the initial shape (if any).
  - name: cross
    description: >
      A derived object formed by the intersection of the central row and
      central column.  The color at the intersection of the cross is the
      original other_color. Colors are inverted along the cross.
transformations:
  - action: invert_cross
    description: >
      Invert colors only along the central row and column. Where a 0 exists
      it is inverted to the other color. Where the other color exists on the
      central row or column, it becomes 0. The center pixel remains
      the original non-zero color.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the background and foreground colors:** The background is always color '0'. The foreground color is the other color present in the input grid.

2.  **Find the center:** Determine the central row and central column indices of the input grid.

3.  **Form the Cross:** Create a "cross" shape in the output grid. This cross is defined by the central row and central column.

4.  **Invert Colors on Cross:**
    *   The pixel at the very center of the cross remains at the original non zero color.
    *   All the other pixels on the cross are inverted:
    *   If the input pixel on the central row/column is the background color (0), change it to the foreground color in the output.
    *    If the input pixel on the central row/column is the foreground color, change it to the background color (0) in the output.

5.  **Preserve other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid that are not part of the central row or column remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
