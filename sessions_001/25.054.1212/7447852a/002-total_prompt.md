## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=640x192 at 0x7BFC4890B040>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0
4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2
4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of the same dimensions. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color replacement, but a more contextual rule based on the position and arrangement of the colors. I notice that yellow (4) appears in the output where there are red(2) pixels in horizontal or vertical adjecent positions to white (0) pixles in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object: |
     Pixels, characterized by color (integer value) and position (row, column).
  - colors:
      - 0: white
      - 2: red
      - 4: yellow
  - property: |
      Adjacency of pixels is crucial for the transformation.
  - transformation_context: |
      Yellow pixels appear in the output based on a combination of red and
      white pixels in the input.
  - spatial_relation: |
      Horizontal and vertical adjacency matter, diagonals do not appear to
      be relevant.
  - initial_hypothesis: |
      Yellow pixels are placed where red and white pixels are orthogonally adjacent.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid identical in size to the input grid.
2.  **Iteration:** For each cell in the input grid:
    *   Check if input cell is red. If not red, copy input cell value directly to the corresponding output cell.
    *   If red, check orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right).
    *   If any adjacent cell is white (0) and any adjacent cell is red (2), change the corresponding cell in the output grid to yellow (4). Diagonally adjecent cells do not count.
    *   If cell is read (2) but there is no adjacent (horizontal or vertical) white (0), or all adjecent cells are also red(2), copy input directly to output.
3. **Output:** The modified grid becomes the final output.

Essentially, the transformation replaces some red pixels with yellow pixels in the output if that red pixel has orthogonal adjacency with at least one white and one red pixel. It is not necessary for the red and white pixels to be adjecent to each other, they just have to be adjecent to the original red pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
