  - observation: |
      The output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels in addition to red and white.
  - observation: |
      The grid dimensions (height and width) are the same in the input and output.
  - observation: |
      Red pixels in the input grid often, but not always, correspond to red pixels in the same location in the output grid.
  - observation: |
    Yellow pixels are in proximity of red pixels.
  - observation: |
      In input, there is a 3x3 square using any red color as a corner. The red pixels in the input grid, that are not any of the corners in these potential 3x3 squares, become yellow.
