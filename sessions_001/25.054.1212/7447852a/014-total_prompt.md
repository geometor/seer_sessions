## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0
0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2
0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1152x192 at 0x7BFC47503DF0>

**output:**
```
2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4
4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 0 2
4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid consists primarily of white (0) and red (2) pixels. The output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels while retaining some of the red and white pixels from the input. The dimensions of the grid (height and width) remain constant during the transformation. The key seems to be the relative positioning and arrangement of the red pixels, with yellow pixels appearing in their vicinity in the output.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains only red (2) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels in addition to red and white.
  - observation: |
      The grid dimensions (height and width) are the same in the input and output.
  - observation: |
      Red pixels in the input grid often, but not always, correspond to red pixels in the same location in the output grid.
  - observation: |
    Yellow pixels are in proximity of red pixels.
  - observation: |
      In input, there is a 3x3 square using any red color as a corner. The red pixels in the input grid, that are not any of the corners in these potential 3x3 squares, become yellow.
  - relationship: |
      Input and output grids have an identical structure/schema.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all red pixels that are not corners of an available 3x3 square using red pixels for its corners.
3.  **Copy** the input grid to the output grid.
4. **Change** to yellow color those identified pixels.

In essence the program operates in a way to copy and identify specific red pixels in the grid and apply color changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
