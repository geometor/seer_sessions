Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid.

2. **Horizontal and Vertical Expansion:**
    *   For any continuous horizontal sequence of red pixels, turn all white pixels between the left-most pixel and right-most pixel in the sequence to yellow.
    *   For any continuous vertical sequence of red pixels, turn all white pixels between the up-most and down-most pixel in the sequence to yellow.

3. **Diagonal connections:**
    * For any diagonal sequence (upleft, downright) or (upright, downleft), where at least 3 continuous pixels in the sequence, turn the white pixels between upmost and downmost pixels to yellow.

4. **Result:** The output grid is the result of applying these filling rules.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
