The primary colors involved seem to be red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color replacement, but a more contextual rule based on the position and arrangement of the colors. I notice that yellow (4) appears in the output where there are red(2) pixels in horizontal or vertical adjecent positions to white (0) pixles in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If not red, copy input cell value directly to the corresponding output cell.\n    *   If red, check orthogonally adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right).\n    *   If any adjacent cell is white (0) and any adjacent cell is red (2), change the corresponding cell in the output grid to yellow (4). Diagonally adjecent cells do not count.\n    *   If cell is read (2) but there is no adjacent (horizontal or vertical) white (0), or all adjecent cells are also red(2), copy input directly to output.\n3. **Output:** The modified grid becomes the final output.\n\nEssentially, the transformation replaces some red pixels with yellow pixels in the output if that red pixel has orthogonal adjacency with at least one white and one red pixel. It is not necessary for the red and white pixels to be adjecent to each other, they just have to be adjecent to the original red pixel.\n"
