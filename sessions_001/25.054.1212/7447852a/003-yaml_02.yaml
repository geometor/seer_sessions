    observations:
      - red pixels (2) change to yellow (4)
      - changes occur when a red pixel is orthogonally adjacent to both white (0) and red (2) pixels
      - changes seem to happen in the "top-right" corner formed by red and white pixels.
      - unchanged red cells do *not* have both a red *and* white neighbor

    observations:
      - reinforces the observation of red-to-yellow changes with adjacent red and white
      - multiple instances where the corner condition applies
      - red on edge of grid and adjacent to white does not change.
