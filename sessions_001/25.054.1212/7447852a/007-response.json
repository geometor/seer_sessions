The primary colors observed are red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve some kind of interaction or influence between the red pixels and potentially the introduction of yellow pixels. The output grid retains the same dimensions as the input grid. There seems to be a concept of \"filling\" or \"expansion\" around certain red pixels, possibly influenced by adjacent pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
