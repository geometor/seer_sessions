            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simplified interpretation of the first training example, focusing on *any* adjacent red and white pixels. It correctly identifies the colors involved (red, white, and yellow) and the concept of adjacency, but it fails to capture the *directional* and *positional* relationships that determine *which* red pixels should change. The results clearly show that many red pixels that should change to yellow aren't, and, implicitly, no pixels were incorrectly transformed to yellow. The function will change a red pixel to yellow if it is adjacent to at least one white and one red. It is under-transforming. We need to consider other features and patterns to create a more specific condition than simply \"any adjacent\".\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to *where* the changes occur and *where* they don't. Look closely at the spatial relationship between reds, whites, and where yellows occur in the output.\n2.  **Identify Specific Conditions:** Instead of just \"adjacent,\" determine the precise spatial relationship. Does it involve corners? Edges? Specific directions (above, below, left, right)?\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, create a new, more precise natural language program that accurately describes the transformation.\n4.   **Ensure Prior Consistency** Be sure to consider ARC-AGI prior knowledge and how that is relevant.\n\n**Fact Gathering and YAML:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_grid: |\n      2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0\n      0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n      0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n    output_grid: |\n      2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0\n      4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2\n      4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n    observations:\n      - red pixels (2) change to yellow (4)\n      - changes occur when a red pixel is orthogonally adjacent to both white (0) and red (2) pixels\n      - changes seem to happen in the \"top-right\" corner formed by red and white pixels.\n      - unchanged red cells do *not* have both a red *and* white neighbor\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_grid: |\n      2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\n      0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0\n      0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\n    output_grid: |\n      2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\n      4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0\n      4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2\n    observations:\n      - reinforces the observation of red-to-yellow changes with adjacent red and white\n      - multiple instances where the corner condition applies\n      - red on edge of grid and adjacent to white does not change.\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_grid: |\n      2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0\n      0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n      0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n    output_grid: |\n      2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4\n      4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 0 2 4 2 0 2 0 2\n      4 4 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 4 4 4 2 0 0 0\n    observations:\n      - pattern continues consistently\n      - rightmost red pixel adjacent to the rightmost white pixel in the first row\n      - more examples reinforcing \"corner\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel of the input grid, looking for red pixels (value 2).\n2.  **Check for \"Corner\":** For each red pixel, examine its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right). A red pixel should be changed if and only if a white pixel and a red pixel are orthogonally adjacent forming an \"L\" shape, with the target red pixel at the \"corner\" joining the white and red pixels.\n3. **Change to Yellow:** If a red pixel does *not* have *both* an orthogonally adjacent red *and* white pixel, it does not change. If a red pixel *does* have at least one orthogonally adjacent red and one orthogonally adjacent white pixel, it changes to yellow (value 4).\n\nThis refined program now better explains the specifics of the relationship. It accounts for that fact that *only* some of the pixels adjacent to both red and white change, specifically the ones at the intersection of the implied lines of red and white.\n"
