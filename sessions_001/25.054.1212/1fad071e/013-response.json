The output is a 1x5 grid containing digits 0 and 1, also representing white and blue. There appears to be a significant reduction in size and a change in the distribution of colors. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple operations like mirroring, rotation, or direct color substitution based on location. It likely involves some form of counting or aggregation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Since the input is a 9x9 grid, this will result in three regions: columns 1-3, columns 4-6, and columns 7-9.\n\n2.  **Within each region**, separately sum the number of red (2) pixels *vertically* in each column.\n\n3.  **Within each region**, identify the column which had the highest count from step 2.\n\n4. If there is a tie between columns, choose the left most column, and set that column to 1 (blue) in output. All other columns are assigned 0 (white).\n\n5. Combine all the results to produce a final output 1xN, where N is the original number of columns divided by 3 and rounded up. N=3 regions in original input grid. Each region will be encoded as a single pixel.\n    a. Determine the maximum sum from the three red pixel count sums within region 1 (first three colums).\n    b. The max value is 2, in columns 1, and 2. Choose the first one (left most). The resulting pixel is blue (1).\n    c. Determine the maximum sum from the three red pixel count sums within region 2 (middle three columns).\n    d. The max value is 2, in columns 4 and 5. Choose the first one. The resulting pixel is blue (1).\n    e. Determine the maximum sum from the three red pixel count sums within region 3 (last three columns).\n    f. The max value is 2, in columns 8 and 9. Choose the first one. The resulting pixel is blue (1).\n   \n6. Count the occurence of each sum obtained in step 2 *across all regions*.\n\n7. If any of the obtained sums equal the total number of regions, it means that the sum appeared in every group. Create an output pixel and assign 1 (blue).\n    a. 2 is in every region. Add blue pixel to output.\n    b. 0 is in every region. Add blue pixel to output.\n    c. 1 is in NOT every region, skip.\n\n8. **If no sums occurred in all regions**, create an output pixel and assign 0 (white).\n\n9. Concatenate the pixels generated in step 5 and 7 and 8. Output is 1 1 1 1 0.\n\n"
