Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger, multi-colored grid (input) into a smaller, seemingly simplified grid (output). The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The output grid only contains white (0) and blue (1). The size reduction is significant, suggesting a summarizing or aggregating operation rather than a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping. The colors in output appears to represent existence of a color in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2]  # white, blue, red
      - shape: 9x9
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1] # white, blue
      - shape: 1x5
  - name: color_blue
    value: 1
  - name: color_white
    value: 0

actions:
  - name: summarize_columns
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Counts the presence/absence of blue color in pre-defined regions of input

relationships:
   - input_grid contains output_grid information in summarized format
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Divide** the input grid into five contiguous, non-overlapping vertical regions.
2. **Iterate** through each of the five regions, from left to right.
3. For each region, check for the presence of the color blue (1).
4. **Output**: Create new output row. For each region, if blue is present, output a blue (1) pixel, otherwise output a white (0) pixel. The final output should be a single row with 5 pixels. For example: region 1 of input has blue, output is 1, next region has blue, output is 1, next region has no blue, output is 0, etc.
