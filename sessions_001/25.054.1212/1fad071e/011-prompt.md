Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output grid is always 1x5. The number of blue pixels in the output is determined by the number of blue pixels in the input:

1. Calculate the number of blue pixels in the input grid.
2. If the number of blue pixels is less than or equal to 3, output is = input // 2
3. If the number of blue pixels is greater than 3, output grid has 4 blue pixels.
4. Fill the remaining cells in the 1x5 output grid with white pixels (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a 1x5 array filled with zeros (white)
    output_grid = np.zeros((1, 5), dtype=int)

    # Count blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid
    blue_count = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 1)

    # Determine the number of blue pixels in the output
    if blue_count <= 3:
        output_blue_count = blue_count // 2
    else:
        output_blue_count = 4

    # Fill the output grid with the determined number of blue pixels
    output_grid[0, :output_blue_count] = 1

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
