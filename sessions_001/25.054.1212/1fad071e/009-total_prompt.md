Previous Code:
```python
"""
Counts the occurrences of blue (1) pixels in the input grid and constructs a 1x5 output grid. The output grid consists of four blue pixels followed by one white pixel.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a 1x5 array filled with zeros (white)
    output_grid = np.zeros((1, 5), dtype=int)

    # Count blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid (not used, based on instructions)
    # blue_count = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 1)

    # Fill the first four cells of the output grid with blue (1)
    output_grid[0, :4] = 1

    # The last cell remains 0 (white) by initialization

    return output_grid
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
