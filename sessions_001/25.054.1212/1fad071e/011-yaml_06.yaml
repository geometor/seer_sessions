facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 1x5.
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains only blue and white pixels.
  - observation: |
      The number of blue pixels in the output is related to the number of blue pixels in the input.
  - rule: |
      If the input blue pixel count is greater than 3, the output has 4 blue pixels.
  - rule: |
      If the input has less or equal to 3, then the number of blue pixels is not input//2, must re-evaluate.
  - corrected_rule:
      If the number of blue pixels equals 4,5,6 or 7 then output blue count = input blue count - 3
