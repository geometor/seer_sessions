The output is a 1x5 grid, also with integers (0 and 1). The output seems to drastically reduce the information content of the input. The presence of multiple colors in the input, and only two in the output (white and blue), indicates some form of filtering or counting is likely involved.  The significant size reduction and specific output colors, along with the layout, suggest a counting of colored areas in the input followed by a selection.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
