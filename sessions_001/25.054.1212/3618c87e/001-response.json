The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).  The input and output grids are mostly identical except for the bottom row and, specifically, a central element that swaps colors between gray and blue.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
