## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 0 8
0 8 0
8 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47578730>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7BFC4757BA90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: azure (8) and white (0). The output is a single number, 2, on what would be a red (2) background. The number in the output seems to correspond somehow to the input grid, but not in a simple way related to counting every cell, or even every azure, white, or background cell (which do not appear in output). I suspect counting is involved, possibly involving specific arrangements of cells.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements:
        - color: azure (8)
          positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), (1,1)]
        - color: white (0)
          positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]
  - output:
      type: single_value
      data_type: integer
      value: 2
      background_color: red

  - relationships:
      - type: count
        description: "The output value (2) likely represents a count derived from the input grid."
      - type: positional
        description: "The specific positions and arrangement of colors in the input grid are crucial for determining the output."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid consists of individual cells, which can be treated as objects. Each cell has a color property (azure or white).
2.  **Count Specific Pattern:** The objective seems to be count the azure squares (8), and somehow that corresponds to the final output of red (2) on a solid background.
3. Count the number of instances of "azure" colored pixels which form a 2x2 box filled with only azure.
4. If no 2x2 boxes are filled with azure, then output will be 0.
5.  **Output:** Present the final count as a single integer, shown with a red background.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
