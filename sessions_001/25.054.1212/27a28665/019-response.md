Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of numbers, where each number represents a color (0 for white, 1 for blue). The output is a single number (3) represented as a green square. It appears the task involves counting something within the input grid. The output's color (green) corresponds to the number 3 in the `COLOR_MAP` provided in the system prompt.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input is a 2D grid (3x3) of integers."
  - object: "Pixels with values 0 or 1"
  - properties:
      color: "0 is white, 1 is blue."
  - observation: "Output is a single integer."
  - object: "Output integer presented in the center of the 3x3 green image."
  - action: "Counting"
  - relationship: "Output integer is related to the count of something in the input grid."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of blue pixels (pixels with a value of 1) in the input grid.
2.  The final output is this count.
