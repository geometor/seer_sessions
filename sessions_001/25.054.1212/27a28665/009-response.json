            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a revised natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were incorrect. The code focused on finding 2x2 squares of azure (color 8), but the examples demonstrate that the rule involves counting *all* distinct, *non-overlapping* 2x2 squares, regardless of their color. It appears that each of the 1x1 cells in the output represents the number of 2x2 blocks. Also, the output grid is not a representation of the input grid's size or shape; it's always a 1x1 grid containing the single integer count.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is:\n\n1.  **Correct the Target:** Modify the code to count 2x2 squares of *any* color, not just azure.\n2.  **Ensure Non-Overlapping Counts:** While the current `find_2x2_squares` function finds starts of all the 2x2 squares, the natural language program specifies that the count should non-overlapping squares, therefore the implementation would need to consider this. The current examples do not show good cases of overlapping squares.\n3.  **Output Format:** Ensure the output is always a 1x1 grid with the count.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Expected Output: 1, Transformed Output: 0\n    *   There is one 2x2 block of grey color (5)\n    *   The predicted output should be 1\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Expected Output: 2, Transformed Output: 0\n    *   There are zero 2x2 blocks\n    *   The predicted output should be 0.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Expected Output: 2, Transformed Output: 0\n    *    There are zero 2x2 blocks\n    *   The predicted output should be 0\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Expected Output: 3, Transformed Output: 0\n    *   There is one 2x2 block of blue color (1)\n    *   The predicted output should be 1.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Expected Output: 3, Transformed Output: 1\n    *    There is one 2x2 block of azure color (8).\n    *   The predicted output should be 1\n\n*   **Example 6:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Expected Output: 1, Transformed Output: 0\n    *   There is one 2x2 block of yellow color (4).\n    *   The predicted output is 1.\n\n*   **Example 7:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Expected Output: 6, Transformed Output: 0\n    *    There is one 2x2 block of gray color (5)\n    *   The predicted output should be 1.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: Count non-overlapping 2x2 squares in the input grid.\n  - input:\n      type: 2D grid\n      dimensions: Variable (between 1x1 and 30x30)\n      elements: Integers (0-9, representing colors)\n  - output:\n      type: 2D grid\n      dimensions: 1x1\n      elements: Integer (count of 2x2 squares)\n  - objects:\n      - name: 2x2 square\n        description: A contiguous block of 2x2 pixels of the same color.\n  - actions:\n      - name: count_squares\n        description: Count the number of non-overlapping 2x2 squares in the input grid.\n  - constraints:\n      output_grid_size: \"The output is always a 1x1 grid.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Input:** Receive a 2D grid of integers (colors).\n2.  **Process:** Iterate through the grid to identify all non-overlapping 2x2 squares. A 2x2 square is defined as four adjacent cells with the same color value.\n3. **Count:** count the number of 2x2 squares found.\n4.  **Output:** Create a 1x1 grid. The single cell contains the total count of 2x2 squares found in the previous step.\n"
