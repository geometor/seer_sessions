## Example 3

**input:**
```
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 5 5 1 1 1
1 5 5 1 1 1
1 6 6 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x448 at 0x7BFC475A0C10>

**output:**
```
5 5
5 5
6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x192 at 0x7BFC475A0280>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller grid. The input grid appears to have a large area of a single color (blue, represented by '1') and a smaller, internal region of different colors (gray '5' and magenta '6'). The output grid consists only of the colors from this internal region, excluding the surrounding blue pixels. The output grid retains the spatial arrangement of the internal colors.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x6 (rows x columns)
      - values: [0-9] # Representing colors
      - dominant_color: 1 (blue)
  - name: internal_region
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - colors: [5 (gray), 6 (magenta)]
      - location: embedded within input_grid
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x2
      - values: derived from internal_region
      - colors: [5, 6]

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Isolates the internal_region from the input_grid.
    parameters:
      - criteria: color difference from dominant_color

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: internal_region
  - type: corresponds_to
    from: internal_region
    to: output_grid
    transformation: extraction

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Dominant Border Color:** Determine the most frequent color in the outer rows and columns of the input grid. In this example its blue (1).

2.  **Locate the Internal Region:** Find the contiguous block of pixels within the input grid that *does not* include the dominant border color.

3.  **Extract the Internal Region:** Create a new grid consisting only of the pixels from the identified internal region, preserving their original relative positions.

4.  **Output the new grid:** present the extracted subgrid

In essence, the transformation rule is to "crop" the input grid by removing the outer "frame" of the dominant color, and outputting the remaining internal region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
