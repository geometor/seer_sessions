The input grid contains numerical values representing different colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, white=0). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on specific colors and their spatial relationships within the input. The output grid includes zeros, suggesting some elements are filtered out.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
