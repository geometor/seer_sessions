Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains numerical values representing different colors (blue=1, red=2, green=3, white=0). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on specific colors and their spatial relationships within the input. The output grid includes zeros, suggesting some elements are filtered out.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 5x7
      - values: [0, 1, 2, 3]  # Representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: [0, 1, 2, 3] # Representing colors

actions:
  - type: filter
    description: Select specific elements from the input grid.
  - type: condense
    description: Reduce the dimensions of the grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: Many-to-one mapping, filtering, and condensing.
  - color_values: input contains colors 1,2,3, output contains color 2,3,0
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Blue Elements:** Focus on the non-blue (non-1) colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** From the top-left corner of the first identified non-blue pixel (reading row first) extract non-blue pixels to a 3 x 3 output grid.
3.  **Handle edges:** If there are not enough pixels to fill a row or column use 0s.

In summary, the input grid has non-blue values consolidated to the top-left, and empty values are filled with white(0).
