            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program, which focused on removing a \"frame\" of the dominant border color, was partially correct. It worked perfectly for Example 3 but failed on Examples 1 and 2. The primary issue is that the program assumes *all* instances of the dominant border color should be removed, which is not the case. It seems the frame removal stops when it encounters a different color *or* when it removes all contiguous instances of the dominant color in a straight line from that edge. The original logic does not consider that zero (white) might be a valid part of the frame if other colors are not dominant on edges. Instead, the program needs to \"look\" from each side and eliminate the color that it finds.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a more detailed look at each example, incorporating observations about the expected behavior:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 7)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Dominant Border Color: Blue (1)\n    *   Problem: The code removed the '1's correctly. All values of 0, should\n        have been replaced by the next value of the outer frame.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (2, 3)\n    *   Dominant Border Color: Blue (1)\n    *   Problem: Same issue as example 1, the color 1 (blue) was remove.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 6)\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 2)\n    *   Dominant Border Color: Blue (1)\n    *   Success: The code correctly identified and removed the border.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: \"016\"\n  - objects:\n      - name: input_grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - colors: [blue, white, red, green, grey, magenta]\n          - shape: variable\n      - name: output_grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - colors: [blue, white, red, green, grey, magenta]\n          - shape: variable, generally smaller than input_grid\n  - actions:\n      - name: crop_border\n        description: Remove contiguous regions of color, starting from each edge, stopping if different color is found, or if contiguos line is removed.\n        input: input_grid\n        output: output_grid\n  - observations:\n      - example_1:\n          - input_shape: (5,7)\n          - output_shape: (3,3)\n          - border_colors_removed: [blue]\n          - note: \"Outer frame is removed.\"\n      - example_2:\n          - input_shape: (7,7)\n          - output_shape: (2,3)\n          - border_colors_removed: [blue]\n          - note: \"Outer frame is removed.\"\n      - example_3:\n          - input_shape: (7, 6)\n          - output_shape: (3, 2)\n          - border_colors_removed: [blue]\n          - note: \"Outer frame is removed.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Border Colors:** For each of the four edges (top, bottom, left, right) of the input grid, identify the color of the first pixel.\n2.  **Iterative Removal:**\n    *   **Top:** Starting from the top row and moving downwards, remove entire rows of the top border color until a row containing a different color is encountered.\n    *   **Bottom:** Starting from the bottom row and moving upwards, remove entire rows of the bottom border color until a row containing a different color is encountered.\n    *   **Left:** Starting from the leftmost column and moving rightwards, remove entire columns of the left border color until a column containing a different color is encountered.\n    *   **Right:** Starting from the rightmost column and moving leftwards, remove entire columns of the right border color until a column containing a different color is encountered.\n3.  **Output:** The remaining subgrid after the border removal is the output grid.\n\nKey changes from original:\n\n- Split into 4 actions - one for each direction.\n- Remove entire row/column based on color.\n- Stop when color is different, not just first occurrence.\n"
