There are two distinct regions: a 2x1 region of '3' (green) and a 2x1 region of '2' (red). The output is a 2x3 grid. The output grid contains only the values present in the distinct regions of the input grid ('3' and '2'), as well as '0' (white), which isn't explicitly present as a contiguous object in the input. The arrangement of the values in the output seems to correspond to the vertical order in which they appear in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this example, those are '3' (green) and '2' (red).\n3. **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 2x3 output grid.\n4. **Populate Output:**  Fill the output grid as follows:\n   - First column:  The color of the distinct region encountered *first* when scanning from top-to-bottom and left-to-right (green '3'). Repeat this value for both rows.\n   - Second column: Insert the color '0' (white) in both rows.\n   - Third column: The color of the distinct region encountered *second* (red '2'). Repeat this value for both rows.\n\nIn essence, the program extracts the unique color values of distinct, non-background regions from the input grid and arranges them in a specific 2x3 grid structure, inserting a '0' (white) column between them. The vertical order in the input defines the horizontal order from left to right in the output.\n"
