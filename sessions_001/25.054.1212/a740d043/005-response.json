            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of finding the top-left non-blue pixel and expanding until blue rows/columns are encountered works for some cases (Example 3), but fails when there are \"gaps\" of blue pixels *within* the object to be extracted (Examples 1 and 2). The original program interprets those internal blue pixels as boundaries, which is incorrect. The core issue seems to be that the program assumes the region to be extracted is a *contiguous* block bordered by blue, without any internal blue pixels. The expected output show this is not always true. We also see that any pixel not blue in the original sub-grid is a zero in the expected output.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Boundary Definition:** Instead of stopping expansion at *any* blue pixel, we need to redefine the boundaries. The boundaries should be solid blue rows or columns *completely enclosing* a region.\n2.  Change zeros where any value is not blue.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\nI will provide facts and a natural language program derived from these metrics.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input_grid_shape: [5, 7]\n  output_grid_shape: [3, 3]\n  top_left_non_blue: [1, 1]\n  objects:\n    - id: 1\n      type: contiguous_region\n      color_present: [2,3]\n      bounding_box: [[1,1], [3,3]] #row, col\n      internal_colors:\n        - color: blue\n          positions: [[1,3], [2,3], [3,1], [3,2]]\n  actions:\n    - name: extract_subgrid\n      parameters:\n        start: [1, 1]\n        end: [3,3]\nexample_2:\n  input_grid_shape: [7, 7]\n  output_grid_shape: [2, 3]\n  top_left_non_blue: [1, 2]\n  objects:\n    - id: 1\n      type: contiguous_region\n      color_present: [3, 2]\n      bounding_box: [[1,2], [2,4]]\n      internal_colors:\n          - color: blue\n            positions: [[1,3]]\n  actions:\n    - name: extract_subgrid\n      parameters:\n        start: [1, 2]\n        end: [2,4]\n\nexample_3:\n  input_grid_shape: [7, 6]\n  output_grid_shape: [3, 2]\n  top_left_non_blue: [2, 1]\n  objects:\n    - id: 1\n      type: contiguous_region\n      color_present: [5, 6]\n      bounding_box:  [[2,1], [4,2]]\n      internal_colors: []\n\n  actions:\n    - name: extract_subgrid\n      parameters:\n        start: [2, 1]\n        end: [4,2]\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Locate Starting Point:** Find the top-left most non-blue pixel in the input grid. This is the initial starting point (row, col).\n\n2.  **Determine Bounding Box:**\n    *   From the starting point, expand downwards until you encounter a fully blue row. The row *before* the fully blue row is the bottom boundary.\n    *   From the starting point, expand to the right until you encounter a fully blue column. The column *before* the fully blue column is the right boundary.\n    *   The top boundary is the row of the starting point.\n    *  The left boundary is the column of the starting point.\n\n3.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Create an output grid with the dimensions defined by the bounding box.\n\n4. **Fill Output:**\n    *  Iterate through the bounding box area in the original grid.\n    *  If a cell is not blue, replace it with a zero.\n    *  Copy the cells of the original grid into the output.\n"
