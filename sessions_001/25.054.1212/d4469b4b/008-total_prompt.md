## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 1 1
0 1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47F93430>

**output:**
```
0 5 0
5 5 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48A63190>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (5x5) of pixels, each with a color value (0 or 1), into a smaller grid (3x3) of pixels with different color values (0 or 5). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern with some solid regions of color 1. The output grid seems to simplify the input, consolidating regions into single pixels, and changing the color coding.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 5x5 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0 (white) and 1 (blue).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - object: Input_Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5
      colors: [0, 1]
  - object: Output_Grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 5]
  - relationship: Output_Grid is a compressed representation of Input_Grid.
  - action: Color transformation.
           details: Color 1 in the input is mapped to color 5 in the output
  - action: Grid compression or downsampling
            details: the 5x5 is reduced to a 3x3
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input Inspection:** Receive a 5x5 grid as input. Observe the distribution of 0 (white) and 1 (blue) pixels.

2.  **Grid Reduction:** Reduce the 5x5 grid to a 3x3 grid. I can achieve this by focusing on a 3x3 subgrid centered within the 5x5.

3. **Color Mapping within the 3x3 centered subgrid**
    - Examine a centered 3x3 sub-section of the 5x5 input
    - if the sub-section cell is a 1 (blue), map it to 5(gray).
    - If the sub-section cell is a 0 (white), it remains a 0 (white)

4.  **Output:** Present the resulting 3x3 grid.

In essence, the transformation identifies 3x3 area of interest within the original 5x5. It then performs a color swap. The output is the simplified, color-transformed 3x3 section.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
