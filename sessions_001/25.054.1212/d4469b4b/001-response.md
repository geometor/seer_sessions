Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains pixels of two colors: red (2) and white (0). The output grid seems to represent a compressed or summarized version of the input grid, and uses two colors: gray (5) and white (0). The spatial arrangement of colors in the output seems related to the arrangement of red pixels in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: input_grid
    description: Initial grid of pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: [red, white]
      - dimensions: 5x5
  - type: output_grid
    description: Transformed grid of pixels.
    properties:
      - colors: [gray, white]
      - dimensions: 3x3
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous blocks of red pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: red
      - shape: irregular
  - type: transformation
    description: Mapping of input grid to output grid.
    properties:
      - spatial_relationship:  Input grid regions map to output grid pixels.
      - color_mapping: red regions in input correspond to gray in output; white regions in input correspond to white in output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid (5x5) into nine regions. Conceptually superimpose a 3x3 grid over the 5x5 input. Each cell in the conceptual 3x3 grid represents a region.

2.  **Check Regions**: Examine each of the nine regions for any red (2) pixels.

3.  **Map to Output**:
    *   If a region in the input contains one or more red pixels, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (5).
    *   If a region in the input contains only white pixels (0), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0).

4.  **Output Grid:** the final output is the resulting 3x3 grid.
