The input grid contains only two colors: white (0) and red (2). The output grid contains white (0) and gray (5). The output seems to somehow summarize or abstract the input. The red pixels in the input appear to be replaced by gray in the output. The relationship doesn't look like a simple 1-to-1 pixel mapping because the sizes are different. It's more like a block-based transformation. The size reduction suggests some form of compression or summarization.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider a sliding 3x3 window that creates nine overlapping 3 x 3 regions. These overlap starting with top-left as the first, with movements going right and down.\n\n2. **Check Region and Reduce:** The first region is top-left corner.\n    - If the region contains any red pixels (value 2), the central pixel of the output grid corresponding to this region should be gray (5).\n    - If a 3x3 region contains no red, the corresponding output will be white(0).\n    - The 3x3 output is effectively made of nine center values.\n\n3.  **Output:** The output is a 3x3 grid, which is formed by taking the results above.\n"
