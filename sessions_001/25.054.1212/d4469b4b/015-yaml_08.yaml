facts:
  - observation: |
      All output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain only white (0) and gray (5) pixels.
  - observation: |
      Input grids are 5x5.
  - observation: |
      The presence of gray pixels in the output grid is related to the presence of other color pixels in the input grid.
  - observation: |
     There are no green pixels in examples 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and the output is always a grey cross.
  - observation: |
      Examples 3 and 7 both contain green, and the output contains a grey area on the bottom.
  - hypothesis: |
      The input grid is subdivided into 3x3 overlapping regions.
  - hypothesis: |
      The presence of a specific color, such as green, within an input region triggers a corresponding gray area in the output.
  - hypothesis:
      When color green is not present, a gray cross is generated.
