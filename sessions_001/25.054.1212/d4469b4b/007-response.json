The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern with some solid regions of color 1. The output grid seems to simplify the input, consolidating regions into single pixels, and changing the color coding.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Observe the distribution of 0 (white) and 1 (blue) pixels.\n\n2.  **Grid Reduction:** Reduce the 5x5 grid to a 3x3 grid. I can achieve this by focusing on a 3x3 subgrid centered within the 5x5.\n\n3. **Color Mapping within the 3x3 centered subgrid**\n    - Examine a centered 3x3 sub-section of the 5x5 input\n    - if the sub-section cell is a 1 (blue), map it to 5(gray).\n    - If the sub-section cell is a 0 (white), it remains a 0 (white)\n\n4.  **Output:** Present the resulting 3x3 grid.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies 3x3 area of interest within the original 5x5. It then performs a color swap. The output is the simplified, color-transformed 3x3 section.\n"
