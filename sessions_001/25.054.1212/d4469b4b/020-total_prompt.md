## Example 4

**input:**
```
1 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1 1
1 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC443918D0>

**output:**
```
0 5 0
5 5 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC44392F20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains only 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 0s (white) and 5s (gray). There's a clear reduction in size, and it appears the output grid is somehow summarizing or extracting information from the input grid. The positions of the 5s in the output seem to correspond to areas with higher concentrations of 1s in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: [0, 1]
    colors: [white, blue]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 5]
    colors: [white, gray]

actions:
  - name: summarize
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Condenses the input grid into a smaller representation.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_mapping
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description:  The output grid's cells seem to represent a summarized view of corresponding 3x3 regions within the input grid, based on the number of 1s.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Divide:** Conceptually divide the 5x5 input grid into nine overlapping 3x3 regions.  Each cell in the 3x3 output grid corresponds to one of these 3x3 regions in the input.

2. **Analyze and Convert to output:** Starting from the top-left, inspect a 3x3 area of input.
  - If input 3x3 area has one or more blue pixel, output a gray pixel.
  - If the 3x3 area does not contain at least one blue, output a white.

3.  **Output:** Create the 3x3 output grid based on the conversion in step 2.

Essentially, the output grid is showing a condensed version of the input, where each output pixel is grey if the corresponding area in the input contains one or more blue pixels, and white otherwise.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
