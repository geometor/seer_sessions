Superimpose a 3x3 grid over the 5x5 input grid, creating nine overlapping 3x3 regions.
For each of the nine 3x3 regions:
  - If all pixels within the 3x3 region are white (0), the corresponding output pixel in the 3x3 output grid is white (0).
  - If *any* pixel within the 3x3 region is *not* white (not 0), examine the *row* and *column* of the 3x3 region to determine if the corresponding output cell should be changed to gray (5):
    - If the 3x3 region is in the first or third row of regions (0,2), and in the *middle* column(1), then if there are *any* non-white pixels, the corresponding output cell in that location is 5.
    - If the 3x3 region is in the *middle* row of regions (1), then if there are *any* non-white pixels, the corresponding output cell in that location is 5.
The result is a 3x3 grid.
