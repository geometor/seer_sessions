## Example 7

**input:**
```
0 3 0 3 0
3 3 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
3 3 3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4423F820>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 0 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4423C5E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid contains white (0) and gray (5). The output appears to be a condensed and recolored representation of a pattern within the input. It seems like contiguous blocks of green (3) in input becomes gray (5) in the output and the output's dimension are related to how many green (3) contiguous blocks there.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 5x5
      colors: [0, 3]  # white, green
      objects:
        - color: 3 # green
          type: contiguous_blocks
          positions: [[0,1], [0,3], [1,0], [1,1], [2,1], [3,2], [4,0], [4,1], [4,2]]
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 5] # white, gray
      objects:
       - color: 5
         type: condensed_blocks
         positions: [[0,2],[1,2],[2,0],[2,1],[2,2]]

  - transformation:
      type: condensation_and_recoloring
      mapping:
        3: 5 # green becomes grey
        0: 0 # White stays white

  - spatial_relationship:
      description: output blocks correspond to the arrangement of the contiguous green blocks in the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Contiguous Blocks:** Locate all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine output dimension by counting the number of rows and columns occupied by the object made by the green pixels:**. There are three such rows and 3 such columns in input, therefore create an output of 3x3.
3.  **Recolor:** Iterate through the green object, whereever there are 3s change them to 5 in the output. Where there are 0s, keep them 0 in the output.

In essence, the program identifies the contiguous blocks of green in the input, creates a smaller grid representing the "shape" of the object formed by those contiguous green, and recolors the green blocks to gray, maintaining white pixels as white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
