The input grid contains only two colors: red (2) and white (0). The output grid also contains only two colors: grey (5) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in size and a change in color of some pixels. There is some sort of summarization/compression to reduce the grid size. The relative positions of the 0's are very similar.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If Input region contains at least one red (2) pixel, set Output to grey (5).\n   - Output (0,1) represents Input region within x=0-2, y=1-3\n   - Output (0,2) represents Input region within x=0-2, y=2-4\n   - Output (1,0) represents Input region within x=1-3, y=0-2\n   - Output (1,1) represents Input region within x=1-3, y=1-3\n   - Output (1,2) represents Input region within x=1-3, y=2-4\n   - Output (2,0) represents Input region within x=2-4, y=0-2\n   - Output (2,1) represents Input region within x=2-4, y=1-3\n   - Output (2,2) represents Input region within x=2-4, y=2-4\n   - Specifically the central 3x3 area of the input becomes the output.\n\n4. **Color Transformation**: if the input pixels within that region contains any 2 (red pixels) then the output cell is a 5, otherwise it is a 0.\n\nIn essence any red (2) in 3x3 regions in the center of input will be gray(5) in the output.\n"
