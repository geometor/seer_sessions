## Example 3

**input:**
```
3 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 3
0 3 3 0 0
0 3 0 3 0
3 0 3 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC44392F20>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 0 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC475854E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (5x5) of colored pixels into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains green (3) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in size and a change in color for some of the pixels. It appears there is a relationship between the positions and colors of the input to how the output is constructed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements:
      - color: green (3)
      - color: white (0)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: gray (5)
      - color: white (0)

actions:
  - name: size_reduction
    description: The grid dimensions are reduced from 5x5 to 3x3.
  - name: color_change
    description: Some green pixels in the input become gray in the output. White seems to persist.

relationships:
   - input_output: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
   - spatial: The location of colors seems important to the transformation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid, focusing on a 3x3 area.
2. **Condense**: Create a 3 x 3 output.
3. **Color Mapping**:
    *   If in the top right corner, the 3x3 area of the 5x5 contains at least one green pixel, the corresponding pixel in the output grid is gray (5).
    *   if there is at least one green pixel in the bottom left, the output will have a gray pixel.
    *  All other pixels in the output grid default to white.

In short, the green in the top right, and bottom left influence the 3x3 output to have gray, and everywhere else is white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
