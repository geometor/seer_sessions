The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The colors are represented by single digits (1-7). It appears that the transformation involves a mirroring or reflection of some kind, but it's not a simple horizontal or vertical flip. The positions of some colors change, while others remain in the same location. There might be a specific axis or point of reflection that isn't immediately obvious. It's not a rotation. It seems certain cells swap their values.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

These pairs are not based on simple horizontal or vertical reflection.\n\n2.  **Describe the Swap Rule:** The input grid is transformed to the output grid by swapping cells across the main diagonal but in reverse.\n    In more detail:\n    - The cell at `input[row][col]` swaps with `output[5-col][5-row]`\n    - iterate through all rows from 0 to 5.\n    - inside of each row, iterate through all cols from 0 to 5\n    - swap each `input[row][col]` with `input[5-col][5-row]`\n\n3.  **Apply the Swap:** For each identified pair, swap the color values between the corresponding pixels in the input grid to produce the output grid. Any pixel not part of a swapping pair retains its original color.\n"
