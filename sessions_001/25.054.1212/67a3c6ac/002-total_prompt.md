## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 6 6 2
6 1 6 2
7 2 7 2
1 7 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC48A61C00>

**output:**
```
2 6 6 6
2 6 1 6
2 7 2 7
2 2 7 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC48A601C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation from input to output appears to involve a manipulation of the grid's spatial arrangement, specifically a rotation or reflection, while maintaining the color of each pixel. The dimensions of the grid (4x4) remain constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        mapping:
          0: white
          1: blue
          2: red
          3: green
          4: yellow
          5: gray
          6: magenta
          7: orange
          8: azure
          9: maroon
  - observation: input_grid
    details: "Pixels are arranged in a specific configuration."
  - observation: output_grid
    details: "Pixels are rearranged, maintaining color but altering position."
  - transformation:
    type: spatial
    details: "Positions of pixels are changed systematically."
  - invariant: colors
    details: "The color of each pixel is conserved from input to output"
  - invariant: dimensions
      details: The height and width of the grid are unchanged

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the entire grid followed by swapping the position of the element at coordinate (0,0) and the element at coordinate (0,3).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
