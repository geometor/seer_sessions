The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The output grid appears to be a condensed or summarized version of the input grid, retaining only a subset of the original pixels. The spatial arrangement of pixels seems to be crucial. It looks like the upper-left corner is particularly significant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In other words the output is simply the upper-left quadrant of the input.\n\nEssentially, the rule is to take the top-left 2x2 section of the input grid and present it as the output grid.
