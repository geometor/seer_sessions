## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 3 6 4 0 6
6 0 0 3 3 4
6 4 4 3 3 0
0 3 6 0 4 6
0 6 3 0 4 3
3 4 4 6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC47587550>

**output:**
```
4 3
6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC475847C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid of colored pixels (input) into a smaller grid of colored pixels (output). The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The output grid appears to be a condensed or summarized version of the input grid, retaining only a subset of the original pixels. The spatial arrangement of pixels seems to be crucial. It looks like the upper-left corner is particularly significant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - cell_values: [0-9]  # Representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - cell_values: [0-9]

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: Selects a subgrid from the input_grid.
    parameters:
      - start_row: 0
      - start_col: 0
      - end_row: 1
      - end_col: 1

relationships:
  - type: contains
    description: input_grid contains output_grid (as a subgrid).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus on the top-left corner:** The transformation focuses on the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input grid.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the 2x2 subgrid starting at row 0, column 0 of the input grid.
3.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the extracted 2x2 subgrid. In other words the output is simply the upper-left quadrant of the input.

Essentially, the rule is to take the top-left 2x2 section of the input grid and present it as the output grid. There's no alteration of the values within that section; it's a direct copy.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
