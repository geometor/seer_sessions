## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7BFC48A61AE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing the digits '0' and '2', representing white and red pixels, respectively. The output is a 1x1 grid containing the digit '1', representing a blue pixel. The transformation seems to involve counting or summarizing the input grid in some way, then representing that summary with a single blue pixel. The most obvious relationship is counting the number of a certain type of object.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: [0, 2]
    description: Input grid with white and red pixels.
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [1, 1]
    elements: [1]
    description: Output grid with a single blue pixel.
  - type: pixel
    value: 0
    color: white
  - type: pixel
    value: 2
    color: red
  - type: pixel
    value: 1
    color: blue

actions:
  - type: count
    target: pixels
    property: color
    value: red

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid based on the count of red pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.
2.  **Output:** Create a 1x1 output grid. The output grid will be a single blue pixel of value '1'.
3.  **Represent:** Place the number from step 1 into the output grid.

In simpler terms: The program counts the red pixels in the input and places a blue pixel of value 1.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
