## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47578490>

**output:**
```
1 1 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
1 1 1
1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7BFC47579D20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids (matrices) containing numerical values representing colors.
*   The input grid is a 3x3 matrix, and the output grid is a 6x3 matrix.
*   The values in the grids are 0 and 1, corresponding to white and blue, respectively.
*   The output grid appears to be a vertically mirrored and concatenated version of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 6x3
    values: [0, 1]
    value_meaning:
      0: white
      1: blue

actions:
  - type: mirror
    axis: vertical
  - type: concatenate

relationships:
  - output: input_mirrored_vertically + input # concatenation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Mirror:** Take the input grid and create a vertically mirrored copy of it.
2.  **Concatenate:** Vertically concatenate the mirrored copy below the original input grid to produce the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
