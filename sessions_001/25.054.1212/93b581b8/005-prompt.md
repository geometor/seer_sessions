Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Central Block:** Find the 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the input grid. This block is guaranteed to be present.

2.  **Top Extension**:
    *   Copy the *top row* of the 2x2 central block to the *top two rows* of the output grid.  This copied row forms the first two rows of the entire output.

3.  **Bottom Extension**:
    *   Copy the *bottom row* of the 2x2 central block to the *bottom two rows* of the output grid. This copied row forms the last two rows of the output.

4.  **Preserve Center:** The original 2x2 central block from the input remains unchanged at the same location in the output grid.

5. **Leave Blank:** All other spaces that are not the top two rows, bottom two rows, or central 2x2 block are zero filled.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
