            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the corresponding code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and code were a good first attempt, focusing on the concept of a central 2x2 block and mirroring its elements. However, the validation against the training examples reveals a key misunderstanding: the mirroring logic is inverted. Instead of placing mirrored blocks *based on the position within the inner 2x2*, the code mirrors them *to the corners matching their position within the 2x2*, producing wrong result. Example 2 also reveals that the positioning for the central block is not correctly handled when it is not centered.\n\nThe strategy for improvement will involve:\n\n1.  **Correcting the Mirroring Logic:** The core issue is the inverted mirroring. The updated logic should map the *color* of each pixel in the central block to a 2x2 block in a corner *determined by the color, not it's position in the center*.\n2.  **Refining Central Block Handling:** Ensure that the central block is not just any 2x2 block but the central one, and handle cases, where it is not in the very center of the entire input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including calculated metrics:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 6x6\n    *   Output Shape: 6x6\n    *   Central Block Detected At: (2, 2)\n    *   Pixels Off: 16\n    *   Notes: Mirroring is inverted. Corner blocks' colors do not correspond to central colors.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 6x6\n    *   Output Shape: 6x6\n    *   Central Block Detected At: (1, 1)\n    *    Pixels Off: 20\n    *   Notes: Mirroring inverted. Central block not centered in input.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 6x6\n    *   Output Shape: 6x6\n    *   Central Block Detected At: (2, 2)\n    *   Pixels Off: 16\n    *   Notes: Mirroring is inverted. Corner blocks' colors do not correspond to central colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Base:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 016_mirror_central_block\nobjects:\n  - type: grid\n    properties:\n      dimensions: variable  # Rows and columns can vary.\n      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors\n      central_block:\n        type: subgrid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: 2x2\n          elements: non-zero integers\n          location: varies, but contains a 2x2 block of non-zero integers.\n      corner_blocks:\n        type: subgrid\n        properties:\n            dimensions: 2x2\n            elements: integers, correspond with element in Central Block.\n            location: Each corner of the overall grid.\nactions:\n  - name: find_central_block\n    input: grid\n    output: coordinates (row, column) of the top-left corner of central block\n  - name: mirror_color\n    input: color_value, grid_dimensions\n    output: corner_coordinates (row, col) where a block of 'color' is mirrored.\n  - name: create_mirrored_block\n    input: color, corner_coordinates, grid\n    output: updated grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Central Block:** Locate the *inner* 2x2 block of non-zero pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **Preserve the central block:** The central 2x2 goes to the same place in output and input.\n3.  **Color-Based Mirroring:** For each *color* present in the central 2x2 block:\n    *   Create a new 2x2 block in the output grid with that same color.\n    *   The position of this 2x2 block in the input determines which *corner* of the output grid receives a copy, the color in the central 2x2 block corresponds to the output corner by this rule, using top left corner of 2x2 block as the position.\n        *    top left color - goes to top left of output\n        *    top right color - goes to top right of output\n        *    bottom left color - goes to the bottom left\n        *    bottom right color goes to the bottom right\n4.  **Fill Remaining:** Any remaining pixels in the output grid not part of the central 2x2 block or the mirrored blocks are set to 0 (black).\n\nThe crucial change is in Step 3.  It emphasizes that the *value* (color) of the central block's elements dictates the corner placement, not the position *within* the central block. The \"mapping\" is implicit in the color itself. If we see color '3' somewhere inside 2x2, it means that 2x2 block with color '3' is mirrored to specific corner.\n"
