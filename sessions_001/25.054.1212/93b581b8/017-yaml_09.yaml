task: 016_mirror_central_block
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable  # Rows and columns can vary.
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      central_block:
        type: subgrid
        properties:
          dimensions: 2x2
          elements: non-zero integers
          location: varies, but contains a 2x2 block of non-zero integers.
      corner_blocks:
        type: subgrid
        properties:
            dimensions: 2x2
            elements: integers, correspond with element in Central Block.
            location: Each corner of the overall grid.
actions:
