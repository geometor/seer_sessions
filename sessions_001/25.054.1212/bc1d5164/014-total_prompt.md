## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 4 0 0 0 4 0
0 0 0 0 0 4 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 0 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC47585000>

**output:**
```
4 4 0
0 4 4
4 0 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47586E00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is larger (7x5) than the output grid (3x3). The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4) and white (0). The output grid appears to be a condensed or extracted version of the input grid, retaining only some of the yellow pixels and a specific arrangement of white pixels. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple mirroring, rotation, or direct sub-gridding. The relative position of the '4' changes, so the operation appears to involve isolating or detecting where there is a '4', and only in certain locations.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: [5, 7] # height, width
        output: [3, 3]
      elements:
        - type: pixel
          properties:
            color:
              - 0  # white
              - 4  # yellow
            position: [row, column]

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Extracts a 3x3 subgrid from the input 5x7 grid.
    logic: |
       The output grid appears to preserve a specific arrangement of color '4' from the input grid.

relationships:
- The output grid's yellow pixels (4) correspond to a subset of the yellow pixels in the input grid but the locations have changed.
- The positioning of the extracted pixels follows a consistent pattern, possibly based on relative positions in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels with the value '4' (yellow).
2. **Isolate corner 4s**: Examine the 4s and determine which are on the corners of the outermost 4 shape.
3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new 3x3 grid.
4.  **Place Extracted Pixels:** Place the identified, corner 4 pixels in the output grid at the very corners.
5. **Fill the empty cells**: Fill the remaining cells of output grid with value 0.

In summary, the rule seems to be, find the outermost "4"s, put them at the corners of a 3x3 grid and then make all other grid cells "0."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
