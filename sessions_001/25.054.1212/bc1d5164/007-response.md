Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary colors present are red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The input grid is larger (5x7) than the output grid (3x3). It appears that the output grid is derived from the input grid by some form of extraction or filtering, focusing on the red pixels and their immediate neighbors. The positions relative to corners is key.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      colors: [red, white]
      dimensions: [5, 7]  # Height, Width
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      colors: [red, white]
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Height, Width
  - name: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      color: red
      value: 2
  - name: white_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
        color: white
        value: 0

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Extracts a smaller grid from the input grid.
    parameters:
      focus: red pixels
      context: immediate neighbors

relationships:
  - type: subgrid_of
    from: output_grid
    to: input_grid
    description: The output grid is a subgrid derived from the input grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Corners:** Locate all red pixels (value 2) in the input grid that exist in the corners of any rectangle which has opposite corner also red.
2. **Find Bounding Box**: Select the smallest 3x3 box which contains red in its corners.

3.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill with contents extracted from the 3x3 box in the original image.
