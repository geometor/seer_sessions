Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of focusing on red pixels and extracting a 3x3 subgrid was too specific to the first example and doesn't generalize well. The code fails to correctly transform most of the examples because it relies on finding a very specific arrangement (a square) of red pixels, when the colors and the geometry are different in each of the training examples. The core concept of identifying corners of a shape and extracting a region is relevant, but the color and size constraints are incorrect. We need a more flexible approach that considers the common properties across all examples. We should focus on the outermost pixels of *any* color, not just red, that define a bounding rectangle, and use that to determine output size and content.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Generalize Color:** Instead of looking specifically for red (value 2), we should identify the *non-background* color(s) used to define the corners of the rectangle.
2.  **Dynamic Size:** Instead of always extracting a 3x3 grid, calculate the dimensions of the rectangle formed by the corner pixels and use that to define the output grid's size.
3. **Refine corner definition:** The initial red pixel search is returning all pixels, not a rectangle, so it is not working correctly. We need to define "corner" in a more abstract way, focusing on edge pixels that mark the boundary of a rectangle.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**
I'll summarize important features from each example.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: Rectangle of azure (8) on white (0) background.
    *   Corners: Defined by the azure pixels.
    *   Output Shape: 3x3 square extracted, azure (8) rectangle from the top-left of the shape.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: Rectangle with Red (2) corners
    *   Corners: Defined by the red pixels.
    *   Output Shape: 3x3 square extracted, containing mostly red.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: Rectangular outline of yellow (4)
    *   Corners: Defined by yellow pixels.
    *   Output Shape: 3x3, contains yellow and a single black pixel.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input shape: Rectangle outline of Yellow (4)
    *   Corners: Defined by Yellow pixels.
    * Output shape: 3x3 containing yellow and black

*   **Example 5:**
    * Input shape: Rectangular outline of Green(3)
    * Corners: Defined by green pixels
    * Output shape: 3x3 containing green and black

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

  - example: 5
    input_shape: rectangle_outline
    corner_color: green
    output_size: 3x3
    output_content: cropped_input
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the outermost bounding pixels:** Find the non-background colored pixels that form the edges of a conceptual rectangle within the input grid. Consider all non-zero colors.
2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Calculate the rectangle size from these bounding pixels:
    - The width and height will be based on the number of pixels from leftmost to rightmost and topmost to bottommost.
    - if width or height < 3, create 3x3 subgrid.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new grid of the appropriate size
    - Copy the content from the top-left corner of the detected rectangle


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
