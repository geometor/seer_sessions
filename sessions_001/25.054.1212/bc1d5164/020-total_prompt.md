## Example 4

**input:**
```
4 0 0 0 0 0 4
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
4 0 0 0 0 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7BFC47579A20>

**output:**
```
4 0 4
0 0 0
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47579AE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are yellow (4) and white (0). The input grid is larger (7x5) than the output grid (3x3). The output grid seems to be a compressed or summarized version of the input grid, retaining only the yellow pixels and their relative positions within a smaller frame. The white pixels seem to be largely ignored, acting as a background.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: [5, 7]  # height, width
        output: [3, 3]
      pixels:
        - color: yellow
          value: 4
        - color: white
          value: 0
actions:
  - type: compress
    description: Reduce the grid dimensions while preserving the relative positions of the yellow pixels.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Yellow pixels maintain their relative positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right) in both input and output.
  - type: contains
    description: Input and output contain grids.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the color yellow (value 4) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine** the bounding box that encompasses all yellow pixels. Or, determine maximum and minimum row/column.
3. **Create** a new output grid with dimensions that, relatively speaking, capture the yellow pixels in a minimal bounding box.
4. **Map** the positions of the identified yellow pixels from the input grid to the output grid. Preserve position *relative to the minimal bounding box.*
5.  **Fill** all other cells in the output grid with the color white (value 0). Essentially, the bounding box created in (2.) is fit into 3x3 grid.

In essence, the transformation extracts the "yellow subgraph" and places it into the smallest possible grid while maintaining spatial information between the colored squares.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
