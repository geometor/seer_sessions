    description: Extracts a 3x3 subgrid from the input 5x7 grid.
    logic: |
       The output grid appears to preserve a specific arrangement of color '4' from the input grid.

relationships:
- The output grid's yellow pixels (4) correspond to a subset of the yellow pixels in the input grid but the locations have changed.
- The positioning of the extracted pixels follows a consistent pattern, possibly based on relative positions in the input.
