            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is larger (7x5) than the output grid (3x3). The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4) and white (0). The output grid appears to be a condensed or extracted version of the input grid, retaining only some of the yellow pixels and a specific arrangement of white pixels. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple mirroring, rotation, or direct sub-gridding. The relative position of the '4' changes, so the operation appears to involve isolating or detecting where there is a '4', and only in certain locations.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
