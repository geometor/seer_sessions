The primary colors present are red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0). The input grid is larger (5x7) than the output grid (3x3). It appears that the output grid is derived from the input grid by some form of extraction or filtering, focusing on the red pixels and their immediate neighbors. The positions relative to corners is key.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
