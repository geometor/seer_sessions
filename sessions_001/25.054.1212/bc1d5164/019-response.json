The primary colors involved are yellow (4) and white (0). The input grid is larger (7x5) than the output grid (3x3). The output grid seems to be a compressed or summarized version of the input grid, retaining only the yellow pixels and their relative positions within a smaller frame. The white pixels seem to be largely ignored, acting as a background.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
