There's a cluster of '2' (red) pixels in the lower-middle part of the grid. The red pixels form a somewhat irregular shape.\n*   **Output:** A 6x3 grid. It contains only '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The red pixels form a more condensed and regular pattern compared to the input. There are many '2' pixels at output than input.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting, replicating, and rearranging the '2' (red) pixels, while some '0' (white) pixels also get replicated. The output grid is smaller than the input in height but longer in width.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
