            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial program was too narrowly focused on the red ('2') pixels and made incorrect assumptions about replication based solely on the first example. The second example validates the core resizing, repositioning and replicating logic. The failures on Example 1 and Example 3 reveal that the initial program doesn't generalize well to other colors. It incorrectly assumes that all non-zero pixels should determine the width, and only focuses on replicating color '2'. The program needs to be more general. It should extract a *pattern* from the bottom three rows and replicate that pattern and its color, not just the '2' pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Generalize Color Handling:** Instead of focusing only on '2', the program should handle any non-zero color in the bottom three rows.\n2.  **Correct Width Calculation**: Ensure the width includes all columns between the first and last non-zero columns in bottom three lines.\n3. **Pattern Extraction:** It identifies the pattern in bottom three rows and copy it with original color.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input size: 8x8\n    *   Expected Output size: 3x6\n    *   Actual Output size: 3x6\n    *   Pixel-wise match: False (only background pixels matched).\n    *   Identified Issue: Incorrectly processed only `0` as background. Color '8' was in the source pattern but was not identified.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input size: 8x8\n    *   Expected Output size: 3x6\n    *   Actual Output size: 3x6\n    *   Pixel-wise match: True\n    *    Identified Issue: The core process correctly identified and extracted the color '2' pattern from the bottom three lines and reproduced the pattern.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input size: 8x8\n    *   Expected Output size: 3x6\n    *   Actual Output size: 3x6\n    *   Pixel-wise match: False.\n    *    Identified Issue: The core process failed to pick up '1' as the active color in the pattern from the bottom three rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input_objects:\n    - object_1:\n        color: 8\n        shape: irregular\n        position: row 2, column 2-3; row 3, column 3; row 4, column 2-4\n  output_objects:\n     - object_1:\n        color: 8\n        shape: pattern_replication # Describe the relationship between the object in the bottom three rows of input and object in output\n        position: various, based on replication rule. # Precise locations after transformation\n  transformation:\n    - action: extract_pattern\n      source_rows: [6,7,8] # Corrected row indexing (assuming 1-based indexing for clarity)\n      source_cols: find non-zero\n    - action: replicate_pattern\n    - action: set_colors\n\nexample_2:\n  input_objects:\n     - object_1:\n        color: 2\n        shape: irregular\n        position: row 6 column 4; row 7 column 3-5; row 8 column 3-4\n  output_objects:\n     - object_1:\n        color: 2\n        shape: pattern_replication\n        position: various\n  transformation:\n    - action: extract_pattern\n      source_rows: [6,7,8]\n      source_cols: find non-zero\n    - action: replicate_pattern\n    - action: set_colors\n\nexample_3:\n  input_objects:\n    - object_1:\n        color: 1\n        shape: irregular\n        position: row 2 column 6-7; row 3 column 5; row 4 column 6\n  output_objects:\n     - object_1:\n        color: 1\n        shape: pattern_replication\n        position: various\n  transformation:\n    - action: extract_pattern\n      source_rows: [6,7,8]\n      source_cols: find non-zero\n    - action: replicate_pattern\n    - action: set_colors\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Source Rows**: Focus on bottom three rows of input.\n2.  **Determine Width:** Calculate the width of the output grid. The width is determined by the columns containing non-zero pixels within the *source rows*. Find the leftmost and rightmost columns with non-zero values. The difference between the column indices plus one sets the base width.\n3.  **Extract Pattern:** Create a new grid with a height of three rows and calculated width. Copy the color values of the pixels from the *source rows* into the new grid, maintaining their relative positions.\n4.  **Double width**: create a new grid with double the base width\n5. **Replicate Pattern:** Copy extracted pattern to the right of the original pattern.\n\n"
