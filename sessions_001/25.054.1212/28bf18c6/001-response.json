The input grid appears to be larger and sparser, containing mostly '0' (white) pixels with a small cluster of '8' (azure) pixels. The output grid is smaller, denser, and seems to be a condensed representation of the azure pixels from the input. The relative positions of the azure colored pixels in the input matrix seem important when constructing the output matrix.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
