## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7BFC441A18D0>

**output:**
```
8 8 0 8 8 0
0 8 0 0 8 0
8 8 8 8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC441A1990>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid. The input grid appears to be larger and sparser, containing mostly '0' (white) pixels with a small cluster of '8' (azure) pixels. The output grid is smaller, denser, and seems to be a condensed representation of the azure pixels from the input. The relative positions of the azure colored pixels in the input matrix seem important when constructing the output matrix.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2D grid of integers, representing colors.
  - observation: Output is a 2D grid of integers, representing colors.
  - observation: Input grid dimensions are 8x8.
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are 3x6.
  - observation: Input grid primarily contains '0' (white), with some '8' (azure).
  - observation: Output grid only contains '0' (white) and '8' (azure).
  - object: AzurePixelCluster
    properties:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: Irregular, but contiguous
    actions:
      - Condensed: Transformed into a smaller, denser representation.
    relations:
      - input_grid: Located within the input grid.
      - output_grid: Forms the basis of the output grid.
  - object: WhiteBackground
      properties:
          color: 0 (white)
      actions:
          - removed
      relations:
          - input_grid: fills most of input grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Cluster:** Locate the contiguous cluster of '8' (azure) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices occupied by the azure pixels. This defines a rectangular "bounding box" around the cluster.
3.  **Construct the output:** Extract every other value beginning with the top left corner of the cluster. Extract three rows.
4. **Fill output:** Create output from the extracted values.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
