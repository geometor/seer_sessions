## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7BFC47F93880>

**output:**
```
0 2 0 0 2 0
2 2 2 2 2 2
2 2 0 2 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC47F93C70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** An 8x8 grid. Most cells are '0' (white). There's a cluster of '2' (red) pixels in the lower-middle part of the grid. The red pixels form a somewhat irregular shape.
*   **Output:** A 6x3 grid. It contains only '0' (white) and '2' (red) pixels. The red pixels form a more condensed and regular pattern compared to the input. There are many '2' pixels at output than input.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve extracting, replicating, and rearranging the '2' (red) pixels, while some '0' (white) pixels also get replicated. The output grid is smaller than the input in height but longer in width.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        role: background
      - value: 2
        color: red
        role: foreground
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x6
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        role: background
      - value: 2
        color: red
        role: foreground
  - relation: transformation
    type: replication and rearrangement
    details:
        - The foreground object changes shape
        - Many foreground object copies are added.
        - output dimensions differ from input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels with a value of '2' (red) in the input grid.
2.  **Extract and Replicate**: Create copies of red pixels.
3. **Resize:** create a new blank grid which is height of the bottom three rows of the input and the width that is sum of leftmost and rightmost non zero column indices.
4.  **Fill**: Fill the new grid: if the input pixel value is '2', place a '2' else place '0'
5. **Replicate row 1**: copy all values from the first row to complete the new row.
6.  **Fill Top Row**: Scan across the filled row. Whereever there is a 2, copy to top row.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
