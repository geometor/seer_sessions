The input grid appears to have a single blue pixel (1) at the bottom left corner, with the rest being white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions but exhibits a checkerboard pattern of alternating white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The bottom left pixel is blue in the input and the pixel to its right is blue in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Fill the output grid with a checkerboard pattern. Iterate through each cell of the output grid, alternating between white (0) and blue (1) pixels.\n    The top-left pixel (0,0) will be 0. The coordinate to its right, (0,1) will be 1.\n    For all other pixels, the color value will be the inverse of the pixel above it.\n\nIn essence, the program replaces the whole input grid by alternating colors, with the top-left pixel as 0, and other pixels on the same row alternating, and next row starting with the inverse of the element at the start of the previous row.\n"
