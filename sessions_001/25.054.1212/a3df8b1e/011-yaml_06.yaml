  - transformation_observations:
      - "The output grid contains a diagonal pattern of blue pixels."
      - "The position of seed determines start of pattern."
      - "The diagonal wraps around both vertically and horizontally."
      - "Each row contains exactly one blue pixel."
      - "Each column will contain at least one blue pixel, but possibly more due to wrapping."
  - general_observations:
      - "The transformation preserves the dimensions of the input grid."
      - "Only colors white and blue."
