2.  **Copy and Extend Red:** Locate the horizontal red (2) object. Copy and expand to fill the row, except where the azure object is.
3.  **Create Intersection:** Find the intersection point of the extended azure line (from step 1) and the original red line (from step 2).

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of extending the azure line and filling the red line. However, the code has a critical flaw in how it handles the intersection and the red fill. It incorrectly fills the entire row with red without considering the position of the azure line, and the intersection logic is overly complex and doesn't correctly identify where to place the yellow pixel. The extension logic is a little off, it extends, but not to match the output example.

The strategy for improvement involves:

1.  **Refine Intersection Logic:** Simplify the intersection logic to directly find the shared row between the extended azure line and the red line, placing the yellow pixel there.
2.  **Conditional Red Fill:** Modify the red fill to only fill up to the column of the azure line, not the entire row.
3.  **Precise extension**: Ensure the extension goes exactly two rows below the *original* position.
4. **Generalize to other rows**: extend the red fill to the column containing the azure, regardless of its position.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on object properties and actions:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:**
        *   Azure vertical line at column 4.
        *   Red horizontal line at row 2.
    *   **Expected Output:**
        *   Azure line extended by two rows.
        *   Red line filled until column 4, then yellow pixel, then red line.
        *   Yellow pixel at intersection (row 2, column 4).
    *   **Actual Output:**
        *   Azure line extended by two rows (one additional).
        *   Red line filled across the entire row.
        *   No yellow pixel.
    *   **Issues:** Incorrect red fill, missing yellow pixel, azure extended too much.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:**
        *   Azure vertical line at column 1.
        *   Red horizontal line at row 3.
    *   **Expected Output:**
        *   Azure line extended by two rows.
        *   Red line filled until column 1.
        *   Yellow pixel at the intersection (row 3, column 1).
    *   **Actual Output:**
    *     Azure line extended by two rows (one additional).
        *   Red line filled across the entire row.
        *   No yellow pixel.
    *   **Issues:** Incorrect red fill, missing yellow pixel, azure extended too much.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: line
    color: azure
    orientation: vertical
    action: extend_down
    extension_length: 2 # relative to original end

  - type: line
    color: red
    orientation: horizontal
    action: fill_row_until_column
    stop_column_object: azure_line

  - type: pixel
    color: yellow
    location: intersection
    intersection_of: [azure_line, red_line]

grid_properties:
    background_color: white
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate and Extend Azure Line:** Find the vertical azure line in the input grid. Copy this line to the output grid. Extend this line downwards by two pixels, relative to its original end position.
2.  **Locate and Conditionally Fill Red Line:** Find the horizontal red line in the input grid. Copy the red line to the same row in the output grid. Fill the rest of that row with red, but stop before the column containing the azure line. Continue filling with red after the azure line column.
3.  **Create Yellow Intersection:** Place a single yellow pixel at the intersection of the extended azure line and the original red line. Specifically, the yellow pixel's row will be the same as the original red line, and its column will be the same as the original azure line.
4. All other cells in the output will match the corresponding cell in the input (in these examples the background is white (0)).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
