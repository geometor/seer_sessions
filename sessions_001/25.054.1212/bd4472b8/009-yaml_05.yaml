facts:
  - observation: |
      Each example has an input grid and a corresponding output grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - description: Contains initial pixel values.
      - role: source data
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - description: Contains transformed pixel values.
      - role: transformed data
  - object: first_row
    properties:
      - type: 1D array
      - description: The first row of the input grid.
      - role: source of repeated elements
  - operation: copy
    description: |
      The first two rows of the input_grid are copied to the output_grid.
  - operation: repeat_elements
    description: |
      Each element of the first row is repeated individually to create new rows.
      Each number in the top row is repeated down the grid, creating columns of values
      equal to the height of the input grid.
  - example_1:
      input_shape: (8, 3)
      output_shape: (8, 3)
      repetition_pattern: Each element in the first row is repeated to create 6 more rows.
      element_wise: true
  - example_2:
      input_shape: (10, 4)
      output_shape: (10, 4)
      repetition_pattern: Each element in the first row is repeated to create 8 more rows.
      element_wise: true
  - example_3:
      input_shape: (6, 2)
      output_shape: (6, 2)
      repetition_pattern:  Each element in the first row is repeated to create 4 more rows.
      element_wise: true
