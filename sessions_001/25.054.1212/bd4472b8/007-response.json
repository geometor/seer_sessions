The input grid appears to have two distinct regions: a top region with varied non-zero digits, and a bottom region filled entirely with zeros. The output grid retains the top two rows of the input, replaces the zero region with a repeating pattern based on the first row of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
