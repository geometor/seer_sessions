observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: (8, 3)
      output_shape: (8, 3)
      rows_to_repeat: [0, 1]
      pattern: "Repeat rows 0 and 1 sequentially until the output grid is filled."
      result: "Incorrect. The transformation only repeats the values of the first row (index 0)."

      input_shape: (10, 4)
      output_shape: (10, 4)
      rows_to_repeat: [0, 1]
      pattern: "Repeat rows 0 and 1 sequentially."
      result: "Incorrect. Same error as example 1."

      output_shape: (6, 2)
      rows_to_repeat: [0, 1]

objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: "Variable, between 1 and 30"
      - columns: "Variable, between 1 and 30"
      - cells: "Pixels with integer values 0-9, representing colors."
    actions:
      - "Copy input grid to output grid."
      - "Identify rows with all non-zero pixels before any row that contains a 0."
      - "Repeat identified rows sequentially to fill output, starting at first row that was all 0s in input."
