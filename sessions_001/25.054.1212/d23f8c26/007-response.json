The transformation seems to be a selective extraction or filtering of elements from the input grid to produce the output grid. The output grid retains certain colors/values from the input, while others are replaced with 0 (white). The spatial arrangement (row and column position) of the retained pixels appears to be preserved. The most obvious pattern is that only the center column is kept, while all other values are zeroed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
