## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 0 3 0 0
8 6 5 6 0
3 6 3 0 0
0 0 0 5 9
5 0 9 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC48E3C7C0>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 5 0 0
0 0 3 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 9 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC48A61C00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, represented by single-digit numbers.  The transformation seems to be a selective extraction or filtering of elements from the input grid to produce the output grid. The output grid retains certain colors/values from the input, while others are replaced with 0 (white). The spatial arrangement (row and column position) of the retained pixels appears to be preserved. The most obvious pattern is that only the center column is kept, while all other values are zeroed.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output are 5x5 grids of single-digit integers representing colors.
  - object: |
      Pixels are the primary objects, characterized by color (value) and position (row, column).
  - property: |
      Color values range from 0 to 9.
  - property: |
     0 represents white
  - action: |
      Pixels in center column are preserved.
  - action: |
      Pixels in all other columns are set to 0.
  - relationship: |
      Spatial positions of preserved color, row, and column are maintained between input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the center column:** In a 5x5 grid, this is the third column.
2.  **Iterate** through the input grid.
3.  **Preserve:** If a pixel is in center column, copy its value to the same position in the output grid.
4. **Set to zero:** Set all other pixel values to 0.
5.  **Output** The output will show only the center column colors, all others will be 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
