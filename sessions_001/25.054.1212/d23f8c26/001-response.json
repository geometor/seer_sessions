The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The most noticeable change is that many of the colored pixels in the input grid become white (0) in the output grid. Only two pixels retain their original color and value. There appears to be a selection process determining which pixels to keep and which to blank out. The positions of the yellow (4) and green (3) appear to remain consistent.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Locate the pixel with the value '4' (yellow) and the pixel with value of '3'(green).\n2.  **Preserve Key Pixels:** Maintain the color and position of the yellow '4' pixel and green '3' pixel in the output grid.\n3. **Blank Other Pixels:** Change all other pixels in the input grid to the color white, with the color code '0'.\n4. **construct new array:** Assemble the 3x3 output grid by applying the operation above.\n\nEssentially, the rule seems to be: \"Keep only the pixels with values '3' and '4', and set all other pixels to '0'\".\n"
