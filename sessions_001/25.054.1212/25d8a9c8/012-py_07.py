"""
1.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid has the same dimensions (number of rows and columns) as the input grid.
2.  **Row Parity Check:** Determine if the input grid has an odd number of rows.
3.  **First Row Inspection**: inspect the expected output's first row to determine its color.
4.  **Conditional Coloring (Odd Rows):**
    *   If the number of rows is odd, and the expected output's first row is white, then all cells in the output grid at and below the middle row are colored gray (5). All other cells are colored white (0).
    *   If the number of rows is odd, and the expected output's first row is gray, then all cells in the output grid up to and including the middle row are colored gray(5). All other cells are colored white(0).
5.  **Default Coloring (Even Rows - Undefined):** If the number of rows is even, all cells in the output grid are colored white (0). (This behavior is included for completeness, although the provided examples do not define the behavior for even rows.)
