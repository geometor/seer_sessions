Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Examine the bottom row of the input grid.**
    *   If all cells in the bottom row of the input have the same value (and therefore, color)
2.  **Modify the Bottom Row.** Set all values in the output grid's bottom row to the value 5 (gray).
3.  **Modify all other rows.** Set all the values in all other rows of the output grid to 0 (white)

In summary, the transformation detects if the entire bottom row of input is of the same color, it changes bottom row of the output grid all to grey, and the other rows all to white.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule."""

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Initialize output_grid to all white (0).
    output_grid[:] = 0

    # Check if the bottom row has all the same values.
    if np.all(input_grid[-1, :] == input_grid[-1, 0]):
        # Set the bottom row to gray (5).
        output_grid[-1, :] = 5

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were on the right track, focusing on the bottom row of the input grid. However, the code only correctly handles cases where *all* rows above the bottom row are supposed to be white. Example 3 reveals a flaw: only the bottom row should be gray (if uniform), and the other rows become white, *regardless* of whether the bottom row was changed or not. The original program and code missed this critical aspect of the full rule. The assessment also shows how the code performs, the primary issue being that the non-bottom rows are not ALWAYS set to white.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Core Logic:** Modify the natural language program to accurately reflect that *all* rows other than the bottom row will *always* become white. The bottom row becomes gray only if all its pixels have the same initial value (color).
2.  **Improve Specificity:** Ensure the natural language program is unambiguous.
3.  **Regenerate Code:** Based on the corrected natural language program, create new code.
4.  **Re-test:** Thoroughly test the new code against all training examples.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating more detailed observations. Let us create a report on the actual input and expected output grids using code.

```python
import numpy as np

def report_grid(grid, name):
    report = f"{name}:\n"
    report += str(grid) + '\n'
    report += f'shape: {grid.shape}\n'
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    report += f'pixel counts: {dict(zip(unique, counts))}\n'
    return report

# Example data (from the prompt)
examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[4, 4, 4], [2, 3, 2], [2, 3, 3]]),
        "expected": np.array([[5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
        "transformed": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
    },
     {
        "input": np.array([[7, 3, 3], [6, 6, 6], [3, 7, 7]]),
        "expected": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0]]),
        "transformed": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]])
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 9, 2], [4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 9]]),
        "expected": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),
        "transformed": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5]])
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 2, 4], [2, 2, 4], [1, 1, 1]]),
        "expected": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5]]),
        "transformed": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5]])
    }
]

reports = []
for i, example in enumerate(examples):
  reports.append(f'Example {i+1}:')
  reports.append(report_grid(example['input'], 'Input'))
  reports.append(report_grid(example['expected'], 'Expected Output'))
  reports.append(report_grid(example['transformed'], 'Transformed Output'))
  reports.append("-----")

for report in reports:
    print(report)
```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
- Task: 020
- Transformation_Type: Conditional Bottom Row Replacement
- Objects:
    - Input_Grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - Output_Grid: 2D array of integers (colors)
    - Bottom_Row: 1D array representing the last row of a grid
- Object_Properties:
    - Input_Grid.shape: (rows, cols) - variable
    - Output_Grid.shape: (rows, cols) - same as Input_Grid
    - Bottom_Row.elements: Integers representing colors
    - Bottom_Row.uniformity: Boolean (True if all elements are the same, False otherwise)
- Actions:
    - Check_Uniformity: Examine Bottom_Row of Input_Grid for identical values.
    - Set_Bottom_Row_Gray: If Bottom_Row.uniformity is True, set all elements of Output_Grid.Bottom_Row to 5 (gray).
    - Set_Other_Rows_White: Set all elements of Output_Grid, except those in Bottom_Row to 0 (white)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the bottom row of the input grid.**
    *   Determine if all cells in the bottom row of the input grid have the same value.
2.  **Initialize the output grid.** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, and initialize all cells to 0 (white).
3.  **Conditionally modify the bottom row of the output grid.**
    *  If all cells in the bottom row of the *input* grid had the same value, set all cells in the bottom row of the *output* grid to 5 (gray).
4.  All other rows remain at their initialized value of 0 (white).

In summary: Create an output grid that is all white, except the bottom row. The bottom row of the output is grey if and only if the bottom row of the input grid had all the same value (color). Otherwise the bottom row will also be white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
