objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    cells:
      - properties:
          value: integer (0-9)
          color: mapped from value
          location: row, column coordinates

observations:
  - input_bottom_row:
      values: [1, 1, 1]
      color: blue
  - output_bottom_row:
    values: [5,5,5]
    color: grey
  - input_other_rows:
    values_row_1: [2,2,4]
    values_row_2: [2,2,4]
    colors: [red, red, yellow]

actions:
    - bottom_row_change_to_grey: all values in the bottom row are replaced by 5 (gray) if they are all the same color and value
    - other_rows_change_to_white: all values in other row are replaced by 0 (white)

relationships:
  - bottom_row_input_output: The change in the bottom row's color appears to relate to bottom row of the input and is a different color from input.
  - other_row_input_output: the change from red/yellow to all white appears to be a consistent operation.
