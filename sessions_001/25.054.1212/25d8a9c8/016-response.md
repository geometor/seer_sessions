"""
The transformation rule performs a color mapping on the input grid to produce the output grid. The following color transformations are applied:

1.  Orange (7) becomes White (0).
2.  Green (3) becomes White (0).
3.  Gray (6) becomes Gray (5).
4.  Red (2) becomes White (0).
5.  Maroon (9) becomes White (0).
6.  Yellow (4) becomes Gray (5).
7.  Blue (1) becomes Gray(5).

Essentially, the color changes consolidate several related colors into color
that is similar, and makes many of the colors white.
