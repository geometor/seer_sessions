The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input grid has a variety of colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors to mainly blue and gray.  The blue (1) pixels in the top row remain unchanged. The other colors seem to be replaced based on their adjacency, specifically it looks like any non-blue pixel adjacent to an azure(8) is replaced with grey(5)\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
