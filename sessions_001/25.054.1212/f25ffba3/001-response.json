The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x4). There are several distinct colors present: white (0), maroon (9), green (3), red (2), and yellow (4). The most noticeable change is the rearrangement of the rows. A distinct colored object, the vertical line composed by values 3 and 9 on right border seems to stay.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
