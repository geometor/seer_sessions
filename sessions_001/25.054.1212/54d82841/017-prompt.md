Previous Code:
```python
"""
The output grid is the input grid with a new row added to the bottom. The values in the new row are determined by the values in the third row from the bottom of the input grid. If a cell in the third row from the bottom of the input is non-zero, a '4' is potentially placed in the corresponding column of the new row. Only one '4' is placed in the output row for each distinct non-zero color in the third to last input row. If a cell in the third-to-last row of the input is '0', a '0' is placed in the corresponding column of the new row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
