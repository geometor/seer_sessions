## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x512 at 0x7BFC47503760>

**output:**
```
0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6
0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0 0 4 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The primary colors observed are white (0) and magenta (6). The transformation seems to involve a very specific, localized change at the bottom of the grid, introducing yellow (4) pixels. The magenta pixels appear unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 8
      columns: 8
      cell_values: [0-9] # Representing colors
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color:
            - white # 0
            - magenta # 6
            - yellow # 4
          position: [row, column] # (x,y) coordinates

actions:
  - type: replace_color
    description: "Change color of specific pixels"
    parameters:
        original_color: 0 #white
        new_color: 4 #yellow
        locations: [[7,2],[7,6]]

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid."
  - type: conditional_change
    description: "Specific white pixels at certain bottom row locations are transformed to yellow, the rest is unchanged"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Context:** We have an 8x8 grid of pixels, primarily white (0) and magenta (6).

2.  **Transformation:**
    *   Locate two specific white pixel at the bottom row (row index 7). One at column index 2, and the other at column index 6.
    *   Change color of pixels in those locations to yellow (4).
    *   All other pixels remain unchanged.

3.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the two specified pixels at the bottom, which are now yellow.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
