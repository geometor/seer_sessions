"""
The entire input grid is copied to the output grid. A new row is added at the bottom of the output grid. For each cell in the newly created row (starting from the left):
    *   If the cell above it, two rows up in the original row 3, is not 0, and it is the first cell in the output with this condition, then the new cell value is set to 4.
    *   If the cell, two rows up in original row 3 is not 0, and a previous cell in the output in the new row is 4, skip to the next one, unti a new cell with color not 0 is reached, set this to 4.
    *  If the cell above and two rows up is 0, then the new cell's value is set to 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
