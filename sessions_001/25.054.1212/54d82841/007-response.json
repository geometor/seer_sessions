The input grid transforms into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary change appears to be the introduction of a single yellow (4) cell in the output, while the other cells mostly remain the same. The location of the yellow cell seems related to the position of green (3) cells.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
