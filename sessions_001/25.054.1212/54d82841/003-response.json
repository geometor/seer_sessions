            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the errors:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too specific, assuming a fixed grid size (8x8) and hardcoded pixel locations ([7, 2] and [7, 6]). This works for the first example but fails for others with different dimensions. The core issue is that the code doesn't dynamically adapt to the input grid's size and structure. The strategy should be to generalize the pixel selection process, making it relative to the grid's dimensions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Dynamic Row Selection:** Instead of assuming row 7, determine the last row index dynamically using `input_grid.shape[0] - 1`.\n\n2.  **Conditional Pixel Modification:** Change the hardcoded column location to a conditional, that is, set last row, locations x,y to 4 only if the value is 0, and otherwise to 4.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: 8x8\n    *   Output Size: 8x8\n    *   Result: Success (Match)\n    *   Notes: The initial code correctly handles this case because the input matches the hardcoded assumptions.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x5\n    *   Output Size: 5x5\n    *   Result: Error (IndexError: index 7 is out of bounds)\n    *   Notes: The code fails because it tries to access row 7, which doesn't exist in a 5x5 grid.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: 5x7\n    *   Output Size: 5x7\n    *   Result: Error (IndexError: index 7 is out of bounds)\n    *   Notes: Similar to Example 2, the code attempts to access a non-existent row.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The transformation involves changing the color of specific pixels in the last row of the input grid.\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      type: 2D array\n      values: integers representing colors (0-9)\n      dimensions: variable height and width\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      type: 2D array\n      values: derived from input_grid\n      dimensions: same as input_grid\n  - action: color_change\n    details: |\n        Pixels at specific locations in the last row of the input grid have their color changed to yellow (4) if it is white (0).\n  - constraints:\n        The output grid dimensions are always equal to the input.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Obtain the dimensions of the input grid.\n2.  Identify the last row of the grid.\n3.  Locate the 3rd and 7th pixels on the last row.\n4.  If the pixel value on the last row, 3rd from the left, and 3rd from the right are white (0), change them to yellow (4)\n\n"
