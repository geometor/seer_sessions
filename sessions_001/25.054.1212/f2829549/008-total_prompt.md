## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 7 0 1 5 0 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0
7 7 0 1 5 0 0
0 7 7 1 5 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x256 at 0x7BFC47F93310>

**output:**
```
0 0 3
3 3 3
0 0 3
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x7BFC47587E20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of a different size and with different pixel values. The input grid appears to have a pattern of colors, while the output grid seems to simplify this pattern, focusing on a single color. The input grid is 4x7 and the output grid is 4x3.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x7
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1, 5, 7]  # white, blue, gray, orange
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [0, 3]  # white, green
  - action: transformation
    description: transforms input_grid to output_grid
    details:
      - size_change: Input grid's width is reduced.
      - color_change: Certain colors are replaced by others.
      - pattern: a vertical column within the input becomes a main element of the output.
  - object: blue_column
    type: column
    location: input_grid
    column_index: 3
    properties: solid color (1/blue)
  - relationship: correspondence
    entity1: blue_column
    entity2: output_grid
    description: input grid blue colum matches output grid green
  - observation: output colors
    details: values are limited to 0, and one derived from the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Key Column:** In the input grid, locate the single solid-color vertical column of pixels. In this instance it is the blue column.

2.  **Extract and Transform:** Isolate this column. The output grid's width will matches the height (number of rows) of the input. The color of the selected column is changed to the target color (green).

3.  **Construct Output:** Create the new output grid that is the height of the input but the number of columns is the number of rows in the key column.

4.  **Fill Background:** Fill all the cells in the output area around the green with white (color 0). The target color pixels now form a single vertical line on the right of the output grid and the remaining output grid is color 0.

In essence, the transformation identifies a special column, changes the color to the target color, rotates and places it as the rightmost column, and fills the remaining area with color 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
