The input grid appears to have a pattern of colors, while the output grid seems to simplify this pattern, focusing on a single color. The input grid is 4x7 and the output grid is 4x3.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this instance it is the blue column.\n\n2.  **Extract and Transform:** Isolate this column. The output grid's width will matches the height (number of rows) of the input. The color of the selected column is changed to the target color (green).\n\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create the new output grid that is the height of the input but the number of columns is the number of rows in the key column.\n\n4.  **Fill Background:** Fill all the cells in the output area around the green with white (color 0). The target color pixels now form a single vertical line on the right of the output grid and the remaining output grid is color 0.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies a special column, changes the color to the target color, rotates and places it as the rightmost column, and fills the remaining area with color 0.\n"
