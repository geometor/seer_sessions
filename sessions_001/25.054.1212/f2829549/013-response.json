The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from specific patterns or objects in the input grid. The input grid appears to contain a vertical line of blue (1) pixels, and various other colored pixels, particularly orange (7) and gray (5). The output grid contains green (3) and white (0) pixels. There's a reduction in dimensions from the input to the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
