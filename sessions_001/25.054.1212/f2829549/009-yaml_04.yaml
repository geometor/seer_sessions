facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid size is not always the same as the input grid size.  The
      relationship between input and output sizes is inconsistent. Sometimes
      the height is copied, other times the width.
  - observation: |
      A solid-color column (specifically, blue) exists at index 3 in all input
      grids.
  - observation: |
      The output grid always contains a green column, but its position varies
      (index 0, 1, or 2).
  - observation: |
      The output grid has other elements besides the green, other pixels,
      including white checkerboard patterns.
  - observation: |
      There is a blue column at index 3 of the input grid, but the output
      grids are all colored with white and green.
  - observation: |
      The presence of the solid color column in the input appears to be important, but other components of the input appear to dictate parts of the transformation.
