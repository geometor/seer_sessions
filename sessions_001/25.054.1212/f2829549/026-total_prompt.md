## Example 5

**input:**
```
7 0 0 1 0 5 0
0 0 7 1 5 0 0
0 0 0 1 5 5 5
7 7 7 1 5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x256 at 0x7BFC47F93310>

**output:**
```
0 0 3
0 3 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x256 at 0x7BFC48A61A50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and creating a natural language program:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 4x7 grid with single-digit integer values (colors). There are distinct horizontal bands of colors. Orange (7), white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) are present.
*   **Output Grid:** A 4x3 grid, smaller than the input. It contains only white (0) and green (3). The green appears to correspond to the locations of orange and blue in the input, but is not a simple 1-1 replacement.
* **Transformation:** The output grid's dimensions (4x3) appear connected to the input. The height matches, and the width seems to be derived somehow. The output colors don't directly map to the input colors; there seems to be a selection or summarization process. The green (3) color is NOT present in the input, this is important. The output grid height matches the input. The width has decreased by more than half.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: [4, 7]
    colors: [0, 1, 5, 7]
    color_names: [white, blue, gray, orange]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: [4, 3]
    colors: [0, 3]
    color_names: [white, green]

  - type: observation
    description: Output grid height matches input grid height.
    input_property: height
    output_property: height

  - type: observation
    description: Output grid width is less than half of the input grid width, plus one.
    input: input width
    output: output width

  - type: observation
    description: Green (3) appears in the output grid where orange (7) or blue (1) was present in the columns used from the input grid.
    input_colors: [7, 1]
    output_color: 3

  - type: observation
    description: The specific columns used appear to be the first, the fourth, then the sum of the unique values of the two columns
    input_colors: [7, 1]
    output_color: 3

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid with the same height as the input grid. The width of the output will be calculated in the next step.

2. **Calculate Columns to Isolate, and the output width:**
    * Take the first column from the Input
    * Take the fourth column from the input
    * Take the element-wise sum of the two selected columns, replace any non-zero result with the color green (value 3)
    * The width of the output is equal to the number of columns selected (3).

3.  **Populate Output:**
    *   Iterate through each row of the derived columns.
    *   Transfer the results of the calculations directly into the output.

4.  **Result:** The output grid is a summarized representation, where orange (7) and blue(1) combine as green(3)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
