Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of a different size and with different pixel values. The colors are represented by integers, and the overall transformation appears to be a simplification or abstraction of the original image. The change in dimensions indicates some form of downsampling or summarization.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 4x7 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Output grid is 4x3 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Input grid contains colors: orange (7), white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors: white (0) and green (3).
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [4, 7]
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [4, 3]
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - relationship: output_grid appears to be a simplified representation of the input_grid.
  - action: color_substitution
    details: Specific colors in the input are replaced by other specific colors in the output.
  - action: downsampling
    details: The width of the grid is reduced, likely by focusing on a specific area or pattern.
  - property_change:
    object: grid
    property: dimensions
    before: [4,7]
    after: [4,3]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus on a Sub-region:** Examine the leftmost 3x3 sub-grid within the 4x7 input grid.
2. **Color Mapping**:
    *   If any cell in column 1,2 or 3 is orange (7), in the same row set that cell to green (3).
    *   Otherwise if cell is 0,1,5 keep color as white(0).

Essentially, the transformation extracts the initial 3 columns of each row of
the 4x7 input and perform simple color substitution.
