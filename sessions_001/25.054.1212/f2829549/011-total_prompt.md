Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid by creating a checkerboard pattern of white (0) and green (3)
cells in the output grid. The output grid's height is the same as the input grid's
height.  The width of the output is either input_height or input_height - 1. The 
checkerboard starts with white at [0, 0].  The orientation of the checkerboard
(which color goes where) is derived from a checkerboard pattern found in the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
