facts:
  - task: 022
  - input_grid_size: varies (9x3 in examples)
  - output_grid_size: constant (3x3)
  - output_content: subgrid of input
  - subgrid_selection: "Not strictly bottom-most.  Appears to be top-left in some cases."
  - example_2_error: "Output was bottom-most 3x3, expected was top-left most."
  - example_4_error: "Output was bottom-most 3x3, expected was top-left most."
  - possible_rule: "Select a 3x3 subgrid based on a yet-to-be-determined criterion."
  - repeating_pattern_identified: "Repeating 3x3 patterns may indicate a more general selection rule"
