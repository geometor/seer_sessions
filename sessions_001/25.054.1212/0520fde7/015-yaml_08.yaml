    description: >
        Divides input grid rows into three equal zones, even if the division is not perfect (e.g.
        with input rows 5, the mapping will be zone 1: [0,1], zone 2: [2,3] and zone 3: [4,5]).
        Each zone will be associated to the output rows in order.

    description: "Find horizontal runs of blue pixels (1) adjacent to the gray stripe, either on the left or right side. Only consider blue pixels within each of the mapped row zones."

  - name: place_red_pixels
    input: [output_grid, blue_segments,row_mapping]
    output: output_grid
    description: >
        For each output row: if there are blue pixels adjacent to the gray stripe in
        the corresponding input rows, place a red pixel.  The horizontal
        location is 0 if the blue segment is on the left, and 2 if on the
        right.  If a region contains blue segments both on the left *and* right, place
        two red pixels (left and right). Only place one red pixel per side.
