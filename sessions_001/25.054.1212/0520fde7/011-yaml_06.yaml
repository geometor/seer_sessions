facts:
  - task_id: "010"
  - input_objects:
      - description: Input grid of varying size, containing pixels of different colors.
        properties:
          - colors: [0, 1, 5]  # white, blue, grey
          - shape: Variable, up to 30x30
  - output_objects:
      - description: Output grid of fixed size (3x3), containing only white and red pixels.
        properties:
          - colors: [0, 2]  # white, red
          - shape: (3, 3)
  - transformations:
      - description: Grey pixels in the input are transformed to red pixels in the output; all others are changed to white.
        details: >
          The position of a red pixel in the output corresponds to the
          position of the Nth grey pixel in the input, considering only the
          first three grey pixels found, row by row. If a row contains gray,
          a red pixel is placed at column index corresponding to the order
          (first, second, third, from the left) that the grey pixel appeared
          within that input.
          All other pixels in output are white. The output size is always 3x3.
