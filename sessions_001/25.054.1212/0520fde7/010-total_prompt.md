Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and code were too narrowly focused on the first training example. It correctly identified the column containing the grey (5) pixel and attempted to extract information from that column. However, it failed to generalize the mapping logic to the other examples correctly. Specifically, it's consistently placing the red (2) pixels in the *second* column of the output, rather than placing it based on where in the grey column the 5s are. It also does not correctly map the non 1s.

The core issue is that the code is *always* placing the resulting '2' values in the *middle* column (`output_grid[i, 1]`). This needs to be corrected to dynamically determine the output column based on some context which it currently does not understand. The examples seem to all produce 3x3 outputs with only one column holding information.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all three input/output pairs to identify the *precise* relationship between the grey (5) pixel's position in the input and the red (2) pixel's position in the output. It looks like the output uses just the information of each row separately.
2.  **Refine the Program:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect this relationship. The updated program should focus on a row-by-row transformation.
3.  **Prepare for Code Update:** Use clear and concise language in the natural language program, which will make translating it into code straightforward.

**Metrics and Reports:**

Here's a summary of each example's results:

| Example | Match | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Palette Correct | Pixel Counts Correct | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------ | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | False | 2          | True         | True            | False                | Incorrectly places all red pixels in the second column. Doesn't correctly handle 0s.                                                                 |
| 2       | False | 2        | True         | True            | True                 | Incorrectly places all red pixels in the second column. The number of red and white are correct by coincidence.                                                  |
| 3       | False | 5          | True         | True            | False                | Incorrectly places all red pixels in the second column. Doesn't handle 0s and 1s correct, placing all 0s. Number of 2s is coincidentally correct.       |

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Map values in the row containing grey (5) to a 3x3 output grid."
  - input_objects:
    - description: "Input grid with varying dimensions, containing digits 0-9."
      properties:
        - colors: "Represents colors based on digit values (0-9)."
        - key_color: "Grey (5) acts as a marker."
  - output_objects:
    - description: "A 3x3 output grid."
      properties:
        - size: "Always 3x3."
        - colors: "Contains only white (0) and red (2)."
  - transformations:
    - description: "Row-wise mapping based on the input."
      rules:
        - "If a row contains the number 5, transform and include in the output"
        - "If a row in input has 5, set to 2 in output at the same x coordinate"
        - "All other input pixels on that row transform to 0"
  - constraints:
      - "output is always 3x3"
      - "only map rows with a 5"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate through Rows:** Examine each row of the input grid independently.
2.  **Check for Grey:** For each row, check if it contains the value 5 (grey).
3.  **Transform Row (if grey exists):** If the row contains a 5, create a new row for the output grid:
    *   Iterate through the input row.
    *   If a value in that row is 5 (grey), place a 2 (red) in the corresponding position of the output row.
    *   For all other values in the input row, place a 0 (white) in the corresponding position of the output row.
4.  **Output Grid:** Assemble the transformed rows into a 3x3 output grid. If there are fewer than three rows to transform, fill in default rows of all 0.

This revised natural language program accounts for the row-wise transformation and the conditional mapping of values and should produce the correct results. It correctly interprets the position of the '5' within each row as determining the position of the '2' in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
