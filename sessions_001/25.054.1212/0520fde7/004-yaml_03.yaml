facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain various colors, with gray (5) playing a key role.
  - observation: |
      Output grids predominantly feature black (0) with red (2) in specific locations.
  - observation: |
      The transformation is not a simple color substitution in the same location.
  - observation: |
      The positions of red pixels in the output relate to the positions of gray pixels in the input, but not directly.
  - observation: |
        The relationship is very likely a 180 rotation of the grid, with color transformation of gray to red, others to black.

  - action: color_transformation
    details: Gray (5) in input becomes Red (2) in output; other colors become Black (0).
  - action: grid_rotation
    details: The input grid appears to be rotated 180 degrees to form the output grid.
