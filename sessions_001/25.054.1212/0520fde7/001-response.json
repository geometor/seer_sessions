The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The output grid contains only white (0) and red (2). The output grid appears to be a simplified or abstracted representation of the input grid, focusing on a specific feature. The red pixel (2) in the center of the output might represent a specific characteristic or pattern in the input. The position (center) of the red pixel, and its relation with the surrounding gray column in input may be a key.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
