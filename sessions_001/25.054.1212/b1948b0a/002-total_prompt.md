## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 6 7 6
6 6 7 7
7 7 6 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7BFC47546EF0>

**output:**
```
2 2 7 2
2 2 7 7
7 7 2 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7BFC47546350>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x4). The colors in the input grid are magenta (6) and orange (7). The output grid has the same shape, but some of the magenta (6) pixels are changed to red (2), while the orange (7) pixels remain unchanged. The core task appears to be a selective color replacement based on the original color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
  - dimensions:
      rows: 3
      columns: 4
  - input_colors:
    - 6: magenta
    - 7: orange
  - output_colors:
    - 2: red
    - 7: orange
  - transformation_rule:
      color_change:
        - from: 6
          to: 2
      color_no_change:
        - 7
  - object_interaction: none # No apparent interaction between objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of the current pixel.
3.  **If** the pixel's color is magenta (6), **change** it to red (2) in the output grid.
4.  **If** the pixel's color is orange (7), **keep** it the same (7) in the output grid.
5.  **Output** contains the transformed grid.

Essentially, the program is: *Replace all magenta pixels with red pixels, leave orange pixels unchanged.*

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
