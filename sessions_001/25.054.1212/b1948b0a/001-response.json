The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x4). The colors in the input grid are magenta (6) and orange (7). The output grid has the same shape, but some of the magenta (6) pixels are changed to red (2), while the orange (7) pixels remain unchanged. The core task appears to be a selective color replacement based on the original color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
