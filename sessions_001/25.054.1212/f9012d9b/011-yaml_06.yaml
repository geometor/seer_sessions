example1:
  input:
    shape: (5, 5)
    objects:
      - pattern: "repeating 2x1 blocks horizontally"
        colors: [1, 2] # Main colors in the repeating pattern.
        repeat_start: [0,0]
  output:
    shape: (2, 2) #expected, not the actual result
    region: "center"
    extraction: "2x1 block, top-left element is at (0,1) in original matrix, taking columns 1 and 2 (starting index 0) from original matrix"

example2:
  input:
    shape: (4, 4)
    objects:
      - pattern: "alternating colors"
        colors: [8, 6]
  output:
    shape: (1, 1)
    region: "top-left"
    extraction: "single pixel"

example3:
  input:
    shape: (7, 7)
    objects:
      - pattern: "central 2x2 block identifiable, no clear repeating smaller pattern"
        colors: [2,5]
  output:
    shape: (2, 2)
    region: "center"
    extraction: "2x2 block"
