The colors present in the input are red (2), gray (5), and white (0). The output grid seems to be significantly smaller than the input grid. The specific arrangement and colors in the output suggest a relationship with *specific* regions or colors in the input, not a simple downscaling or averaging.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If any gray present, then fill output grid with gray.\n     * Look for color red (2) within same. If any red present, then fill the remaining slot on output with red.\n\n3. **Construct Output:** Create the output using the color identified using the above rules.\n\nIn essence, the program seems to extracting information from a few distinct regions and their properties. The specific color and arrangement are crucial, suggesting a rule-based extraction rather than a calculation.\n"
