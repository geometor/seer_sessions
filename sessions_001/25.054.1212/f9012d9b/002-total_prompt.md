## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 2
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 2 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4890A200>

**output:**
```
1 1
2 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC47F93610>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The colors are represented by integers (0-9), with a known mapping to specific colors (e.g., 0 is white, 1 is blue, 2 is red). The input grid appears to have a variety of colors, while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on a subset of colors and potentially their arrangement or count. The key seems to be identifying a pattern or rule that dictates which parts of the input grid are represented in the output, and how. It seems that only the colors blue(1) and red(2) from the top left corner are in output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 5x5 grid of colored pixels.
  - observation: Output is a 2x2 grid of colored pixels.
  - observation: Colors in the input include white (0), blue (1), and red (2).
  - observation: Colors in the output are blue (1) and red (2).
  - property: Input grid dimensions are larger than output grid dimensions.
  - relationship: Output grid appears to represent a condensed version of the input, possibly selecting a region.
  - action: Top left 2x2 corner is extracted.
  - colors: The colors of the extracted corner make the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Region:** Focus on the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the input grid.
2.  **Extract Subgrid**: Copy the color values from the top left 2x2 of input into output


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
