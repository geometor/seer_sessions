Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Repeating Color Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify repeating color blocks. A color block can be a single pixel or a larger contiguous area of the same color. Focus on the smallest repeatable unit.

2.  **Determine Representative Colors:** In example 2, the expected output is a single pixel representing the top-left color of the input. The rule seems to use the first occurrence of the color in the smallest repeatable unit.

3.  **Locate the Color Blocks:** In the input locate all examples of colors identified in step 2.

4. **Reconstruct:** If there are multiple colors, and multiple objects in the input, reconstruct the blocks, but using only colors identified in the repeatable units.

5. **Output**: output should only contain the colors from the smallest repeating pattern.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The current code is based on identifying the smallest repeating unit in the input grid and then using the colors within that unit to construct the output.  However, it's making several incorrect assumptions:

1.  **Shape of Output:** It assumes the output will either be the size of the smallest repeating unit or, in the case of a single-color unit, a 1x1 grid. The examples clearly show this isn't always true. The output shape seems related to a *portion* of the repeating unit, not the whole unit itself, and certainly not the *colors* of the repeating unit.
2.  **Color Selection:** While it correctly identifies the colors in the repeating unit, it doesn't correctly use them. The output isn't just a rearrangement of the repeating unit's colors. The second example, with single color output, is misinterpreted.
3. **Origin**: The origin of the repeating unit is assumed to be the top-left -
    this is not true in all cases.

The core strategy needs to shift from reconstructing the entire repeating unit to identifying a *sub-pattern* within the repeating unit, and replicating *that*. The dimensions of the output grid seem to represent counts of things in a certain
arrangement.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Focus on Sub-Patterns:** Instead of simply finding the *smallest* repeating unit, we need to find the smallest repeating unit and then identify meaningful sub-patterns *within* that unit. These sub-patterns dictate the output.
2.  **Re-evaluate Output Shape:** The output shape is likely determined by the dimensions of the significant sub-pattern within the repeating unit, and the colors of the sub-pattern, not the repeating unit.
3.  **Correct Color Use:** Determine how colors from the sub pattern of the repeating unit are mapped to the output.
4. **Origin**: Consider the origin of the repeating unit.

**Metrics and Observations (using prior code execution results):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Observed Output Shape: (1, 5)
    *   Repeating Unit: `[[2, 1], [1, 1]]`
    *   Repeating Unit Shape: (2,2)
    *   Sub-Pattern: Appears to be the first column of repeating unit `[[2],[1]]`, or first two rows `[[2, 1]]`
    *   Notes: The code incorrectly used the entire repeating unit and it's colors.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (1, 1)
    *   Observed Output Shape: (1,4)
    *   Repeating Unit: `[[8, 6], [6, 8]]`
    *   Repeating Unit Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Sub-Pattern: The entire input is a checkerboard, the expected output is the top-left element.
    *   Notes: Code misinterpreted single color result.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Observed Output Shape: (1, 7)
    *   Repeating Unit: `[[2, 2, 5], [2, 2, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`
    *   Repeating Unit Shape: (3, 3)
    *   Sub-Pattern: It appears that the sub pattern may be the last column `[[5], [5], [5]]` rotated 90 degrees, and the two unique colors are used, with '2' added in the final position.
    *   Notes: The output shape and color usage are incorrect, although repeating unit is identified.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the Smallest Repeating Unit:** Determine the smallest rectangular unit that repeats to form the entire input grid.

2.  **Identify Sub-Pattern:**
    *   **Example 1 Hypothesis:** The sub-pattern is the first column (or first two rows) of the repeating unit.
    *  **Example 2 Hypothesis:** The sub pattern is the top-left element
    * **Example 3 Hypothesis:** The sub-pattern is the unique colors of the repeating
      unit, with the last color repeated.

3.  **Determine Output Shape:** The output shape is determined by the sub-pattern's dimensions.

4. **Determine Origin**: the origin of the repeating unit may be the top-left, or
    it may be another location.

5.  **Extract Sub-Pattern Colors:** Extract the colors from sub-pattern.

6.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid using colors of the sub pattern and dimensions of the sub pattern.

7. **Return output:** Return sub-pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
