"""
1.  **Identify 3x3 Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify all 3x3 square blocks of pixels where all pixels have the same color.

2.  **Find the Uppermost Block with a Block Below:** Among the identified blocks, find the block that has another identified block directly below it, and is the highest block that does so.

3.  **Extract the Block:** Extract the identified block as a 3x3 grid.

4. **Output:** If no such block is found, return None.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
