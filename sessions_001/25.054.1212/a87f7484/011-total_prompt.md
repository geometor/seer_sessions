Previous Code:
```python
# Hypothetical usage (This will *not* run)
from code_execution import analyze_grid

analysis_results = []
for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(train_examples):  # Assuming train_examples is available
    transformed_output = transform(input_grid)
    analysis = analyze_grid(input_grid, output_grid, transformed_output)
    analysis_results.append(analysis)

print(analysis_results)

```

Train Set Results:

## Example 1:

Input:
```
None
```
Expected Output:
```
None
```
match: None
pixels_off: None
size_correct: None
color_palette_correct: None
correct_pixel_counts: None
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, delivered as a structured report:

**General Assessment:**

The initial attempt hasn't yielded runnable code, and we only have `None` values for the first example's analysis. This is expected as we haven't actually processed any data yet. The core strategy is sound: we'll analyze input-output pairs, deduce the transformation rule in natural language, and then translate that into Python code. The provided `analyze_grid` function (hypothetical in the last code block, needs to be implemented) is crucial for comparing the transformed input with the expected output and providing detailed feedback. Since no actual input/output data has been provided. All initial analysis data has been skipped. We need to get actual data to be able to solve the problem.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

Since we do not have task data to analyze at this stage. I will describe a general approach.

1.  **Provide Input/Output Data:** The most critical step is to receive the actual input and output grids for the training examples. Without this, no analysis or deduction is possible.

2.  **Implement `analyze_grid`:** A concrete implementation of `analyze_grid` is needed. This function should compare:
    *   **Pixel-by-pixel correspondence:** Identify exactly which pixels differ in color between the expected output and the output produced by the `transform` function.
    *   **Grid dimensions:** Check if the output grid has the same height and width as the expected output.
    *    **Color Palettes**: Check the colors used.
    *   **Object Analysis:** (Longer-term) If the grids contain distinct objects (contiguous regions of the same color), `analyze_grid` should ideally also compare object properties (size, position, shape) between the expected and generated outputs.

3.  **Iterative Refinement:**  We'll proceed example by example.
    *   Start with the first training example. Develop a *provisional* natural language program.
    *   Implement a `transform` function based on that program.
    *   Use `analyze_grid` to compare the transformed input with the *expected* output.
    *   Based on the `analyze_grid` results, refine the natural language program and the `transform` function.
    *   Move to the next training example, repeating the process.  The goal is to create a program that works correctly for *all* training examples.
    * Test the final program against test data.

**Metrics and Analysis (Hypothetical):**

Once the input/output data and a functional `analyze_grid` are available, we'll generate reports like this (using example 1 as a placeholder):

```
Example 1 Analysis:
- Input Grid: [Provided Input Grid Here]
- Expected Output Grid: [Provided Expected Output Grid Here]
- Transformed Output Grid: [Output of transform(input_grid)]
- Match: True/False (overall match between transformed and expected)
- Pixels Off:  [(row1, col1, expected_color1, actual_color1), (row2, col2, ...), ...]
- Size Correct: True/False
- Object Differences: (If applicable)
  - Object 1:  Size difference, position difference, etc.
  - Object 2: ...
```

We'll repeat this for each training example.  The `pixels_off` list will be particularly valuable for identifying the *specific* errors the `transform` function is making.

**YAML Fact Block (Hypothetical - will be populated with real data later):**
Because no I/O pairs are provided I am unable to create facts. Here is a general layout that I will use later.

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    objects: [] # Example: [{shape: rectangle, color: blue, position: (0, 0), size: (2, 3)}]
    grid_size:
      width: 0
      height: 0
  output:
    objects: []
    grid_size:
      width: 0
      height: 0
  transformations: [] # Example: [{type: move, object_id: 1, direction: down, amount: 2}]

example_2:
  input:
    objects: []
    grid_size:
       width: 0
       height: 0
  output:
    objects: []
    grid_size:
       width: 0
       height: 0
  transformations: []

# ... and so on for other examples
```

**Natural Language Program (Hypothetical - Placeholder):**

Again, I am unable to create a program without task examples.
Here is a generic format.

```
1.  **Initial Observation:** Describe the overall goal or pattern, if apparent.  (e.g., "The output seems to be a simplified version of the input," or "The output is a mirrored version of the input").
2.  **Object Identification:**  If applicable, describe how to identify the relevant objects in the input. (e.g., "Find all contiguous blue regions," or "Identify the largest rectangle").
3.  **Transformation Steps:** Describe, step-by-step, how the input objects are modified to create the output.  Be precise! Use terms like:
    *   "Move object X to position (Y, Z)."
    *   "Change the color of object X to color Y."
    *   "Resize object X to dimensions (Y, Z)."
    *   "Rotate object X by N degrees."
    *   "If object X is adjacent to object Y, then..."
    *   "Remove object X"
4. **Grid Properties:** Note any overall grid changes.
5. **Assumptions:** Explicitly mention any assumptions.

```

**Next Steps:**

The absolute next step is to receive the training data (input and expected output grids) for all examples. Once that data is available, I can proceed with the analysis, fact documentation, and program development outlined above.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
