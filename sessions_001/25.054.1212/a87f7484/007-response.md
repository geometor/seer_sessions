Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller grid. The input grid appears to have a variety of colors, while the output grid is predominantly orange (7) and white (0). The size reduction is significant (from 12x3 to 3x3). The key seems to be extracting a specific color, potentially based on its position or relationship to other colors. It is not obvious at first glance, but only orange is perserved from the input to output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [12, 3]  # Input grid dimensions
      elements: integers #representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]   # Output grid dimensions
      elements: integers

colors_present:
  input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 7] #white, blue, red, green, orange
  output: [0, 7] # white, orange

actions:
    - select:
        color: 7 #orange
        logic: unknown #positional, relational, etc.

    - create_grid:
        dimensions: [3,3]
        elements_from_selection: true
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels of color orange (7) in the input grid.
2.  **Observe** relative position and relationships, with special attention to the surrounding white spaces (0).
3.  **Create** a 3x3 output grid.
4.  **Fill** the output grid using the spatial arrangement and the distribution pattern of orange as the main reference.
5.  **Complete** the output using white (0) as needed.

In other words. Extract all orange (7) colored pixels. If an orange pixel is present at input\[x,y], place it at output\[x%3, y%3], and fill other places with white.
