1.  **Initial Observation:** Describe the overall goal or pattern, if apparent.  (e.g., "The output seems to be a simplified version of the input," or "The output is a mirrored version of the input").
2.  **Object Identification:**  If applicable, describe how to identify the relevant objects in the input. (e.g., "Find all contiguous blue regions," or "Identify the largest rectangle").
3.  **Transformation Steps:** Describe, step-by-step, how the input objects are modified to create the output.  Be precise! Use terms like:
    *   "Move object X to position (Y, Z)."
    *   "Change the color of object X to color Y."
    *   "Resize object X to dimensions (Y, Z)."
    *   "Rotate object X by N degrees."
    *   "If object X is adjacent to object Y, then..."
    *   "Remove object X"
4. **Grid Properties:** Note any overall grid changes.
5. **Assumptions:** Explicitly mention any assumptions.
