The input grid appears to have a variety of colors, while the output grid is predominantly orange (7) and white (0). The size reduction is significant (from 12x3 to 3x3). The key seems to be extracting a specific color, potentially based on its position or relationship to other colors. It is not obvious at first glance, but only orange is perserved from the input to output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
