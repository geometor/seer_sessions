Colors include magenta (6), white (0), yellow (4), and azure (8). There are distinct rectangular blocks of magenta, yellow, and azure, all surrounding a white pixel in their centers.\n*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid, which appears to be a cropped section of the input. Specifically, it's the azure (8) block from the bottom of the input grid, including the central white (0) pixel.\n*    the output is a subset of the input\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific colored block (azure, in this instance) and extracting it. The criterion for selection of the block seems that, if a block has other blocks above it, only the lowest is selected.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
