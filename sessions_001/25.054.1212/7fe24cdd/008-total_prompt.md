## Example 2

**input:**
```
3 8 2
3 2 2
8 5 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC4754ACE0>

**output:**
```
3 8 2 8 3 3
3 2 2 5 2 8
8 5 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 5 8
8 2 5 2 2 3
3 3 8 2 8 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x7BFC4754B5E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid appear to be replicated and rearranged in the output grid. There's a sense of mirroring or reflection, and possibly rotation, involved in the transformation. The output grid seems to be a patterned expansion of the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3x3, 6x6]
      cells: [integers, 0-9] # Representing colors
    actions:
      - expansion
      - replication
      - rearrangement # Possibly mirroring/rotation
    relationships:
      - input_grid: "Smaller 3x3 grid"
      - output_grid: "Larger 6x6 grid, derived from input"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide and Conquer:** Imagine dividing the output 6x6 grid into four equal 3x3 quadrants.

2.  **Top-Left Quadrant:** The top-left quadrant of the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid.

3.  **Top-Right Quadrant:** The top-right quadrant is a mirrored copy (reflection across the vertical axis) of the input grid.

4.  **Bottom-Left Quadrant:** The bottom-left quadrant is a mirrored copy (reflection across the horizontal axis) of the input grid.

5.  **Bottom-Right Quadrant:** The bottom-right quadrant is a double-mirrored copy (reflection across both vertical and horizontal axes) of the input grid. This is same as 180 degree rotation of input grid.

In essence, the input grid is replicated four times, with each quadrant of the output grid being either a direct copy or a mirrored version of the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
