The colors present in the input grid (white/0, green/3, magenta/6) are also present in the output grid. The output grid appears to be a mirrored and expanded version of the input grid, with some kind of alternating pattern. It seems like each pixel in the input grid \"expands\" to occupy more space in the output, creating a 2x2 pattern that could represent interaction, like a cross product.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
