The current hypothesis about the precise pixel mapping within the enlarged grid is incorrect. The precise mapping between input and output pixels is more complex than simple replication. Each pixel from the input grid appears to influence multiple locations, and this must be solved. The current understanding is flawed and needs a new hypothesis based on close comparisons between all given examples.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid with double the dimensions of the input_grid.\n    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape\n    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2\n    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)\n\n    # The following is a placeholder based on the *incorrect* assumption of 2x2 replication.\n    # It needs to be replaced with the correct mapping logic once determined.\n    for i in range(input_height):\n        for j in range(input_width):\n            # Get the color of the current pixel.\n            color = input_grid[i, j]\n\n            # Placeholder: Incorrectly replicate the pixel to a 2x2 block.\n            output_grid[2*i:2*i+2, 2*j:2*j+2] = color\n            # Needs to be replaced by the correct mapping logic!\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
