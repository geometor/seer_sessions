"""
The transformation rule takes a 3x3 input grid and expands it into a 6x6 output grid. The width and height are doubled. The current hypothesis about the precise pixel mapping within the enlarged grid is incorrect. The precise mapping between input and output pixels is more complex than simple replication. Each pixel from the input grid appears to influence multiple locations, and this must be solved. The current understanding is flawed and needs a new hypothesis based on close comparisons between all given examples.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (simple 2x2 replication of each input pixel) is clearly incorrect. The transformed outputs share the correct dimensions and color palettes with the expected outputs, and even maintain the correct number of pixels for each color, but the pixel arrangements are wrong. This suggests a more complex spatial transformation is at play, one that still adheres to a consistent rule but isn't a straightforward expansion. The key is to discern a pattern in how *each individual input pixel* influences the *arrangement* of pixels in the output grid, not just their presence. The transformation seems to interweave the expanded pixels, creating an "alternating" or "shifting" pattern, rather than a simple block replication.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Focus on Pixel Mapping:** Instead of thinking about blocks, we need to trace the "fate" of each individual input pixel.  For each input pixel at coordinates (i, j), we must determine *all* the coordinates in the output grid that it affects.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** We will meticulously compare the input and expected output grids for *all* examples. We'll look for consistent patterns in how input pixels at different positions map to output pixels. It might be helpful to visualize the mappings (e.g., draw arrows from input pixels to their corresponding output pixels).
3.  **Consider Row/Column Relationships:** The transformation may involve separate rules for how rows and columns are handled. There might be an alternating pattern, or a shift based on row/column index.
4. **Discard previous assumptions:** The previous assumption was shown to be incorrect so we should ignore it going forward.

**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution when needed):**

I will focus on the positions of the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Double Dimensions:** The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions (both width and height).

2.  **Interwoven Expansion:** Each pixel in the input grid influences a *pattern* of pixels in the output grid. The influence is *not* a direct 2x2 block replication. It seems to have a component that depends on position, but the precise relationship must be determined and confirmed.

3.  **Positional Mapping:**
    *   The mapping is complex and involves multiple output pixels for each input pixel. A clear, concise, and universally applicable rule needs to be derived.

The most critical next step is refining the "Positional Mapping" part. The current description is still too vague. I need to determine a precise formula or algorithm that dictates the output pixel locations based on the input pixel coordinates and color, and that holds true across *all* examples. A key improvement from the previous iteration is the shift in focus from block replication to individual pixel mapping. The YAML attempts to capture specific mappings, but a generalizable rule is still missing.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
