## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4423CB20>

**output:**
```
2 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 2 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 6 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC4423F670>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid (likely a 2D array) of single-digit integers, where each integer represents a color.  The input grid transforms into an output grid of the same dimensions.  There are specific color changes and apparent spatial relationships that seem important. The colors present are:

*   0 (white)
*   2 (red)
*   6 (magenta)
*   1 (blue)

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - elements: integers (0-9)
    actions:
        - transform_grid: grid changes state between input and output

  - object: color_regions
    description:  areas of a single or same color.
    properties:
       - color_value: integer repesenting the color
    actions:
        - change_color:  specific color changes
          input:
             red: 2
             white: 0
             magenta: 6
          output:
             red: 2
             blue: 1
             magenta: 6
             white: 0 and 1

  - object: spatial_relationships
    description:  relationship of non-white colors to each other
    properties:
      - top_red_exists: there is a red object in the top row
      - red_regions:  two non-contiguous red regions, colored 2
    actions:
       - fill_blue:
          from:  top red regions, each
          to:  down and right, except where blocked

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Locate all pixels with the value 2 (red) in the top row.

2.  **Propagate Blue:** For each red pixel identified in step 1, change all the white connected regions to its right and all white region below to blue (value 1). Stop when a colored block stops the spread.

3. **Preserve other colors.** The red and magenta pixels keep the original values.

In short, the top-row red pixels "seed" a blue fill operation to the right, and downwards. Other colors remain.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
