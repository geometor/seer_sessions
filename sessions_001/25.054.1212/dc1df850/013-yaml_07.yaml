objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (4x5 in the example)
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9, representing colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer value
      - position: (row, column) coordinates
    instances:
      - red_pixel:
          color: 2 (red)
          position: (1, 1) in input, (1,1) in output

actions:
  - name: surround_pixel
    description: Surrounds a target pixel with pixels of a specific color.
    parameters:
      - target_color: 2 (red)
      - surrounding_color: 1 (blue)
      - boundary: The operation does not extend beyond the boundaries of the initial image, top and left only.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Defines which pixels are considered neighbors. In this case, the surrounding cells on the top and left sides as well as the immediate diagonals.
