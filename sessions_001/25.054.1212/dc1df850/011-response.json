            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of detecting \"L\" shapes formed by a red pixel and two adjacent white pixels, then flood-filling from the white pixels, is partially correct. However, it's overly sensitive and incorrectly triggers flood fills in many cases. The main issue is that the flood fill expands *too much*, including both adjacent and diagonal pixels, leading to large areas being incorrectly colored blue. The L-shape detection logic also needs refinement, as it can initiate multiple flood fills from the same red pixel.\n\nThe core problem stems from a too-broad definition of \"adjacency\" during the flood fill. It should only fill directly adjacent (up, down, left, right), not diagonally adjacent white pixels. The \"L\" shape detection is also too permissive.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Restrict Flood Fill:** Modify the `flood_fill` function to only consider directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) and not diagonal ones.\n\n2.  **Improve L-Shape Condition:** Refine the L-shape condition logic for a more specific and robust solution.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to reflect the corrected logic.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of observations from each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid\n    *   Expected Output: Some white (0) pixels adjacent to a red (2) \"L\" change to blue (1).\n    *   Actual Output: Too many pixels change to blue. The flood fill expanded diagonally, which it shouldn't have.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 8x8 grid\n    *   Expected Output: Similar to Example 1, white pixels near red \"L\" shapes are turned to blue.\n    *   Actual Output: Almost the entire grid is turned blue. The flood fill has propagated excessively.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 4 x 5\n    *   Expected output: a 3x3 block of blue, with the red pixel in the center\n    *   Actual Output: similar to example 2, filled too much.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: red_pixel\n    color: 2\n    role: initiator\n    properties:\n      shape: single pixel\n  - name: white_pixel\n    color: 0\n    role: target\n    properties:\n      shape: single pixel\n  - name: blue_pixel\n    color: 1\n    role: result\n    properties:\n      shape: single pixel\n  - name: L_shape\n    description: One red pixel and two adjacent white pixels forming an \"L\".

The \"L\" can be in any orientation.\n3. **Adjacent Flood Fill** If an \"L\" shape made of one red and two white pixels is found, perform a flood-fill operation:\n    *   Start the flood fill on the white pixels of the l.\n    *   Change the color of the white pixel to blue (1).\n    *   Continue the flood fill to any *directly adjacent* (up, down, left, or right) white pixels, changing them to blue.  Do *not* fill diagonally adjacent pixels.\n    *   Stop when no more directly adjacent white pixels can be filled.\n4.  **Preservation:** All pixels that are not white or red in an identified L-shape should retain their original color.\n"
