The input grid is transformed into the output grid. The primary element to focus on seems to be the single red pixel (value '2') in the input. Its position and surrounding pixels seem to be key to the transformation. The output introduces blue pixels (value '1') in a specific pattern related to the red pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
