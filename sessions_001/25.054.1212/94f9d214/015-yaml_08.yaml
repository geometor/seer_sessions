facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is divided into two halves vertically. Only the top half is processed.
  - observation: |
      The transformation detects horizontal transitions from white (0) to green (3).
  - observation: |
      A red (2) pixel is used to mark some aspect of detected transitions.
  - observation: |
      The output grid has the same width as the input and half the height.

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      values: integers (0-9), primarily 0 and 2
  - action: transition_detection
    input: input_grid (top half)
    process: detect horizontal white-to-green
