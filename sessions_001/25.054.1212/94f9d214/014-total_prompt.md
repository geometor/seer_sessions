## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 3 3 0
0 3 0 3
0 0 3 0
3 3 3 3
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
0 1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x512 at 0x7BFC4890A4A0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 2 0
0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7BFC48908160>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have two distinct regions: an upper region with green (3) and white (0) pixels, and a lower region with blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid is smaller and mostly white (0), with two red (2) pixels appearing in specific locations. The positions of the red pixels in the output seem to correspond to the positions of color changes (from 0 to 3) within the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 8x4 (height x width).
  - observation: Output grid is 4x4 (height x width).
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 3 (green).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 0 (white) and 2 (red).
  - object: Input_Grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 8
      width: 4
      colors: [0, 1, 3]
  - object: Output_Grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 4
      colors: [0, 2]
  - action: extract_color_transitions
    input: Input_Grid
    description: Identifies positions where the color changes horizontally (left-to-right) from 0 to 3 in the top half and marks corresponding positions with color 2 (red) on the output grid.
  - relationship: Output_Grid size is a function of Input_Grid top half size. Specifically, height is half of input, width the same.
  - relationship: Red pixels in Output_Grid corresponds to color change from white to green on the top half of the input.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Define Output Grid Size:** Create an output grid that is half the height of the input grid and the same width. Initialize all cells of output grid to 0 (white).
2. **Input Grid Halving:** Consider only the top half of the input grid.
3. **Scan Input Top-Half:** Iterate through each row of the top half of the input grid.
4. **Horizontal Transition Detection:** Within each row from step 3, from left-to-right, check for a color transition from 0 (white) to 3 (green).
5. **Mark Output:** If a 0-to-3 transition is detected at position (row, col) in input, set the value of the output grid at position (row, col) to 2 (red).
6. **Output:** Return the modified output grid.

In essence, the program detects horizontal transitions from white to green in the top half of the input grid and marks those locations with red in a smaller output grid. The bottom half of input is ignored.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
