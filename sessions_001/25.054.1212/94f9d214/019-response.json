The input grid contains two distinct subgrids separated by a few rows. The first subgrid has digits `3` and `0`, while the second one is comprised of digits `1` and `0`. The output grid contains only `0`s, with a single `2` in it. The output grid is the same size as the first sub-grid from the input. The position of the `2` in output grid somehow corresponds with position of non-zero and zero values in the input grids.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The first section goes from the top of the grid until the last row that starts with a non-zero and non-one number. In the provided data this is row index `0` to `3`. The next section starts from first row that begins with either `0` or `1` until the end of the grid.\n2.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the first identified section of the input.\n3. **Locate Critical Input Cell** Find the `0` in first section of input grid which is surrounded by most `3`'s, including diagonals.\n4.  **Check Corresponding Cell in Second Section**: Check value in second section of input with same coordinates as `0` identified in previous step. If this value is `1`, this is location of non-zero value `2` for the output grid.\n5.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid of the determined size, filled with 0s.\n6. **Find matching coordinate** Find the coordinates in input grid top section where value is `0` AND surrounded by maximum number of `3` AND the same coordinates in bottom section contains a `1`.\n7.  **Populate Output:** Place a `2` in the output grid at the coordinates of `0` found in previous step. All other cells in the output grid remain 0.\n"
