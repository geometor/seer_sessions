The input grid contains pixels of colors corresponding to the values 0, 1, and 3 (white, blue, and green). The output grid contains pixels of colors corresponding to the values 0 and 2 (white and red). The output grid is smaller in dimensions (4x4) compared to the input grid (8x4). There is a clear reduction and color change. The positions of non-white pixels also change.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The reduction is performed by taking 2x1 blocks of the input and making them a single pixel.\n\n2.  **Disappearance:** The blue and the green regions disappear\n\n3. **Red Region Creation:** The red regions are created on the output grid based on following this algorithm:\n   *   Iterate every 2 rows, for every 4 columns on each row.\n   *   If any of the pixel with value 3 (green) is detected within that 2 x 4 sub-grid, put a red pixel (value 2) at the coordinate of the input sub-grid divided by 2.\n   *   if any pixel with value 1 is detected, and no pixel with value 3 is detected, and the blue pixel is the last value within that block, put a red pixel with value 2 at the top left coordinate of the input subgrid divided by 2.\n4. **Background:** The white background (0) remains unchanged where there are no red pixels.\n"
