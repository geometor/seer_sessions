## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 7 0
0 0 7
0 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7BFC47F93DC0>

**output:**
```
0 7 0 0 7 0
0 0 7 7 0 0
0 7 7 7 7 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7BFC47F93D30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid. The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 3x6. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0) and orange (7). The transformation seems to involve some form of duplication and insertion of additional white and orange pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 7] # white, orange
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x6
    elements: [0, 7] # white, orange
  - action: horizontal_expansion
    description: The width of the grid is doubled.
  - observation: orange_pattern_duplication
    description: The pattern of orange (7) pixels in each row is maintained and duplicated in the expanded section.
  - observation: white_insertion
    description: new white (0) pixels are added beside any white pixels and to pad rows
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand the Grid:** Double the width of the input grid to create the output grid.
2.  **Duplicate Orange Pattern:** For each row, identify the positions of the orange (7) pixels. In the output grid, maintain the orange pixels in their original positions.
3.  **Insert White Pixels:** add white pixels beside white, copy the new orange pixels to be after the originals.

Essentially, the transformation doubles the width, copies the orange pattern to the right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
