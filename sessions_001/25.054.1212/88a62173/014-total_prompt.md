## Example 3

**input:**
```
8 8 0 0 8
8 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0
8 8 0 8 8
8 0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47548430>

**output:**
```
0 8
8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC4754A230>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller 2D grid. The colors present are primarily azure (8) and white (0). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern, although it's not perfectly consistent. The output grid is significantly smaller and seems to retain a simplified version of the checkerboard pattern. The dimensions of the input are 5x5, and the output is 2x2.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0, 8]  # white, azure
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 2x2
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0, 8] # white, azure

actions:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Simplification of grid while preserving a general alternating pattern

relationships:
 - type: spatial
   description: Input grid contains a roughly checkerboard pattern.
 - type: correspondence
   description: output grid seems to capture top-left 2 x 2 corner with alternating pattern
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core Pattern:** Observe the general alternating pattern of azure (8) and white (0) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Extract Representative Subgrid**: Focus the top-left 2x2 sub-grid that contains core alternating pattern.
3. **Translate**: Create output grid by taking the alternating pattern elements from 2x2 sub-grid.

In essence, the transformation extracts a 2x2 representation of the larger, somewhat checkerboard-like input grid by taking top-left corner and using it's simplified 2x2 pattern.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
