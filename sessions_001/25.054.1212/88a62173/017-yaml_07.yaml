  - description: "Each quadrant of the input corresponds to a specific pixel in the output."
    type: "quadrant_mapping"
    mapping:
      - "Input Quadrant 0 (Top-Left) -> Output Pixel (0, 0)"
      - "Input Quadrant 1 (Top-Right) -> Output Pixel (0, 1)"
      - "Input Quadrant 2 (Bottom-Left) -> Output Pixel (1, 0)"
      - "Input Quadrant 3 (Bottom-Right) -> Output Pixel (1, 1)"
  - description: "The color of each output pixel is determined by the most frequent color within its corresponding input quadrant."

  - description: "There are ties in frequency in example 1 Quadrant 0, Example 1 Quadrant 3, and Example 3 Quadrant 3."
