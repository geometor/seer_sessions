            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the initial code output to develop a natural language program and a YAML block describing the transformation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focuses on extracting grid properties (height, width, unique colors, color counts, and the top-left 2x2 subgrid). This approach is useful for gathering information, but it doesn't directly describe the *transformation* from input to output. The provided code execution results are `None` because the code only analyzes, doesn't transform. The core task is to identify the upper left 2x2 section after performing a specific object selection and reduction. The current code does not attempt to identify the rule. It gives information about the inputs and outputs but doesn't compare them in a way that identifies the rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Transformation:** The output consistently appears to be a 2x2 grid. This, and a close visual inspection strongly, suggests that the transformation involves extracting a specific 2x2 region from the input.\n2.  **Determine the Selection Rule:** The key is figuring out *which* 2x2 region is selected. By observation, only the non-black (non-zero) colored squares from the top left 3x3 section are selected, and the others are discarded. Then of those, we are selecting the upper left 2x2 section.\n3. **Metrics Gathering:**\n    *   We need to locate the colored squares from the top left 3x3 section.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (using observations and reasoning, no code execution needed at this point):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid.\n    *   Relevant Feature: The top-left 3x3 contains the non-black squares:\n        ```\n        [0, 2, 0],\n        [2, 2, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n        ```\n      The non-black squares are:\n        ```\n        [ , 2,  ],\n        [2, 2,  ],\n        [ ,  ,  ]\n        ```\n      Taking the top left 2x2 of that gives:\n        ```\n        [2, 2],\n        [2, 0]\n        ```\n    *   Output: 2x2 grid, as expected.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid.\n        ```\n        [1, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n        ```\n      The non-black squares are:\n        ```\n        [1,  ,  ],\n        [ , 1,  ],\n        [ ,  ,  ]\n        ```\n      Taking the top left 2x2 of that gives:\n\n        ```\n        [1, 0],\n        [0, 1]\n        ```\n    *   Output: 2x2 grid, as expected.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid.\n      The top-left 3x3 contains the non-black squares:\n        ```\n        [8, 8, 0],\n        [8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n        ```\n      The non-black squares are:\n        ```\n        [8, 8,  ],\n        [8,  ,  ],\n        [ ,  ,  ]\n        ```\n      Taking the top left 2x2 of that gives:\n        ```\n        [8, 8],\n        [8, 0]\n        ```\n    *   Output: 2x2 grid, as expected.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: d511f180\n  - observations: |\n      All input grids are 5x5.\n      All output grids are 2x2.\n      The output grids appear to be a subsection of the input grids.\n      The output grids contain colors present in the input grid, plus black.\n      The non-black values seem to come from a specific region, with a maximum of 2 from each row and column.\n  - objects:\n      - name: input_grid\n        type: grid\n        properties:\n          - dimensions: 5x5\n      - name: output_grid\n        type: grid\n        properties:\n          - dimensions: 2x2\n      - name: selection_region\n        type: subgrid\n        properties:\n          - dimensions: 3x3\n          - location: top-left corner of input_grid\n  - actions:\n    - name: select_non_black_pixels\n      description: Identify and select the non-black pixels within the selection region.\n    - name: extract_top_left_2x2\n      description: Get the top-left 2x2 of the selection.\n    - name: output_result\n      description: Output this 2x2 grid.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Selection Region:** Consider the 3x3 subgrid at the top-left corner of the input grid.\n2.  **Discard Black Pixels:** Remove any black (value 0) pixels.\n3.  **Extract:** Extract the 2x2 subgrid at the top-left corner of the reduced selection.\n4.  **Output:** The resulting 2x2 grid is the output.\n"
