The colors present are primarily azure (8) and white (0). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern, although it's not perfectly consistent. The output grid is significantly smaller and seems to retain a simplified version of the checkerboard pattern. The dimensions of the input are 5x5, and the output is 2x2.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
