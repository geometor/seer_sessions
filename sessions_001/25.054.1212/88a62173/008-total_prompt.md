## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 1 0
1 1 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7BFC47548430>

**output:**
```
1 0
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7BFC4754A920>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain numerical values, which represent colors (0 for white, 1 for blue). The output seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on specific features or patterns. It appears that the presence and arrangement of blue (1) pixels in the input are crucial for determining the output. The output grid only has blue and white cells, much like the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - values: [0, 1]  # white, blue
      - description: "Represents the initial state"

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x2
      - values: [0, 1] # white, blue
      - description: "Represents the transformed state"

  - name: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: 1
      - color: blue

  - name: white_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - color: white

actions:
    - type: condensation
    - description: "The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid."
    - agent: "unknown rule"

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
  - description: "The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a specific rule, seemingly focusing on the blue pixels."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into four quadrants, as evenly as possible, with an overlap if dealing with the 5x5 input. In a 5x5 grid: Quadrant 1 is top-left 3x3, Quadrant 2 is top-right 3x3, Quadrant 3 is bottom-left 3x3, and Quadrant 4 is the bottom-right 3x3.

2.  **Check for Blue:** For each quadrant, check if there is at least one blue pixel (value 1) present.

3. **Condense to Output**: Each "quadrant" of the original image corresponds to one cell in the output.
  - If the quadrant contains at least one blue pixel, the corresponding output cell should be blue (1).
  - If a quadrant contains NO blue cells at all (i.e all white pixels), then the corresponding output cell should be white (0).
4. **Construct output**: Form the 2x2 output grid, setting cells based on the above, where each cell matches the output of step 3.

In short terms, the output is a 2x2 grid where each cell is blue if the corresponding quadrant in the input has at least one blue cell; otherwise, the cell will be a white one.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
