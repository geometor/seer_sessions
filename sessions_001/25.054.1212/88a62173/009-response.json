            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code are on the right track conceptually. The idea of dividing the input grid into quadrants and condensing information into a 2x2 output grid is correct. However, the original program was too specific, focusing only on blue (value 1). The provided examples demonstrate that the logic should apply to *any* non-white (non-zero) color present in each quadrant, and the specific non-zero color of the output should match any non-zero values found in the input quadrant. The current implementation correctly identifies the quadrants but fails to correctly represent the dominant color when it is not blue.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Quadrant Logic:** Maintain the existing quadrant division logic, as it correctly divides the input grid.\n2.  **Generalize Color Detection:** Modify the logic to detect *any* non-zero color within a quadrant, not just blue (1).\n3.  **Correct Color Output**: Ensure that the color used for the 2x2 output is taken from the any non-zero color detected in the corresponding input quadrant.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, aided by some imagined \"code execution\" to clarify certain points (since I can't actually execute the code in this environment):\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Expected Output Colors: {0, 2}\n    *   Actual Output Colors: {0}\n    *   Analysis: The code failed to detect and propagate the red (2) color from the quadrants. It only checked for blue.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Expected Output Colors: {0, 1}\n    *   Actual Output Colors: {1}\n    *   Analysis: While the code correctly identified the presence of blue, it incorrectly filled a quadrant. The top-right quadrant of the input does *not* contain any 1's, so output (0,1) should be 0.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Expected Output Colors: {0, 8}\n    *   Actual Output Colors: {0}\n    *   Analysis: Similar to Example 1, the code failed to detect and propagate the azure (8) color.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: 008_task\n  - input_grid_size: variable\n  - output_grid_size: 2x2\n  - quadrant_division:\n      description: Input grid is divided into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).\n      method: Integer division of rows and columns by 2.\n  - color_check:\n      description: Each quadrant is checked for the presence of any non-zero color.\n      logic: if any pixel value in quadrant != 0\n  - output_value:\n      description: The output cell corresponding to a quadrant takes the value of the non-zero pixel.  If there are no non-zero colors, it takes a zero value.\n      logic: output_pixel = input_quadrant.first_non_zero_pixel #Conceptual\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into four quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. The midpoint for division is calculated by integer division of the number of rows and columns by 2.\n2.  **Inspect:** For each quadrant, examine all pixel values.\n3.  **Detect Non-Zero:** If *any* pixel within the quadrant has a non-zero value, record the *first* non-zero value found.\n4.  **Output:** Create a 2x2 output grid. For each cell in the output grid:\n    *   If a non-zero value was found in the corresponding input quadrant, set the output cell to that non-zero value.\n    *   If no non-zero value was found (all pixels are 0/white) in the input quadrant, set the output cell to 0 (white).\n\nThis revised natural language program accounts for the presence of any non-zero color and accurately describes the transformation. It prioritizes using the *first* detected non-zero value, if present, to set the output cell's value.\n"
