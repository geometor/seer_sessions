Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to be a simple, consistent numerical mapping. Each number in the input grid is replaced by a different, specific number in the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - role: input
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: integers (0-9)
      - role: output

actions:
  - type: mapping
    description: Each integer in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding integer in the output grid.
    details:
        - 3 -> 4
        - 1 -> 5
        - 2 -> 6
relationships:
  - type: direct_correspondence
    description:  The input and output grids have the same shape and size. The transformation is element-wise.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:** Replace each integer in the input grid according to the following mapping:
    *   Replace '3' with '4'.
    *   Replace '1' with '5'.
    *   Replace '2' with '6'.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid with the replaced integers.

In simpler terms, add 1 to each number in the input to generate the output.
