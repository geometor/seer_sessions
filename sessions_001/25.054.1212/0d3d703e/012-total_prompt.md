The program implements a simple color substitution. It takes a 3x3 grid of colored pixels as input.  For each pixel in the input grid, the program performs the following:

2.  If the color is red (2), replace it with magenta (6).
3.  If the color is green (3), replace it with yellow (4).
4.  If the color is azure (8), replace it with maroon (9).
5.  Maintain the original grid structure.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a simple color substitution, but it's incomplete. It only correctly handles the second example, indicating the color mapping is not fully defined and/or some other, unstated, rule is missing. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine the input and expected output of *all* examples to deduce the complete color mapping.
2.  **Refine the mapping:** Update the `color_map` in the code with the complete set of color substitutions.
3.  **Check Grid Structure:** Verify that the grid structure is maintained and that no unexpected changes in size or shape are introduced. This is already happening in the existing code, but we must ensure it's correct.
4. **Rewrite natural language program** Fully describe all steps in the process.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To understand what the code is actually doing, I'll create a small execution harness and display results. I will use numpy arrays to represent input, and I will define the `transform` function using the code already developed, so I can check any ideas about the code against the reported results:

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid by applying a color substitution cipher.
    """
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # define the color mapping
    color_map = {
        2: 6,  # red to magenta
        3: 4,  # green to yellow
        8: 9   # azure to maroon
    }

    # iterate through the grid and apply the color mapping
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[i, j] in color_map:
                output_grid[i, j] = color_map[output_grid[i, j]]

    return output_grid

# Example 1
input1 = np.array([[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]])
expected1 = np.array([[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]])
transformed1 = transform(input1)
print("Example 1:")
print("Input:\n", input1)
print("Expected:\n", expected1)
print("Transformed:\n", transformed1)
print("Match:", np.array_equal(transformed1, expected1))
print("-" * 20)

# Example 2
input2 = np.array([[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]])
expected2 = np.array([[6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9], [6, 4, 9]])
transformed2 = transform(input2)
print("Example 2:")
print("Input:\n", input2)
print("Expected:\n", expected2)
print("Transformed:\n", transformed2)
print("Match:", np.array_equal(transformed2, expected2))
print("-" * 20)

# Example 3
input3 = np.array([[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]])
expected3 = np.array([[1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2], [1, 9, 2]])
transformed3 = transform(input3)
print("Example 3:")
print("Input:\n", input3)
print("Expected:\n", expected3)
print("Transformed:\n", transformed3)
print("Match:", np.array_equal(transformed3, expected3))
print("-" * 20)

# Example 4
input4 = np.array([[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]])
expected4 = np.array([[8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6]])
transformed4 = transform(input4)
print("Example 4:")
print("Input:\n", input4)
print("Expected:\n", expected4)
print("Transformed:\n", transformed4)
print("Match:", np.array_equal(transformed4, expected4))
print("-" * 20)
```

```
Example 1:
Input:
 [[3 1 2]
 [3 1 2]
 [3 1 2]]
Expected:
 [[4 5 6]
 [4 5 6]
 [4 5 6]]
Transformed:
 [[4 1 6]
 [4 1 6]
 [4 1 6]]
Match: False
--------------------
Example 2:
Input:
 [[2 3 8]
 [2 3 8]
 [2 3 8]]
Expected:
 [[6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]]
Transformed:
 [[6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]
 [6 4 9]]
Match: True
--------------------
Example 3:
Input:
 [[5 8 6]
 [5 8 6]
 [5 8 6]]
Expected:
 [[1 9 2]
 [1 9 2]
 [1 9 2]]
Transformed:
 [[5 9 6]
 [5 9 6]
 [5 9 6]]
Match: False
--------------------
Example 4:
Input:
 [[9 4 2]
 [9 4 2]
 [9 4 2]]
Expected:
 [[8 3 6]
 [8 3 6]
 [8 3 6]]
Transformed:
 [[9 4 6]
 [9 4 6]
 [9 4 6]]
Match: False
--------------------
```

The tests confirm the previous results. Now, let's determine the full mapping:

*   **Example 1:** 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6
*   **Example 2:** 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 9
*   **Example 3:** 5 -> 1, 8 -> 9, 6 -> 2
*   **Example 4:** 9 -> 8, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6

Combining these, we get the complete mapping:

*   1 -> 5
*   2 -> 6
*   3 -> 4
*   4 -> 3
*   5 -> 1
*   6 -> 2
*   8 -> 9
*   9 -> 8

7 maps to nothing, and 0 is not used. It appears to be a cyclical or patterned substitution, not just random one-to-one mappings.

**Natural Language Program:**

The program implements a color substitution cipher. It transforms an input grid of colored pixels into an output grid of the same dimensions by applying the following transformation to each pixel:

1.  **Maintain Grid Structure**: The output grid has the same shape (height and width) as the input grid.

2.  **Color Substitution:** Each pixel's color in the input grid is replaced with a different color in the output grid according to the following mapping:
    *   Red (2) becomes Magenta (6)
    *   Green (3) becomes Yellow (4)
    *   Azure (8) becomes Maroon (9)
    *   Blue (1) becomes Grey(5)
    *  Yellow(4) becomes Green(3)
    *   Grey (5) becomes Blue(1)
    *  Magenta(6) becomes Red(2)
    * Maroon(9) becomes Azure(8)
    * White (0) and Orange(7) are unused, and if present, will be unchanged.

3.  **Iteration:** The transformation is applied to each pixel in the input grid independently.

In simpler terms: The program takes a grid of colored pixels and changes the color of each pixel according to a specific, predefined color-swapping rule, while keeping the overall grid structure the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
