            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for resolving the errors in the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple one-to-one mapping derived from the first training example. However, subsequent examples reveal that this mapping is incorrect. The code needs to be updated to reflect the *actual* mapping, which is different, based on analyzing all the provided input/output pairs. The initial approach of using a dictionary to define the mapping is valid, but the mapping values are not accurate and should be corrected. Example 2, 3 and 4 show that there is not a match, so a revised mapping must be determined and generalized to cover all of the examples provided.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all Examples:** Carefully examine all input/output pairs in the training set to deduce the correct one-to-one mapping between input and output pixel values.\n2.  **Update Mapping:** Modify the `mapping` dictionary in the code with the correct values discovered in step 1.\n3.  **Retest:** Re-run the code with the updated mapping on all training examples to ensure it produces the expected outputs.\n4. Iterate, if necessary.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting key observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6], [4, 5, 6]]`\n    *   Initial Observation: 3 -> 4, 1 -> 5, 2 -> 6.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 8]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[6, 4, 8], [6, 4, 8], [6, 4, 8]]`\n    *   Initial Observation: 2 -> 6, 3 -> 4, 8 -> 8. Note 8 does not map to 9.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6], [5, 8, 6]]`\n    *    Initial Observation: 5 -> 5, 8 -> 8, 6 -> 6.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2], [9, 4, 2]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[9, 3, 6], [9, 3, 6], [9, 3, 6]]`\n    *    Initial Observation: 9 -> 9, 4 -> 3, 2 -> 6.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: |\n      The transformation is a one-to-one pixel value mapping. Each pixel in the input grid is mapped to a corresponding pixel in the output grid based on its color value.\n  - input_objects:\n      - description: Input grid of pixels.\n        properties:\n          - Each pixel has a color value (0-9).\n  - output_objects:\n      - description: Output grid of pixels.\n        properties:\n          - Each pixel has a color value (0-9).\n  - actions:\n      - description: Map each input pixel value to its corresponding output pixel value according to the following rule, derived from careful comparison of all input and output grids.\n        mapping_rule:\n          - 0: 0\n          - 1: 5\n          - 2: 6\n          - 3: 4\n          - 4: 3\n          - 5: 5\n          - 6: 6\n          - 7: 7\n          - 8: 8\n          - 9: 9\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Input:** A grid of pixels, each with a color value from 0 to 9.\n2.  **Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid, determine its corresponding output pixel value using the following mapping:\n    *   0 maps to 0\n    *   1 maps to 5\n    *   2 maps to 6\n    *   3 maps to 4\n    *   4 maps to 3\n    *   5 maps to 5\n    *   6 maps to 6\n    *   7 maps to 7\n    *   8 maps to 8\n    *   9 maps to 9\n3. **Output**: Create a new output grid using the correct pixel mappings.\n\n"
