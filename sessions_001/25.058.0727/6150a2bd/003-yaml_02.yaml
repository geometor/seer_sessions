- observation: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
- transformation: Rotation
- rotation_direction: Clockwise
- rotation_angle: 90 degrees
- input_object_type: 2D Grid
- output_object_type: 2D Grid
- input_dimensions: Variable (rows, cols)
- output_dimensions: Transposed (cols, rows)
- relationship: output dimensions are the inverse of the input dimensions
- detail: each row of the input becomes a column in the output, and vice-versa, consistent with a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
