## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7545B86D25D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7545B86D2CB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colored pixels. The input grid appears to be transformed into a new 3x3 grid, with the same dimensions.  The transformation doesn't involve simple color changes or direct mathematical operations on the individual numbers. It seems to be a spatial rearrangement. The positions of the digits/colors seem to swap, rotate, or reflect, but there's not enough information to determine exactly how. The colors (represented by the digits) are consistent - only the positions change

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_pixels
  - observation: input_grid
    state: initial
  - observation: output_grid
    state: transformed
  - relationship: spatial_transformation
    between: [input_grid, output_grid]
  - constraint: grid_dimensions_preserved
  - constraint: colors (digits) are constants - only locations change
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the input grid, noting the color and position of each pixel.
2.  **Rotate** the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. This can be achieved by swapping the positions of pixels.
3. The top left element of the input will be the top right of the output.

Here I am using the colors and locations to show the mapping.
White(0,0)->White(0,2)
Green(0,1)->Orange(1,2)
Azure(0,2)->Azure(2,0)
Green(1,0)->White(1,0)
Orange(1,1)->Orange(1,1)
White(1,2)->Green(1,2)
Gray(2,0)->Gray(0,2)
White(2,1)->Green(2,1)
White(2,2)->Green(2,2)

4. **Output**: the rotated colors (digits) in the new rotated grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
