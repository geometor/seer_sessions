            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the concept of finding \"surrounded\" green pixels and changing them to yellow. The definition of \"surrounded\" was interpreted as being part of a 2x2 green block. However, the test results across multiple examples reveal that this interpretation is too simplistic and doesn't fully capture the rule. The code fails to identify all the correct pixels to transform, particularly in cases where 2x2 blocks overlap or are adjacent.\n\nThe core issue is the `is_part_of_2x2` function. It looks for *exactly* a 2x2 block. The updated strategy needs to be more flexible and identify connected regions of green pixels, then, within those regions, identify and transform the 'internal' pixels. The notion of \"internal\" needs to be more carefully defined, taking neighbors into account.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of observations from the examples, focusing on where the code fails:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code fails to transform two green pixels that are part of 2x2 blocks. This suggests the `is_part_of_2x2` is failing.\n*   **Example 2:** Only one pixel incorrect. This one is subtle - there's a single pixel that is missed - likely a boundary/edge case related issue.\n*   **Example 3:** Nine pixels off. This example shows multiple adjacent and overlapping 2x2 blocks. This highlights the need for connected component analysis.\n*   **Example 4:** Six pixels are incorrect. Again, overlapping/adjacent regions are not handled well.\n*   **Example 5:** A large number of pixels are missed (31). This example features extensive, complex connected regions of green.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Contains pixels of different colors.\n  - name: pixel\n    type: cell\n    properties:\n      color:\n        type: integer\n        values: [0, 3, 4]  # white, green, yellow\n      position:\n        type: tuple\n        description: (row, column) coordinates\n\n  - name: green_region\n    type: connected_component\n    description: A set of adjacent green pixels.\n    properties:\n      pixels:\n        type: list\n        description: List of pixel positions belonging to the region.\n      internal_pixels:\n        type: list\n        description: >\n          List of pixel positions within the region that are\n          considered \"internal\".\n\nactions:\n  - name: identify_green_regions\n    description: Find all connected regions of green pixels.\n  - name: determine_internal_pixels\n    description: >\n      For each green region, identify pixels that are surrounded\n      by other green pixels on all four sides (up, down, left, right).\n      Diagonals *are* considered.\n  - name: transform_pixels\n    description: Change the color of internal green pixels to yellow.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Connected Green Regions:** Find all connected components (regions) of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Adjacency includes diagonals.\n\n2.  **Define and Find Internal Pixels:** For *each* connected green region:\n    *   A green pixel is considered \"internal\" if *all* of its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) are also green.\n\n3.  **Transform:** Change the color of all identified \"internal\" green pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (white and any green pixels that are *not* identified as \"internal\") retain their original color values.\n\n5.  **Output:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with the color changes applied according to steps 2 and 3.\n"
