Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Green Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels. These regions constitute the "green shapes."

2.  **Define Interior:** Within each green shape, define "interior" pixels as those green pixels that are completely surrounded by either other green pixels or yellow pixels that have already been filled. Consider that at the start all other green cells count as surrounding.

3.  **Iterative Interior Filling:** Iteratively fill the interior of each green shape with yellow (4). Start from the green pixels that do not have white neighbours and are fully surround by green. This process should be repeated until no more green pixels within a shape meet the "interior" criteria.

4.  **Preserve Background:**  All pixels that are not part of a green shape's interior should remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
