Combine these into a single green shape, regardless of whether they are initially contiguous.\n\n2.  **Identify the True Perimeter:** Iterate through all pixels *within the green shape*. A pixel is part of the perimeter if it meets *either* of these conditions:\n    *   It is on the edge of the entire grid (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).\n    *   It has at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, or right \u2013 *not* diagonal) that is *not* part of the *green shape*.\n\n3.  **Identify Interior Pixels:** Iterate through all pixels of the *green shape*. A pixel is considered \"interior\" if and *only if* all four of its direct neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are *also* part of the *green shape*.\n\n4.  **Modify Interior Pixels:** Change the color of all identified interior pixels to yellow (4).\n\n5. **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels (those not part of the original green shape) in the grid retain their original colors. The output grid must be the same size as the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_green_shape(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all green pixels and returns their coordinates as a set.\n    \"\"\"\n    green_shape = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == 3:\n                green_shape.add((r, c))\n    return green_shape\n\ndef find_true_perimeter(green_shape, rows, cols):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the true perimeter pixels of the green shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    perimeter = set()\n    for r, c in green_shape:\n        # Check if it's on the edge of the grid\n        if r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1:\n            perimeter.add((r, c))\n            continue\n\n        # Check direct neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n        is_perimeter = False\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if not (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols) or (nr, nc) not in green_shape:\n                is_perimeter = True\n                break\n        if is_perimeter:\n            perimeter.add((r, c))\n    return perimeter\n\ndef find_interior_pixels(green_shape, rows, cols):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the interior pixels of the green shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    interior = set()\n    for r, c in green_shape:\n        # Check all four direct neighbors\n        neighbors = [(r - 1, c), (r + 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c + 1)]\n        is_interior = True\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if not (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols) or (nr, nc) not in green_shape:\n                is_interior = False\n                break\n        if is_interior:\n            interior.add((r, c))\n    return interior\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Identify the Green Shape (all green pixels)\n    green_shape = find_green_shape(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the true perimeter of combined shape\n    # perimeter = find_true_perimeter(green_shape, rows, cols) # Removed, not directly used\n\n    # Identify Interior Pixels\n    interior_pixels = find_interior_pixels(green_shape, rows, cols)\n\n    # Modify Interior Pixels\n    for r, c in interior_pixels:\n        output_grid[r, c] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
