Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels within the input grid. Combine these into a single green shape.
2.  **Identify the True Perimeter:** Iterate through all pixels within the green shape. A pixel is part of the perimeter if it meets *either* of these conditions:
    *   It is on the edge of the entire grid (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).
    *   It has at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, or right – *not* diagonal) that is *not* part of the green shape.
3.  **Modify Interior Pixels:** Iterate through all pixels of the green shape. If a pixel is *not* in the perimeter set, change its color to yellow (4).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels in the grid retain their original colors. The output grid must be the same size as the input grid. The final output grid represents the modified input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
