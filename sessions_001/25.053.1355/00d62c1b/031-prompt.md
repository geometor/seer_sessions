Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Connected Green Regions: Find all connected components (regions) of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Adjacency includes diagonals.

2. Define and Find Internal Pixels: For *each* connected green region:
    *   A green pixel is considered "internal" if *all* of its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) are also green.

3. Transform: Change the color of all identified "internal" green pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).

4. Preserve Other Pixels: All other pixels (white and any green pixels that are *not* identified as "internal") retain their original color values.

5. Output: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with the color changes applied according to steps 2 and 3.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
