"""
1.  **Identify Green Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels. These regions constitute the "green shapes."

2.  **Define Interior:** Within each green shape, define "interior" pixels as those green pixels that are completely surrounded by either other green pixels or yellow pixels that have already been filled. Consider that at the start all other green cells count as surrounding.

3.  **Iterative Interior Filling:** Iteratively fill the interior of each green shape with yellow (4). Start from the green pixels that do not have white neighbours and are fully surround by green. This process should be repeated until no more green pixels within a shape meet the "interior" criteria.

4.  **Preserve Background:**  All pixels that are not part of a green shape's interior should remain unchanged.

Okay, here's an assessment of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code focused on filling the "interior" of green shapes with yellow. The definition of "interior" was based on a green pixel being surrounded by other green or yellow pixels. However, the results across the training examples show that this definition is too simplistic and doesn't capture the true rule. The code is failing to fill some pixels that should be filled, and in some cases, is filling when it shouldn't. The core issue is that the "interior" concept needs to be redefined in a manner that accounts for connectivity to the "edge".

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine "Interior" Definition:** Instead of just checking immediate neighbors, we need to consider a green pixel as "interior" if it's part of a contiguous green region *and* it cannot be reached from the edge of the grid by only traversing green pixels. The edge should act as the "boundary".

2.  **Iterative Filling:** The current iterative approach is conceptually correct, but we will start the yellow fill from a seed pixel, and grow outwards.

3.  **Consider White:** Consider the edges of the white background/frame as being a boundary.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

We are provided with the results - here is a summary:

*   **Example 1:** 2 pixels missed. The two central '4' (yellow) pixels are missing.
*   **Example 2:** 1 pixel missed. The central '4' in the lower right group is missing.
*   **Example 3:** 9 pixels missed. A large chunk of '4's on the interior is missing.
*   **Example 4:** 6 pixels missed, several '4's on the interior are missing.
*   **Example 5:** 31 pixels missed. Large contiguous areas of green that should be filled are not.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: 036
objects:
  - id: green_shapes
    color: green
    description: Contiguous regions of green pixels.
    behavior: Their "interior" is filled with yellow.
  - id: background
    color: white
    description: The background pixels.
    behavior: Remains unchanged.

actions:
  - name: fill_interior
    target: green_shapes
    with_color: yellow
    condition: "A green pixel is part of the interior if it's connected to other green pixels and can't be reached from the edge of the grid (or a white/0 pixel) by traversing only through green pixels."
    iteration: "The filling process is iterative, expanding outwards from the seed green cells."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Shapes:** Find all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels. These are the "green shapes."

2.  **Identify Starting "Seeds":** The first "seed" will be pixels that are only surrounded by green pixels.

3.  **Iterative Interior Filling:**
    *   Seed Growth: Starting with the seed, expand outwards, filling adjacent green pixels. Consider the 'white' background to be a boundary.

4.  **Preserve Background:** All pixels that are not part of a green shape's interior remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
