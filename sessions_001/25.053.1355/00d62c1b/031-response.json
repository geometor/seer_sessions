            "text": "Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core issue is that the code correctly identifies *some* internal pixels but misses others. The initial natural language program and the resulting code are too simplistic. The definition of \"internal\" needs refinement. The code checks if *all* neighbors are green, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for all cases.  We need to consider cases where green regions are adjacent, sharing boundaries. The current logic doesn't correctly handle pixels along shared borders between distinct green regions.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze the failing examples:** Carefully examine *why* specific pixels were missed or incorrectly included.\n2.  **Refine \"internal\" definition:** Develop a more precise rule for identifying truly internal pixels, likely involving checks for connected components.\n3.  **Update the natural language program:** Reflect the refined definition.\n4.  **Update and test the code:** Modify the code to match the improved logic, then test on all examples.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting the specific errors:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The two center green pixels that *should* have turned yellow were missed. These pixels are part of a single connected green region.\n*   **Example 2:** The green pixel at (4, 6) should have turned yellow but didn't. This pixel is part of a large connected component (diagonally connected).\n*   **Example 3:** Many internal green pixels were not converted. Several connected green areas are present, but not all internal points were changed.\n*   **Example 4:**  Similar to example 3, internal green pixels in the larger regions are missed.\n*   **Example 5:** Most internal pixels are not changed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 030\nexamples:\n  - input_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8 # Includes diagonals\n        internal_pixels: [] # To be filled in after analysis\n    output_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: [] # To be filled, should match input after transformation\n    transformations:\n      - action: change_color\n        from_color: green\n        to_color: yellow\n        target: internal_pixels\n  - input_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: []\n    output_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: []\n    transformations:\n      - action: change_color\n        from_color: green\n        to_color: yellow\n        target: internal_pixels\n  - input_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: []\n    output_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: []\n    transformations:\n      - action: change_color\n        from_color: green\n        to_color: yellow\n        target: internal_pixels\n  - input_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: []\n    output_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: []\n    transformations:\n      - action: change_color\n        from_color: green\n        to_color: yellow\n        target: internal_pixels\n  - input_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: []\n    output_objects:\n      - type: connected_region\n        color: green\n        connectivity: 8\n        internal_pixels: []\n    transformations:\n      - action: change_color\n        from_color: green\n        to_color: yellow\n        target: internal_pixels\ngeneral_rule: \"Change the color of internal green pixels to yellow.\"\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Connected Green Regions:** Find all connected components (regions) of green (3) pixels in the input grid. Adjacency includes diagonals (8-connectivity).\n\n2.  **Define Internal Pixels:** For *each* connected green region:\n    *   A green pixel is considered \"internal\" if *all* of its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) are also green, *and* it belongs to the same connected component.\n\n3.  **Transform:** Change the color of all identified \"internal\" green pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (white and any green pixels that are *not* identified as \"internal\") retain their original color values.\n\n5.  **Output:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with the color changes applied according to steps 2 and 3.\n"
