Adjacency includes diagonals (8-connectivity).\n\n2. Define Internal Pixels: For *each* connected green region:\n    *   A green pixel is considered \"internal\" if *all* of its eight neighbors (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) are also green, *and* it belongs to the same connected component.\n\n3. Transform: Change the color of all identified \"internal\" green pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).\n\n4. Preserve Other Pixels: All other pixels (white and any green pixels that are *not* identified as \"internal\") retain their original color values.\n\n5. Output: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with the color changes applied according to steps 2 and 3.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label, generate_binary_structure\n\ndef get_all_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of all neighbors (including diagonals) of a given cell.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    \n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue  # Skip the cell itself\n            r, c = row + dr, col + dc\n            if 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols:\n                neighbors.append((r, c))\n                \n    return neighbors\n\ndef find_internal_pixels(grid, labeled_grid, region_label):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies internal pixels within a specific labeled region.
