"""
The input is a grid of pixels. Each pixel has a color value of 0 (white) or 3 (green).
Identify green (3) pixels that are part of a 2x2 block of green (3) pixels which share at least one side and/or at least one corner.
Change the color value of the identified "internal" or "surrounded" green (3) pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).
Ensure all other pixels, those colored white, and those green pixels not part of an identified "internal" block retain their original values.
The output is a grid with the same dimensions as the input, but with the specified color changes applied.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
