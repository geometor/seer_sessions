            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies contiguous blocks of green pixels and attempts to find an \"interior\" pixel to change to yellow. However, the definition of \"interior\" is too strict. The current `is_surrounded` function requires a pixel to be surrounded by green pixels on all eight sides (including diagonals). This works for some cases but fails in others where the green shape has irregularities or is adjacent to the grid boundary. The updated strategy is to change the definition of a pixel that is not on the edge.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on relevant observations for updating the rule:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code fails because the central `3` is only considered interior by its strict definition, it needs to see adjacent to any other color or boundary.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, an eligible pixel is missed.\n*   **Example 3:** Many pixels are missed. The new definition will greatly improve.\n*   **Example 4:** Many pixels are missed. The new definition will greatly improve.\n*   **Example 5:** Many pixels missed, more complex shape. This highlights the need for a rule that considers all non-edge pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 010\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    objects:\n      - type: shape\n        color: green\n        property: contiguous\n        interior_pixels:\n            definition: A green pixel that is not on the perimeter of the shape.\n            action: change color to yellow\n      - type: grid_background\n        color: black\n\n  - id: 2\n    objects:\n      - type: shape\n        color: green\n        property: contiguous\n        interior_pixels:\n            definition:  A green pixel that is not on the perimeter of the shape.\n            action: change color to yellow\n      - type: grid_background\n        color: black\n\n  - id: 3\n    objects:\n      - type: shape\n        color: green\n        property: contiguous\n        interior_pixels:\n          definition:  A green pixel that is not on the perimeter of the shape.\n          action: change color to yellow\n      - type: grid_background\n        color: black\n  - id: 4\n      objects:\n        - type: shape\n          color: green\n          property: contiguous\n          interior_pixels:\n              definition:  A green pixel that is not on the perimeter of the shape.\n              action: change color to yellow\n        - type: grid_background\n          color: black\n  - id: 5\n      objects:\n        - type: shape\n          color: green\n          property: contiguous\n          interior_pixels:\n              definition:  A green pixel that is not on the perimeter of the shape.\n              action: change color to yellow\n        - type: grid_background\n            color: black\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels within the input grid. Consider this the green shape.\n2.  **Identify perimeter:** find the set of pixels that are on the perimeter of the shape\n3. **Modify Interior Pixels:** Iterate through all green pixels, if they are not in the shape perimeter, change the pixel to yellow.\n4.  **Preserve Remainder:** The output grid is the same size as the input grid. Copy the data from the input grid, modifying the green to yellow as identified.\n"
