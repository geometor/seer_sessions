Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels within the input grid. Combine these into a single green shape.
2.  **Identify the True Perimeter:** Iterate through all pixels within the green shape. A pixel is part of the perimeter if it meets *either* of these conditions:
    *   It is on the edge of the entire grid (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).
    *   It has at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, or right – *not* diagonal) that is *not* part of the green shape.
3.  **Modify Interior Pixels:** Iterate through all pixels of the green shape. If a pixel is *not* in the perimeter set, change its color to yellow (4).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels in the grid retain their original colors. The output grid must be the same size as the input grid. The final output grid represents the modified input.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identifies contiguous green blocks and attempts to find the perimeter. However, it consistently fails to correctly identify *all* the interior pixels that should be turned yellow. The primary issue seems to be in how the "interior" is determined. The code identifies green shape pixels that are not on the perimeter, however it's implementation is not consistent with expected results across the training samples. A review of each case will be helpful to determine a strategy for revising the natural language program.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including some additional analysis using code to verify assumptions:

*   **Example 1:** The transformed output missed changing two `0`s to `4`s.
    *   Mismatch coordinates: `[(2, 2), (3, 3)]`
    *   Expected Values: `[4, 4]`
    *   Transformed values: `[0, 0]`

*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, two `0`s were not changed to `4`s.
    *   Mismatch coordinates: `[(4, 6), (6, 3)]`
    *   Expected Values:  `[4, 4]`
    *   Transformed values: `[0, 4]`
        *   note that in this case, one of the two mismatched pixels was partially
            correct - (6, 3) was identified as a green shape, but it was not
            changed in the output grid

*   **Example 3:**  Nine pixels were not changed.
    *   Mismatch coordinates: `[(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 5)]`
    *   Expected Values: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`
    *   Transformed values: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

*   **Example 4:** Six Pixels were not changed.
    *    Mismatch coordinates: `[(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (7, 8), (8, 4)]`
    *    Expected Values:  `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`
    *   Transformed values: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]`

*   **Example 5:**  31 pixels were not changed, many of them in large contiguous
    blocks
    *   Expected Values:  all values are `4`
    *   Transformed values: all values are `0`

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_shape
    color: green
    description: The union of all contiguous green pixels.
  - name: perimeter_pixels
    color: green
    description:  Pixels of the green_shape on the edge or adjacent to a non-green_shape pixel.
  - name: interior_pixels
    color: yellow
    description: Pixels of the green_shape NOT in perimeter_pixels

actions:
  - name: identify_green_shape
    description: Find all green pixels and combine them.
  - name: find_perimeter
    description: Determine the perimeter of the green_shape.
  - name: modify_interior
    description: Change the color of interior_pixels to yellow.
  - name: preserve_other_colors
    description: keep all non-green_shape pixels the same color
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the input grid.  Combine these into a single green shape, regardless of whether they are initially contiguous.

2.  **Identify the True Perimeter:** Iterate through all pixels *within the green shape*. A pixel is part of the perimeter if it meets *either* of these conditions:
    *   It is on the edge of the entire grid (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).
    *   It has at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, or right – *not* diagonal) that is *not* part of the *green shape*.

3.  **Identify Interior Pixels:** Iterate through all pixels of the *green shape*. A pixel is considered "interior" if and *only if* all four of its direct neighbors (up, down, left, and right) are *also* part of the *green shape*.

4.  **Modify Interior Pixels:** Change the color of all identified interior pixels to yellow (4).

5. **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels (those not part of the original green shape) in the grid retain their original colors. The output grid must be the same size as the input grid.

Key Changes and Rationale:

*   **Combined Green Shape:** Explicitly stating that *all* green pixels form a single shape, even if disconnected, clarifies the object definition.
*  **Interior definition:** A much stricter definition of interior is implemented. This seems consistent with the expected results of the train examples.
*   **"Only If"**: Added for emphasis on strict interior definition.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
