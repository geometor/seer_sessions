1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels within the input grid. Consider this the green shape.
2.  **Identify perimeter:** find the set of pixels that are on the perimeter of the shape
3. **Modify Interior Pixels:** Iterate through all green pixels, if they are not in the shape perimeter, change the pixel to yellow.
4.  **Preserve Remainder:** The output grid is the same size as the input grid. Copy the data from the input grid, modifying the green to yellow as identified.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
