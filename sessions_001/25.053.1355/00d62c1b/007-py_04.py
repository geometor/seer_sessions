"""
1. Identify Green Regions: Find all contiguous regions of green (value 3) pixels in the input grid. A contiguous region is a group of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right â€“ not diagonally) to at least one other pixel in the group.
2. Determine Enclosure: For each identified green region, determine if it is "enclosed." A region is considered enclosed if *none* of its pixels are on the edge of the grid.
3. Transform Enclosed Pixels: Change the color of all pixels within the enclosed green regions from green (3) to yellow (4).
