Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The primary colors observed are white (0) and green (3). There's a transformation occurring where some green (3) pixels are changed to yellow (4) pixels. The transformation seems localized and specific, affecting only certain green pixels. The shapes, sizes, and overall layout of the white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      cell_values: [0, 3, 4]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        white: 0
        green: 3
        yellow: 4
      position: [row, column]

actions:
  - type: color_change
    properties:
      from_color: 3
      to_color: 4
      conditions:
        - adjacency: "adjacent to other 3's"
    constraints: #need more examples to be sure what is the actual constraint to cause a color change.
        - "color change is limited to small interior blocks, not all adjacent pixels."
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Pixels sharing a side or corner"
  - type: containment
    description: "The grid contains pixels."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input is a 10x10 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a color value of 0 (white) or 3 (green).

2.  **Locate Target Pixels:** Identify green (3) pixels that are part of a 2x2 block of green (3) pixels which share at least one side and/or at least one corner.

3.  **Transform Pixels:** Change the color value of the identified "internal" or "surrounded" green (3) pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).

4. **Preserve Other Pixels**: Ensure all other pixels, those colored white, and those green pixels not part of an identified "internal" block retain their original values.

5.  **Output:** The output is a 10x10 grid with the same dimensions as the input, but with the specified color changes applied.
