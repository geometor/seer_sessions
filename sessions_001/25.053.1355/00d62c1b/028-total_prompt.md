Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input is a 10x10 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a color value of 0 (white) or 3 (green).
Identify green (3) pixels that are part of a 2x2 block of green (3) pixels which share at least one side and/or at least one corner.
Change the color value of the identified "internal" or "surrounded" green (3) pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).
Ensure all other pixels, those colored white, and those green pixels not part of an identified "internal" block retain their original values.
The output is a 10x10 grid with the same dimensions as the input, but with the specified color changes applied.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a reasonable premise: identifying green (3) pixels surrounded by other green pixels and changing them to yellow (4). However, the definition of "surrounded" was too simplistic, only considering direct neighbors (4-connectivity). The test results clearly show that a more robust definition of "surrounded" and "2x2 block", including diagonal adjacency, is needed to match the expected outputs. The current code has low accuracy in examples 2,3, 4, 5 where many pixels differ. Example 1 has only two pixels, where previous program fails, which helps in debugging, by looking a minimal change to debug.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Improve Neighbor Definition:** Update the `get_neighbors` function, or add a new function to include diagonally adjacent cells.
2.  **Refine 2x2 Block Detection:** Re-implement the logic that checks for 2x2 blocks of green. It should consider at least one green neighbor and check those neighbor's neighbors.
3. **Simplify:** Reduce complexity of the loop to check for neighbors and neighbors of neighbors.

**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid. This ensures that any unchanged pixels retain their original values.

2.  **Iteration:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.

3.  **Green Pixel Check:** If the current pixel is not green (value 3), proceed to the next pixel.

4. **Find Neighbors:** Get a list of all neighbors of a green pixel, including all eight adjacent cells (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest).

5.  **2x2 Block Detection:** If the current green pixel is part of a 2x2 block of green pixels. If, and only if, current green pixel (row,col) and neighbors (r1,c1), (r2,c2) and (r3,c3) builds a block:

```
   (row,col)  (r1,c1)
   (r2,c2)   (r3,c3)
```
6.  **Color Change:** If a green pixel is determined to be part of at least one 2x2 block of green pixels (with at least one shared side or at least one shared corner), change its color in the *output* grid from green (3) to yellow (4).

7.  **Output:** Return the modified output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
