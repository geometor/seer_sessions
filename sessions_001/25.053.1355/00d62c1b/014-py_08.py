"""
1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels within the input grid. Combine these into a single green shape.
2.  **Identify the True Perimeter:** Iterate through all pixels within the green shape. A pixel is part of the perimeter if it meets *either* of these conditions:
    *   It is on the edge of the entire grid (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).
    *   It has at least one direct neighbor (up, down, left, or right â€“ *not* diagonal) that is *not* part of the green shape.
3.  **Modify Interior Pixels:** Iterate through all pixels of the green shape. If a pixel is *not* in the perimeter set, change its color to yellow (4).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels in the grid retain their original colors. The output grid must be the same size as the input grid. The final output grid represents the modified input.
