            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the tests and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying green regions and filling based on adjacency to white pixels is partially correct. However, it's misinterpreting the filling rule. It's not just about being *adjacent* to white, but about filling the *interior* of the green shapes. The current code fills *any* green pixel adjacent to white with yellow, which leads to incorrect \"outlining\" instead of interior filling. The core issue is the definition of \"interior\". The adjacency check needs to be more sophisticated.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Redefine \"Interior\":** Instead of simply checking for adjacency to white, we need to determine if a green pixel is part of the \"interior\" of a green shape. A good way to think about this is if a green pixel is completely surrounded by other green pixels *or* filled yellow pixels.\n\n2.  **Iterative Filling:** Because filling one pixel can change the \"interior\" status of another, the filling process likely needs to be iterative. We might need to repeatedly scan the green region until no more pixels can be filled.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Combined from provided data):**\n\n| Example | Input Size      | Output Size     | Match | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | 6x6             | 6x6             | False | 8          | Simple shape, demonstrates outlining error. Incorrectly fills all perimeter green cells.                                                                  |\n| 2       | 10x10           | 10x10           | False | 16         | More complex shape, further confirms outlining error.                                                                                                     |\n| 3       | 10x10           | 10x10           | False | 31         | Mixed shapes, highlights the issue with multiple disconnected green regions and more complex adjacencies.                                                     |\n| 4       | 10x10           | 10x10           | False | 35         | Another complex shape, reinforcing the need for a better interior definition.                                                                                  |\n| 5       | 20x20          | 20x20         | False  |     98       | large complex case.                                                                                                           |\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: green_shape\n    color: 3\n    description: A contiguous region of green pixels.\n    properties:\n      - interior: pixels surrounded by other green or yellow pixels.\n      - filled: boolean, initially false, becomes true when filled with yellow.\n\nactions:\n  - name: fill_interior\n    target: green_shape\n    condition: green pixels surrounded by other greens or already filled areas.\n    operation: Change the color of interior green pixels to yellow (4).\n    iteration:  The filling process is iterative and may need multiple passes.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels. These regions constitute the \"green shapes.\"\n\n2.  **Define Interior:** Within each green shape, define \"interior\" pixels as those green pixels that are completely surrounded by either other green pixels or yellow pixels that have already been filled. Consider that at the start all other green cells count as surrounding.\n\n3.  **Iterative Interior Filling:** Iteratively fill the interior of each green shape with yellow (4). Start from the green pixels that do not have white neighbours and are fully surround by green. This process should be repeated until no more green pixels within a shape meet the \"interior\" criteria.\n\n4.  **Preserve Background:**  All pixels that are not part of a green shape's interior should remain unchanged.\n\nThe key improvement here is the iterative filling and the more precise definition of \"interior\" pixels. The iterative approach is crucial because the act of filling changes which pixels are considered \"interior\".\n"
