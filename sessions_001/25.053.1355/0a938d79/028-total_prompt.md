1.  **Identify Key Rows:** In the input grid, locate the rows containing the non-zero colored pixels. In this case, find the row with the yellow pixel (4) and the row with the blue pixel (1).
2.  **Expand:** Expand the non zero values across the entire row.
3.  **Replicate and Position:**
    *   Copy the expanded yellow row and repeat the expanded row every 8 rows, starting at its original row index.
    *   Copy the expanded blue row and repeat it every 8 rows starting with the original row.
4.  **Fill Remaining Rows:** All other rows in the output grid remain unchanged from the input (filled with 0s).

Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop an updated natural language program and supporting information.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code have significant flaws. The core idea of identifying non-zero rows and expanding them is partially correct, but the replication logic (every 8 rows) is incorrect and doesn't generalize across the examples. The code also fails to correctly handle multiple colored rows within the same input, and doesn't correctly predict the output pattern. It's clear the "every 8 rows" was taken directly from input of the first example and is not a correct hypothesis. The code *does* correctly initialize the output as a copy of the input.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct the replication logic:** The replication is not fixed at 8 rows. It appears the colored rows are expanded *and* then a pattern using the expanded rows is generated. We need to discern that pattern using the examples.
2.  **Handle multiple colored rows:** The current logic correctly extracts *all* the rows, this part can be preserved.
3.  **Refine Expansion** Focus on the expansion. It doesn't seem to handle interspersed 0s.
4. **Consider Output Size** Output and input are not always the same size.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

Let's examine each example closely to see how it has been processed:

*   **Example 1:** The initial program's logic of repeating every 8 is clearly wrong as the output repeats the pattern of the input across the whole grid.
*   **Example 2:** There are two colors, and the output is a combination of expanded rows, repeated.
*   **Example 3:** Similar to the previous examples, expand and interweave.
*   **Example 4:** Expands the rows and repeats, producing a repeating sequence of the expanded rows.

**YAML Fact Extraction:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: 026d50a2
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 2 # Red
          row: 0
          original_positions: [[0, 5]]
        - color: 8 # Azure
          row: 9
          original_positions: [[9, 7]]
      output_objects:
        - pattern: "alternating 2 and 8, starting at column 5"
          description: "The output is rows of alternating colors 2 and 8, starting at the column of the initial 2"

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 1  # Blue
          row: 0
          original_positions: [[0,5]]
        - color: 3 # Green
          row: 6
          original_positions: [[6,8]]
      output_objects:
        - pattern: "alternating 1 and 3"
          description: "The output rows alternate between blue (1) and green (3), starting with the first row of the input (blue)."
  - example_3:
    input_objects:
      - color: 2 # Red
        row: 5
        original_positions: [[5,0]]
      - color: 3  # Green
        row: 7
        original_positions: [[7,8]]
    output_objects:
      - pattern: "alternating 2 and 3, with blank rows"
        description: "2 and 3 alternate, offset by 2"

  - example_4:
      input_objects:
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        row: 7
        original_positions: [[7,0]]
      - color: 1 # Blue
        row: 11
        original_positions: [[11,0]]
      output_objects:
        - pattern: "alternating blocks of 4 and 1"
        description: "Blocks of 4 and 1, offset by 4."
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Rows:** Find all rows in the input grid that contain non-zero pixels. Note the color and the row index of each.
2.  **Expand Rows:** For each colored row found, create a new row where every cell containing 0 is set to the color of the original row.
3.  **Create Repeating Pattern:** The expanded rows form a repeating pattern in the output. The pattern appears as alternating rows of the expanded color.
4. **Output Size**: Output size is input size.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
