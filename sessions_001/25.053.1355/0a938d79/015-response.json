            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy was on the right track by identifying non-zero pixels, extracting unique colors, and attempting to replicate a pattern. However, it's clear that the replication logic is flawed. The code incorrectly assumes that the pattern should always be replicated across the entire grid, filling every row or column with a single color from the pattern, based on a simple modulus operation. The examples show a more complex \"alternating\" or \"interleaving\" replication of the detected color pattern, and it is based on the location of the colors.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct the Replication Logic:** Instead of simply filling entire rows or columns, the replication needs to *extend* the existing pattern of non-zero pixels. The key is correctly identifying and extending the original pattern discovered in the input.\n\n2.  **Address Alternation:** The examples demonstrate that the pattern can alternate, meaning that in example 2, blue is before green in the first use of the pattern, and in the subsequent use, the pattern is extended in the same direction, so the output grid should not just extend the single instance of the input pattern, but continue to alternate colors to extend the pattern.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including calculated metrics:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Unique Input Colors | Unique Output Colors | Axis | Pixels Off | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- | ---- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (10, 25)    | (10, 25)     | \\[2, 8]            | \\[2, 8]             | col  | 200         | The code incorrectly replicates colors 2 and 8 vertically. It should replicate them horizontally, extending the existing color pattern.                                                                                                                                                 |\n| 2       | (7, 23)     | (7, 23)      | \\[1, 3]            | \\[1, 3]             | col  | 140         | Similar to example 1, the replication is vertical instead of horizontal, based on extending pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 3       | (22, 9)     | (22, 9)      | \\[2, 3]            | \\[2, 3]             | row  | 162         | The code starts replication from the first row, ignoring the original positions of 2 and 3. The replication is not extending a pattern, but creating a new one that ignores the pattern.                                                                                              |\n| 4       | (24, 8)     | (24, 8)      | \\[4, 1]            | \\[4, 1]             | row  | 168          | Again, vertical replication instead of horizontal. It seems the existing pattern has been ignored in favor of simply repeating rows of a single color. Replication begins on the wrong rows, and alternation pattern isn't considered.                                                     |\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input_objects:\n    - color: 2\n      positions: [(0, 5)]\n    - color: 8\n      positions: [(9, 7)]\n  output_objects:\n    - color: 2\n      positions: extended horizontally from (0,5)\n    - color: 8\n      positions: extended horizontally from (9,7)\n  transformation: \"Horizontal extension of color pattern 2,8.\"\n  axis: \"column\"\n\nexample_2:\n  input_objects:\n    - color: 1\n      positions: [(0, 5)]\n    - color: 3\n      positions: [(6, 8)]\n  output_objects:\n    - color: 1\n      positions: extended horizontally from (0,5)\n    - color: 3\n      positions: extended horizontally from (6,8)\n  transformation: \"Horizontal extension of color pattern 1,3.\"\n  axis: \"column\"\n\nexample_3:\n  input_objects:\n    - color: 2\n      positions: [(5, 0)]\n    - color: 3\n      positions: [(7, 8)]\n  output_objects:\n      - color: 2\n        positions: extended vertically from (5,0)\n      - color: 3\n        positions: extended vertically from (7,8)\n  transformation: \"Vertical extension of the pattern 2 and 3\"\n  axis: \"row\"\n\nexample_4:\n  input_objects:\n    - color: 4\n      positions: [(7, 0)]\n    - color: 1\n      positions: [(11, 0)]\n  output_objects:\n    - color: 4\n          positions: extended vertically from (7,0)\n    - color: 1\n          positions: extended vertically from (11,0)\n  transformation: \"Vertical extention of the pattern 4 and 1\"\n  axis: \"row\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all the non-zero pixels in the input grid. Each of these is considered an \"object\". Note their color and initial position.\n\n2. **Determine the Axis of Extension**:\n    * If all objects are in one row, then the axis of extension is `column`.\n    * If all objects are in one column, then the axis of extension is `row`.\n    * Otherwise, the axis depends on a pattern, if row, the axis is `row`, if column, the axis is `column`\n\n3.  **Identify the Color Pattern**:\n    *   Create an ordered list of the unique colors, this establishes the replication pattern.\n    *   If the objects span multiple rows and/or columns, consider their initial relative positions to maintain the pattern during extension.\n\n4.  **Extend the Pattern:**\n    *   **Horizontal Extension (Column Axis):** For each object, extend its color horizontally along its row, creating copies to the left and right, maintaining the original pattern spacing and order with other colors. The pattern is continued to the edge of the grid.\n    *   **Vertical Extension (Row Axis):** For each object, extend its color vertically along its column, creating copies above and below, maintaining the original pattern spacing and order with other colors. The pattern is continued to the edge of the grid.\n\n5. **Maintain Relative Positions**: When extending, if objects had initial relative positions (e.g., color A was two columns to the left of color B), ensure this relative positioning is maintained during the extension.\n"
