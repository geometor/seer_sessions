1.  **Identify Key Rows:** In the input grid, locate the rows containing the non-zero colored pixels. In this case, find the row with the yellow pixel (4) and the row with the blue pixel (1).
2.  **Expand:** Expand the non zero values across the entire row.
3.  **Replicate and Position:**
    *   Copy the expanded yellow row and repeat the expanded row every 8 rows, starting at its original row index.
    *   Copy the expanded blue row and repeat it every 8 rows starting with the original row.
4.  **Fill Remaining Rows:** All other rows in the output grid remain unchanged from the input (filled with 0s).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
