            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop an updated natural language program and supporting information.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code have significant flaws. The core idea of identifying non-zero rows and expanding them is partially correct, but the replication logic (every 8 rows) is incorrect and doesn't generalize across the examples. The code also fails to correctly handle multiple colored rows within the same input, and doesn't correctly predict the output pattern. It's clear the \"every 8 rows\" was taken directly from input of the first example and is not a correct hypothesis. The code *does* correctly initialize the output as a copy of the input.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct the replication logic:** The replication is not fixed at 8 rows. It appears the colored rows are expanded *and* then a pattern using the expanded rows is generated. We need to discern that pattern using the examples.\n2.  **Handle multiple colored rows:** The current logic correctly extracts *all* the rows, this part can be preserved.\n3.  **Refine Expansion** Focus on the expansion. It doesn't seem to handle interspersed 0s.\n4. **Consider Output Size** Output and input are not always the same size.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**\n\nLet's examine each example closely to see how it has been processed:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The initial program's logic of repeating every 8 is clearly wrong as the output repeats the pattern of the input across the whole grid.\n*   **Example 2:** There are two colors, and the output is a combination of expanded rows, repeated.\n*   **Example 3:** Similar to the previous examples, expand and interweave.\n*   **Example 4:** Expands the rows and repeats, producing a repeating sequence of the expanded rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Extraction:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: 026d50a2\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: 2 # Red\n          row: 0\n          original_positions: [[0, 5]]\n        - color: 8 # Azure\n          row: 9\n          original_positions: [[9, 7]]\n      output_objects:\n        - pattern: \"alternating 2 and 8, starting at column 5\"\n          description: \"The output is rows of alternating colors 2 and 8, starting at the column of the initial 2\"\n\n  - example_2:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: 1  # Blue\n          row: 0\n          original_positions: [[0,5]]\n        - color: 3 # Green\n          row: 6\n          original_positions: [[6,8]]\n      output_objects:\n        - pattern: \"alternating 1 and 3\"\n          description: \"The output rows alternate between blue (1) and green (3), starting with the first row of the input (blue).\"\n  - example_3:\n    input_objects:\n      - color: 2 # Red\n        row: 5\n        original_positions: [[5,0]]\n      - color: 3  # Green\n        row: 7\n        original_positions: [[7,8]]\n    output_objects:\n      - pattern: \"alternating 2 and 3, with blank rows\"\n        description: \"2 and 3 alternate, offset by 2\"\n\n  - example_4:\n      input_objects:\n      - color: 4  # Yellow\n        row: 7\n        original_positions: [[7,0]]\n      - color: 1 # Blue\n        row: 11\n        original_positions: [[11,0]]\n      output_objects:\n        - pattern: \"alternating blocks of 4 and 1\"\n        description: \"Blocks of 4 and 1, offset by 4.\"\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Colored Rows:** Find all rows in the input grid that contain non-zero pixels. Note the color and the row index of each.\n2.  **Expand Rows:** For each colored row found, create a new row where every cell containing 0 is set to the color of the original row.\n3.  **Create Repeating Pattern:** The expanded rows form a repeating pattern in the output. The pattern appears as alternating rows of the expanded color.\n4. **Output Size**: Output size is input size.\n\n"
