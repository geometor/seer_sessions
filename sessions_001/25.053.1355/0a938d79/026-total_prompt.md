Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids consist of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9), which corresponds to a specific color. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and yellow (4). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with certain rows replicated and expanded. There seems to be a pattern of repeating rows and creating vertical stripes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: The original grid of pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: 24
      - columns: 8
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 4]
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: The transformed grid of pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: 24
      - columns: 8
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 4]
  - name: yellow_row
    type: row
    description: A row in the input grid containing a yellow pixel.
    properties:
      - row_index: 7
      - color: yellow (4)
  - name: blue_row
    type: row
    description: A row in the input grid containing a blue pixel.
    properties:
      - row_index: 11
      - color: blue (1)
  - name: expanded_yellow_row
    type: row_set
    description: Replicated yellow rows in the output grid.
    properties:
      - row_indices: [7, 15, 23]
      - color: yellow (4)
  - name: expanded_blue_row
     type: row_set
     description: Replicated blue rows on the output grid
     properties:
       - row_indices: [11, 19]
       - color: blue(1)

actions:
  - name: replicate_row
    description: Copy a row from the input grid and repeat it multiple times in the output grid.
    parameters:
      - row_index: The index of the row to replicate.
      - repeat_count: The number of times to repeat the row.
  - name: expand_color
    description: expand the non zero pixels across the row

relationships:
  - input_grid is_transformed_to output_grid
  - yellow_row is_part_of input_grid
  - blue_row is_part_of input_grid
  - expanded_yellow_row is_part_of output_grid
  - expanded_blue_row is_part_of output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Rows:** In the input grid, locate the rows containing the non-zero colored pixels. In this case, find the row with the yellow pixel (4) and the row with the blue pixel (1).

2.  **Expand:** Expand the non zero values across the entire row.

3.  **Replicate and Position:**
    *   Copy the expanded yellow row and repeat the expanded row every 8 rows, starting at its original row index.
    *   Copy the expanded blue row and repeat it every 8 rows starting with the original row.

4. **Fill Remaining Rows:** All other rows in the output grid remain unchanged from the input (filled with 0s).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
