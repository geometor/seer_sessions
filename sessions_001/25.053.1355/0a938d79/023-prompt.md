"""
1.  **Identify Seed Rows:** Find all rows in the input grid that contain at least one non-white (non-zero) pixel. These are the "seed rows." Record the color and column index of the first non-white pixel in each seed row, maintaining the order.
2.  **Horizontal Striped Fill:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. Fill each row of the output grid with a single color, creating horizontal stripes.
3.  **Interleave Colors:** Starting from the top row of the output grid, assign colors to the rows based on the order of colors and column indices found in the seed rows. Cycle through the seed row colors repeatedly.  If the seed row colors are red and then blue, the output rows will be filled with red, blue, red, blue, etc.
4.  **Column-Based Placement:**  When filling a row with a given color, place the colored pixel in specific columns. The columns are determined by the column indices of the seed pixels *of that color* in the input grid.  Shift the columns cyclically for each subsequent row of the same color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
