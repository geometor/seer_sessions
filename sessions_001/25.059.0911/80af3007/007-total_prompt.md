Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves subsampling the input grid by a factor of 2. The output grid's dimensions are approximately half the input grid's dimensions (rounding up). The color present in the input grid, other than black (0), is identified. This non-black color from the input grid is copied to the output grid. The copying process selects pixels from the input at odd row and odd column intersections (every other row and every other column, starting from 0). These selected pixels, if they match the identified non-black color, are copied to corresponding positions in the output grid. The output grid position is calculated by dividing the input row and column indices by 2 (integer division).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
