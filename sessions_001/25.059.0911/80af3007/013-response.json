The primary color involved is gray (5), with a background of white (0). The input grid appears to contain multiple disconnected shapes or regions of gray, while the output grid seems to represent a condensed or abstracted version of these shapes. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple cropping or scaling. It looks more like a complex shape extraction or summarization. There appears to be a focus on maintaining some form of the spatial relationship and relative position/shape of gray areas.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

Note gaps and patterns.\n\n3. **Condense and Extract Pattern:** extract the core regions of gray pixels and create the shape in the smaller grid.\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Fill the output grid with white (0) as the background.
