facts:
  - task: "Condense gray objects into 9x9 grid"
  - input_objects:
      - color: gray (5)
      - properties:
          - contiguous: "True (objects are formed by connected pixels)"
          - shapes: "Variable (rectangles, lines, complex shapes)"
          - arrangement: "Variable (can be scattered or form larger patterns)"
  - output_grid:
      - dimensions: "9x9"
      - content: "Scaled representation of gray objects from input"
  - transformation_properties:
      - type: "Object-based scaling"
      - scaling_factor: "Determined by input and output grid dimensions"
      - shape_preservation: "Desired, but not achieved by initial code"
      - relative_position_preservation: "Partially achieved, needs improvement"
