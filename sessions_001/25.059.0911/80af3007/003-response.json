Both grids contain only the values 0 (white) and 5 (gray). The input grid appears to have two overlapping \"plus\" shaped objects made of gray (5) pixels. The output grid seems to be a condensed, altered representation of the input, maintaining some of the gray pixels but in a different arrangement. The output seems to be a subsampling of the input, selecting every other row and column, but only where grey pixels existed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider only the pixels at odd-numbered rows and odd-numbered columns (starting the count at 1).\n2.  **Conditional Extraction:** For each of these selected positions, check the pixel's value in the *input* grid.\n3.  **Output Construction:** If the pixel at the selected position in the *input* grid is gray (5), then set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (5). Otherwise, if the pixel in the input grid is white (0), set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to white (0). The output grid is formed by these conditionally extracted pixels.\n\nIn essence, the program takes every other row and column of the input, and copies gray pixel from input grid to output grid.\n"
