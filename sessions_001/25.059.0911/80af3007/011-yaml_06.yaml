facts:
  - task: "Replicate and arrange gray objects"
  - objects:
      - color: gray (5)
        shape_types: [cross, T, I]
        input_count: 3
        output_count: 9
        arrangement: "3x3 grid, one of each shape type per row/column"
  - actions:
      - identify: "Locate gray objects in the input grid"
      - sort: "Determine relative vertical position (lowest = middle)"
      - replicate: "Create a fixed number of copies of the gray objects, maintaining their original shape"
      - arrange: "Place the replicated objects in a 3x3 grid"
  - constraints:
      - output_size: "9x9 grid"
      - arrangement_logic: "Shapes are placed in the 3x3 grid based on the relative vertical position in the input grid with the lowest at center.  Each row/column contains each of the shapes"
