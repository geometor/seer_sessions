            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and examples to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code focuses on identifying a red (2) cross within an azure (8) background and extracting a subgrid around it. The code does a pretty good job on the example it was designed for and captures subsequent examples well, with some small errors. The strategy to resolve these is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Boundary Conditions:** The main area of focus for improvement lies in the boundary conditions of the extracted subgrid. The current code uses hard coded offset, but some examples need different offsets.\n2. **Dynamic offsets** Update the code to adjust offsets dynamically\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on what the code *currently* does and how it relates to the expected output.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n*   **Input:** 9x11 grid.\n*   **Expected Output:** 5x7 grid.\n*   **Actual Output:** 5x7 grid.\n*   **Observation:** The code correctly identifies and extracts the cross, including the immediate azure border and an additional column of azure on the left.\n\n**Example 2**\n\n*   **Input:** 11x15 grid.\n*   **Expected Output:** 7 x 9 grid.\n*   **Actual Output:** 7x9 grid\n*   **Observation:** No issues found.\n\n**Example 3**\n\n*   **Input:** 10x13 grid.\n*   **Expected Output:** 5x7 grid.\n*    **Actual Output:** 5x7 grid\n*   **Observation:** No issues found.\n\n**Example 4**\n\n*   **Input:** 8x9 grid.\n*   **Expected Output:** 7x9 grid\n*    **Actual Output:** 7x8\n*   **Observation:** It appears there is a consistent off-by-one error in output grid width\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: cross\n    color: red (2)\n    shape: cross-shaped, defined by connected red pixels\n    properties:\n      - has_center: True\n      - center_pixel_value: 2\n  - object: background\n    color: azure (8)\n    shape: rectangular\n    properties:\n      - surrounds: cross\n  - action: extract\n    subject: cross\n    object: subgrid\n    precondition:\n        - background of azure surrounding the cross\n    properties:\n      - includes_border: True\n      - border_color: azure (8)\n      - border_size: \"variable, at least one azure pixel on the top, bottom and left\"\n      - \"left_border: two azure pixels\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the red (2) cross-shaped object within the input grid. A cross is defined as a central red pixel with directly adjacent red pixels to its top, bottom, left, and right, forming a '+' shape.\n\n2.  **Find the Center:** Determine the center of the cross, which is the red pixel with four adjacent red neighbors.\n\n3. **Determine cross boundaries:** Get the coordinates of the cross boundaries.\n\n4.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid should include the entire cross and a border of azure (8) pixels.\n    *   The border will include at least one pixel on the top, bottom, and right.\n    *   The left border should extend to include at least 2 pixels.\n\n5.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid from the input grid based on calculated dimensions.\n\n6.  **Handle Missing Cross:** If no cross is found, return an empty grid.\n"
