Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large, multi-colored grid. The output is a smaller grid composed of only two colors (azure and red) from the input grid. The output appears to extract a specific pattern, a cross shape, from the input. The dominant color in the large input grid is azure (8). The red (2) forms a plus sign (+) or cross in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_description: |
  Extract a cross-shaped subgrid from a larger input grid.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: Multiple (0-9)
      - size: Large (16x17)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [azure, red] # 8, 2
      - size: Smaller (6x8)
      - shape: cross
  - name: cross_pattern
    type: shape
    properties:
       - color: red
       - structure: vertical and horizontal lines intersecting at the center
actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Isolate the cross pattern and its surrounding azure background.
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid's cross is centered and derived from a similar, less defined shape existing at the center area of input_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the dominant color:** Find the most frequent color in the input grid. In this case, it's azure (8).
2.  **Locate the Cross:** Examine the input grid and search for a cross or plus-shaped structure of same color, not the dominant one. This different color must have continuous horizontal and vertical lines, with same number of this color pixels at both sides.
3.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output is smaller than the input. The size is defined by the horizontal and vertical extent of the non-dominant color forming cross, plus additional rows/columns of dominant color from input
4.  **Extract:** Create the output grid by copying the identified cross pattern and the surrounding dominant-color background based on determined output size.
5. The cross pattern has one azure(8) surrounding row in up and down, and has two azure(8) surrounding columns at left and right.
