            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe code aims to extract a cross-shaped subgrid (formed by red pixels) from a larger grid, including a border of azure pixels. The current implementation seems to correctly identify the cross and its dimensions. However, the handling of the azure border, particularly ensuring its consistent presence, appears to be causing discrepancies when applied to more examples.\n\nThe errors probably stem from the border handling logic:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Border Size**: The code adds one azure pixel around the cross when determining the bounds of the output. The examples seem to require two azure pixels in some cases, but the code isn't consistently handling them.\n2.  **Edge Cases**: The code includes boundary checks (`max(0, out_up)`, etc.) but these checks do not account for all cases where the cross is too close to the edges of the image and there are not enough surrounding azure pixels.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  **Analyze Examples in detail**: Carefully examine all input/output pairs, focusing on the size and position of the cross relative to the grid edges and the resulting border in the output. Use code execution to gather specific dimensions and boundary issues.\n2.  **Refine Border Logic**: Modify the natural language program to specify the required width of the azure border consistently (2 pixels where possible).\n3.  **Improve Edge Handling**: Update the code's boundary checks to enforce minimum dimensions when the desired border width cannot be achieved due to the cross being close to an edge.\n4. **Rewrite natural language program** Make sure that the logic described can be expressed in terms of the priors and accurately describes the transformation.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (using code execution)**\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output_grid):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    expected_output_grid = np.array(expected_output_grid)\n\n    # Find cross center\n    center = None\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 2:\n                # Simplified check (assuming only one cross)\n                center = (r, c)\n                break\n        if center:\n            break\n\n    if not center:\n        return {\n            \"cross_found\": False,\n        }\n\n    # Get cross boundaries\n    center_row, center_col = center\n    up = center_row\n    while up >= 0 and input_grid[up, center_col] == 2:\n        up -= 1\n    down = center_row\n    while down < rows and input_grid[down, center_col] == 2:\n        down += 1\n    left = center_col\n    while left >= 0 and input_grid[center_row, left] == 2:\n        left -= 1\n    right = center_col\n    while right < cols and input_grid[center_row, right] == 2:\n        right += 1\n        \n    cross_height = down - up -1\n    cross_width = right - left - 1\n\n    return {\n        \"cross_found\": True,\n        \"center\": center,\n        \"cross_height\": cross_height,\n        \"cross_width\" : cross_width,\n        \"input_shape\": input_grid.shape,\n        \"expected_output_shape\": expected_output_grid.shape,\n        \"up\": up,\n        \"down\": down,\n        \"left\": left,\n        \"right\": right,\n    }\n\nexamples = [\n    (\n        [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\n        [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\n    ),\n    (\n        [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\n        [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\n    ),\n    (\n       [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\n        [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]],\n    ),\n]\n\nresults = [analyze_example(inp, out) for inp, out in examples]\nfor i, r in enumerate(results):\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    for k, v in r.items():\n        print(f\"  {k}: {v}\")\n\n```"
