The output is a much smaller grid, containing only the numbers 1 and 2 (blue and red, respectively). The output grid appears to be a highly simplified, abstracted representation of the input grid. The striking difference in size and the reduction to only two colors suggests a significant transformation. The input grid looks noisy and random, while the output grid exhibits a clear, repeating checkerboard pattern. The dominant colors in the output seem to be derived from prominent features or regions within the input, but the exact nature of those prominences isn't immediately obvious without a deeper analysis of connected regions or color frequencies.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
