Okay, let's analyze the provided code, training results, and examples to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code focuses on identifying a red (2) cross within an azure (8) background and extracting a subgrid around it. The code does a pretty good job on the example it was designed for and captures subsequent examples well, with some small errors. The strategy to resolve these is to:

1.  **Analyze the Boundary Conditions:** The main area of focus for improvement lies in the boundary conditions of the extracted subgrid. The current code uses hard coded offset, but some examples need different offsets.
2. **Dynamic offsets** Update the code to adjust offsets dynamically

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on what the code *currently* does and how it relates to the expected output.

**Example 1**

*   **Input:** 9x11 grid.
*   **Expected Output:** 5x7 grid.
*   **Actual Output:** 5x7 grid.
*   **Observation:** The code correctly identifies and extracts the cross, including the immediate azure border and an additional column of azure on the left.

**Example 2**

*   **Input:** 11x15 grid.
*   **Expected Output:** 7 x 9 grid.
*   **Actual Output:** 7x9 grid
*   **Observation:** No issues found.

**Example 3**

*   **Input:** 10x13 grid.
*   **Expected Output:** 5x7 grid.
*    **Actual Output:** 5x7 grid
*   **Observation:** No issues found.

**Example 4**

*   **Input:** 8x9 grid.
*   **Expected Output:** 7x9 grid
*    **Actual Output:** 7x8
*   **Observation:** It appears there is a consistent off-by-one error in output grid width

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: cross
    color: red (2)
    shape: cross-shaped, defined by connected red pixels
    properties:
      - has_center: True
      - center_pixel_value: 2
  - object: background
    color: azure (8)
    shape: rectangular
    properties:
      - surrounds: cross
  - action: extract
    subject: cross
    object: subgrid
    precondition:
        - background of azure surrounding the cross
    properties:
      - includes_border: True
      - border_color: azure (8)
      - border_size: "variable, at least one azure pixel on the top, bottom and left"
      - "left_border: two azure pixels"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the red (2) cross-shaped object within the input grid. A cross is defined as a central red pixel with directly adjacent red pixels to its top, bottom, left, and right, forming a '+' shape.

2.  **Find the Center:** Determine the center of the cross, which is the red pixel with four adjacent red neighbors.

3. **Determine cross boundaries:** Get the coordinates of the cross boundaries.

4.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid should include the entire cross and a border of azure (8) pixels.
    *   The border will include at least one pixel on the top, bottom, and right.
    *   The left border should extend to include at least 2 pixels.

5.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the subgrid from the input grid based on calculated dimensions.

6.  **Handle Missing Cross:** If no cross is found, return an empty grid.
