observations:
  - object: yellow_cross
    description: A cross formed by yellow pixels.
    properties:
      center: The location of the initial yellow pixel in the input.
      arms: Extend horizontally and vertically from the center.
      extent: May extend to the edges of the grid or be shorter.

  - object: gray_corners
    description: Gray pixels in the corners of the output grid.
    properties:
      presence: Conditional, based on cross arm extent.
      location: Always at grid corners (0,0), (0, cols-1), (rows-1, 0), (rows-1, cols-1).

  - action: create_cross
    description: Generates the yellow cross centered on the seed pixel.
    input: Input grid, seed pixel location.
    output: Grid with a yellow cross.

  - action: replace_corners
    description: Conditionally places gray pixels in the corners.
    input: Grid with cross, original grid dimensions.
    output: Modified grid with gray corners (potentially).
    condition: Gray pixels appear in a corner IF the yellow cross's arm *does not* reach that edge of the grid in input.
