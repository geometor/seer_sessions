There's a single 2 (red) pixel at the bottom left (row 9, column 1 if we are zero indexing).\n*   The output is also a 10x10 grid. It seems to have a repeating pattern involving 2 (red) and 0 (white) pixels. There are also some 5 (grey) pixels.\n*   The single red pixel in the input seems to have \"expanded\" or \"influenced\" the entire output grid.\n*   There is a specific structure to the distribution of 2,5, and 0 in output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
