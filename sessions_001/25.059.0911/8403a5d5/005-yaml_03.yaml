objects:
  - name: seed_pixel
    properties:
      color: dynamic (value of the non-zero pixel, which is '2' in the examples)
      location: dynamic (row, col of the non-zero pixel)
      role: initiator (starts the propagation)

  - name: propagated_pixels
    properties:
      color: dynamic (same as seed_pixel)
      location: dynamic (determined by propagation rules)
      role: extension (extends the seed's influence)

 - name: five_pixels
    properties:
      color: 5
      location: dynamic (intersection of propagated rows and cols)
      role: intersection

  - name: background_pixels
    properties:
      color: 0
      location: dynamic (all cells not occupied by seed or propagated pixels)
      role: filler

actions:
  - name: find_seed
    description: Locates the non-zero pixel in the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: (row, col) of the seed pixel

  - name: propagate_columns
    description: Extends the seed pixel's color vertically along every other column.
    input: seed_pixel, input_grid
    output: modified_grid (with columns filled)

  - name: propagate_rows
    description: Extends the seed pixel's color horizontally along every other row, starting from the seed row.
    input: seed_pixel, input_grid
    output: modified_grid (with rows filled)

  - name: fill_five
    description: Fills the intersection of the propagated rows and columns with '5'.
    input:  propagated rows and columns
    output: grid with fives

  - name: fill_background
    description: Fills the remaining cells with '0'.
    input: grid (after propagation)
    output: completed output_grid
