The output is also a 10x10 grid. The single yellow pixel in the input seems to have become the seed for a pattern in the output. The output grid maintains the original yellow pixel and adds new pixels, primarily yellow (4) and some gray (5). The gray pixels appear at specific locations within the emerging pattern. The overall structure is a grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
