The primary operation appears to be a selective color replacement or overlay. Specifically, connected regions of the color blue (1) are, in some cases, replaced by green (3). However, not all blue regions are changed, and some instances, blue remains. It also seems like single blue elements are preserved, and the change only affects the larger blue component.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

A connected component is a group of adjacent blue pixels.\n2.  **Measure Region Size:** For each identified blue region, calculate its size (the number of blue pixels it contains).\n3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If a blue region is larger than the threshold defined by the size of the original blue element, replace *all* pixels within that region with green (3).\n4. **Preserve remaining blue pixels**: Any blue region smaller or equal to the original blue is preserved\n5.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the replacements. All other colors and empty spaces remain the same, as do blue elements not meeting the replacement criterion.\n\nFrom the three training examples it could be observed the largest connected components of the blue color are changed to green color.\n"
