The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). There appear to be two distinct regions or objects within the grids: one composed of blue pixels and another that remains unchanged in both input and output, which is also blue. The key change seems to be the replacement of blue (1) with green (3) within a specific, connected region in the top half of the grid. The bottom part of input grid including blue remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
