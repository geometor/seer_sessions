Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair. Here's my breakdown of the example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a single color value (represented by integers 0-9). The input grid appears to have two primary colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grid introduces a third color, green (3), while retaining some of the blues and whites. It seems like the transformation involves replacing certain blue (1) pixels with green (3) pixels. The white pixels stay the same for the most part. The key seems to be finding the rule that governs which blues become greens.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 15x15
      - cells: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - white (0)
          - blue (1)
          - green (3)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Change the color value of a pixel.
    parameters:
      - object: pixel
      - from_color: blue (1)
      - to_color: green (3)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains all pixels.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement**: For each blue pixel:
    *   If the blue pixel is part of a contiguous block of 2 or more blue pixels (horizontally, vertically *or* diagonally connected), change it to a green pixel.
3.  **Preserve**: White pixels remain unchanged.

Essentially, blue regions that are 1x1 should stay as blue, all other blue should become green.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
