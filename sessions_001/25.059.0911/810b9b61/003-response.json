Here's my breakdown of the example:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves a grid of pixels, each with a single color value (represented by integers 0-9). The input grid appears to have two primary colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grid introduces a third color, green (3), while retaining some of the blues and whites. It seems like the transformation involves replacing certain blue (1) pixels with green (3) pixels. The white pixels stay the same for the most part. The key seems to be finding the rule that governs which blues become greens.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
