The input grid appears to be composed of single-digit integers, each representing a different color. The output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input, with some kind of pattern or rule governing the expansion. The black borders seem important to how the shapes are constructed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Iterate the input row by row. First copy the 3 input pixels to make row 1 of the output.\n5. Copy row 1 as row 2 of the output.\n6. Move to the next input row.\n7. Copy input row 2 to rows 3 and 4 of the output.\n8. Repeat step 7 for the final row of the input to produce output rows 5 and 6.\n\nEssentially, each pixel from the input grid becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid in two steps, first expand to the right to double the columns, then expand down by copying the expanded row.\n"
