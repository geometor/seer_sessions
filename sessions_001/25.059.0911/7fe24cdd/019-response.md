Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be smaller (3x3) than the output grid (6x6). The colors present are white (0), green (3), and magenta (6). The output grid seems to be a "mirrored" or "expanded" version of the input, with the colors alternating in a checkerboard-like pattern. The mirroring seems to be both horizontal and vertical. The black borders might need to be ignored and treated as an artifact.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: 3x3
        output: 6x6
      cells:
        values: [0, 3, 6]  # White, Green, Magenta
        descriptions:
          0: white pixel
          3: green pixel
          6: magenta pixel

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Doubles the size of the grid in both dimensions.
  - name: mirror_fill
    description: Fills the expanded grid by alternating/mirroring the original pixel values.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a spatially expanded and mirrored version of the input grid.
  - type: color_alternation
    description:  Colors in the expanded grid alternate based on their position, creating a checkerboard-like pattern from mirroring the original.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Expansion:** Take the input grid and double its size in both dimensions (width and height). This creates a new, empty grid four times the size of the original.

2. **Mirroring and Filling:**  Iterate through the cells of the *original* input grid. For each cell:
    - Place the original cell's color in the corresponding position in the expanded grid, then fill it in a 2x2 block of the same value.  This creates the size doubling effect.
    - Or, looking at the output grid:
        *   Copy the original value to the `[row][col]` location.
        *   Copy the original value to the `[row][col + original_width]` location.
        *   Copy the original value to the `[row + original_height][col]` location.
        *   Copy the original value to the `[row + original_height][col+ original_width]`
            location.

3. **Result:** The expanded grid is now filled, with the colors from the original grid mirrored and repeated to create the checkerboard type design.
