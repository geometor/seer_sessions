            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, correctly identifying the expansion of the grid from 3x3 to 6x6 and attempting to map pixels from the input to the output. However, the initial cross-pattern mapping logic is incorrect, as evidenced by the differences found in all test cases. The transformation isn't a simple cross pattern but rather a duplication and arrangement of the input pixels in a specific 2x2 block pattern in the output grid. The core issue is understanding and correctly formulating this specific duplication pattern. The existing tests show differences from the expected results.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Examine the `differences` output from the `compare_grids` function for each example. This will pinpoint exactly which pixels are being mapped incorrectly. Pay close attention to the input and output positions and colors.\n2.  **Pattern Identification:** From the error analysis, identify the *correct* mapping rule. It's likely a form of block duplication and repetition, not a cross pattern.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Re-describe the transformation rule based on the correct mapping. Be very specific about how input pixels relate to output pixels. Use terms like \"top-left,\" \"bottom-right,\" \"duplicate,\" and \"repeat\" if they apply.\n4.  **Revise Code:** Translate the refined natural language program into updated Python code.\n5.  **Re-test:** Run the updated code against all training examples and ensure all differences are eliminated.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nLet's break down each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], [4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 6], [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], [4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 6], [7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9], [7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9]]`\n    *   Differences: The provided code and test reveal that a cross pattern logic is incorrect, it should be a 2 x 2 block pattern\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8]]`\n    *   Differences: The provided code and test reveal that a cross pattern logic is incorrect, it should be a 2 x 2 block pattern\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 5, 5], [5, 3, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5], [5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]`\n    *    Differences: The provided code and test reveal that a cross pattern logic is incorrect, it should be a 2 x 2 block pattern\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 4, 5], [4, 4, 4], [5, 4, 5]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5], [5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5], [5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5]]`\n    *   Differences: The provided code and test reveal that a cross pattern logic is incorrect, it should be a 2 x 2 block pattern\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: grid\n    dimensions: 3x3\n    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n    properties:\n      - Each cell contains a single color value.\n\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: grid\n    dimensions: 6x6\n    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n    properties:\n      - Each cell contains a single color value.\n      - Appears to be a patterned expansion of the input_grid.\n\nactions:\n  - name: expand\n    agent: system\n    input: input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n    description: The input grid is expanded to a 6x6 grid.\n    details: Each pixel in the input_grid appears to create a 2 x 2 block of the same value.\n\n  - name: map_pixels\n    agent: system\n    input: input_grid pixel coordinates (i, j)\n    output: output_grid pixel coordinates\n    details:  Each input pixel (i,j) maps to four output pixels. This mapping creates four quadrants using a 2x2 duplication of the input pixel's color.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create a 6x6 output grid filled with zeros.\n2.  **Expansion:** For each pixel (at coordinates `i`, `j`) in the 3x3 input grid:\n    *   Take the color value of the input pixel.\n    *   Replicate this color value in a 2x2 block within the output grid.\n    *   The top-left corner of this 2x2 block is at output grid coordinates (`2i`, `2j`).\n    * In other words, place copies of the color value in the following locations\n      *   output\\[2\\*i, 2\\*j]\n      *   output\\[2\\*i + 1, 2\\*j]\n      *   output\\[2\\*i, 2\\*j + 1]\n      *    output\\[2\\*i+1, 2\\*j+1]\n3. **Output:** Return the completed 6x6 output grid.\n"
