Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (6x6). The colors in the input grid seem to be preserved and rearranged in the output grid, along with some apparent mirroring or reflection. The output grid appears to be some kind of expansion and reflection of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers representing colors
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers representing colors
  - observation: output grid is larger than input grid
  - observation: colors from input grid are present in output grid
  - relationship: output grid appears to be a reflection/expansion of input grid
  - action: reflection
    axis: both horizontal and vertical
  - action: expansion
    factor: 2 (input dimensions doubled)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** The input grid is expanded to double its original dimensions. The 3x3 input becomes a 6x6 output.

2.  **Reflection:**
    *   The original 3x3 input grid occupies the top-left quadrant of the 6x6 output grid.
    *   The top-right quadrant of the output is a vertically reflected image of the top-left quadrant
    *   The bottom-left quadrant of the output is a horizontally reflected image of the top-left quadrant
    *   The bottom-right quadrant is both a horizontally and vertically reflected image of the top-left, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation.

In summary, the transformation rule takes the input grid, doubles its size, and fills the expanded grid by reflecting the original grid across both horizontal and vertical axes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
