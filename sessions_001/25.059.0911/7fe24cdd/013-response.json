The colors in the input grid seem to be preserved and rearranged in the output grid, along with some apparent mirroring or reflection. The output grid appears to be some kind of expansion and reflection of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The 3x3 input becomes a 6x6 output.\n\n2.  **Reflection:**\n    *   The original 3x3 input grid occupies the top-left quadrant of the 6x6 output grid.\n    *   The top-right quadrant of the output is a vertically reflected image of the top-left quadrant\n    *   The bottom-left quadrant of the output is a horizontally reflected image of the top-left quadrant\n    *   The bottom-right quadrant is both a horizontally and vertically reflected image of the top-left, which is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule takes the input grid, doubles its size, and fills the expanded grid by reflecting the original grid across both horizontal and vertical axes.\n"
