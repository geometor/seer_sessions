Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was a good first attempt, correctly identifying the expansion of the grid from 3x3 to 6x6 and attempting to map pixels from the input to the output. However, the initial cross-pattern mapping logic is incorrect, as evidenced by the differences found in all test cases. The transformation isn't a simple cross pattern but rather a duplication and arrangement of the input pixels in a specific 2x2 block pattern in the output grid. The core issue is understanding and correctly formulating this specific duplication pattern. The existing tests show differences from the expected results.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Examine the `differences` output from the `compare_grids` function for each example. This will pinpoint exactly which pixels are being mapped incorrectly. Pay close attention to the input and output positions and colors.
2.  **Pattern Identification:** From the error analysis, identify the *correct* mapping rule. It's likely a form of block duplication and repetition, not a cross pattern.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Re-describe the transformation rule based on the correct mapping. Be very specific about how input pixels relate to output pixels. Use terms like "top-left," "bottom-right," "duplicate," and "repeat" if they apply.
4.  **Revise Code:** Translate the refined natural language program into updated Python code.
5.  **Re-test:** Run the updated code against all training examples and ensure all differences are eliminated.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's break down each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], [4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 6], [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], [4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 6], [7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9], [7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9]]`
    *   Differences: The provided code and test reveal that a cross pattern logic is incorrect, it should be a 2 x 2 block pattern

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8], [8, 1, 8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8]]`
    *   Differences: The provided code and test reveal that a cross pattern logic is incorrect, it should be a 2 x 2 block pattern

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[5, 5, 5], [5, 3, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5], [5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]`
    *    Differences: The provided code and test reveal that a cross pattern logic is incorrect, it should be a 2 x 2 block pattern

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `[[5, 4, 5], [4, 4, 4], [5, 4, 5]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5], [5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5], [5, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5]]`
    *   Differences: The provided code and test reveal that a cross pattern logic is incorrect, it should be a 2 x 2 block pattern

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      - Each cell contains a single color value.

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    properties:
      - Each cell contains a single color value.
      - Appears to be a patterned expansion of the input_grid.

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: system
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: The input grid is expanded to a 6x6 grid.
    details: Each pixel in the input_grid appears to create a 2 x 2 block of the same value.

  - name: map_pixels
    agent: system
    input: input_grid pixel coordinates (i, j)
    output: output_grid pixel coordinates
    details:  Each input pixel (i,j) maps to four output pixels. This mapping creates four quadrants using a 2x2 duplication of the input pixel's color.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 6x6 output grid filled with zeros.
2.  **Expansion:** For each pixel (at coordinates `i`, `j`) in the 3x3 input grid:
    *   Take the color value of the input pixel.
    *   Replicate this color value in a 2x2 block within the output grid.
    *   The top-left corner of this 2x2 block is at output grid coordinates (`2i`, `2j`).
    * In other words, place copies of the color value in the following locations
      *   output\[2\*i, 2\*j]
      *   output\[2\*i + 1, 2\*j]
      *   output\[2\*i, 2\*j + 1]
      *    output\[2\*i+1, 2\*j+1]
3. **Output:** Return the completed 6x6 output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
