Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a two-step expansion. First, each pixel in the input 3x3 grid is expanded horizontally to become two pixels.  Then, each resulting row is duplicated to create a 6x6 grid.

"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize an empty 3x6 grid for the first expansion phase.
    intermediate_grid = np.zeros((3, 6), dtype=int)

    # Horizontal expansion: Each pixel becomes two.
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            intermediate_grid[i, 2*j] = input_grid[i, j]
            intermediate_grid[i, 2*j + 1] = input_grid[i, j]

    # Initialize the final 6x6 output grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros((6, 6), dtype=int)

    # Vertical expansion: Duplicate each row from the intermediate grid.
    for i in range(3):
        output_grid[2*i, :] = intermediate_grid[i, :]
        output_grid[2*i + 1, :] = intermediate_grid[i, :]
        
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
