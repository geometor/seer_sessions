The input grid contains a few colored pixels (represented by numbers 1-9, with 0 being white/background) scattered across the grid.  It appears that a cluster of pixels in the top-left corner (colors 2, 1, and 3) and a single gray pixel (5) are the primary elements of interest. The output grid seems to be a vertically mirrored/flipped version of the non-zero, non-background pixels of the top-left cluster and then placed this mirrored object at the bottom, aligned with the original column positions. The gray pixel has disappeared.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Also identify `pixel_1`, which is equal to color 5.\n2.  **Mirror:** Create a vertically mirrored copy of `cluster_1`. The mirror axis is the horizontal line passing through the vertical center of the original object (`cluster_1`).\n3.  **Translate:** Move the mirrored cluster to the bottom of the grid. Maintain the original column positions of each pixel within the cluster. In the new grid the mirrored cluster starts in the row that has the same number in the complete grid as the first row below `cluster_1` in the input grid.\n4.  **Remove:** Remove pixel of color 5 (`pixel_1`) from the grid.\n5. **Output**: Combine all transformed clusters and remaining pixels to generate output grid\n\n"
