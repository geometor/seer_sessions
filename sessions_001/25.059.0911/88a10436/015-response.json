Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary change appears to be the relocation of a group of colored pixels, while a single gray pixel ('5') in the input is removed. The colored pixels seem to maintain their relative positions and structure during the relocation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There is a vertical translation with minimal change to x.\n5.  The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same, fill the rest with white.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule is to *remove the grey pixel and move a complex of red, green, and blue pixels to the top, while preserving the structure*.\n"
