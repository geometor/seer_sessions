```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Create a NumPy array from the input grid for easier manipulation.
    input_np = np.array(input_grid)

    # Extract the top-left 2x2 sub-grid using array slicing.
    output_np = input_np[:2, :2]

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list.
    output_grid = output_np.tolist()

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was extremely simple, extracting only the top-left 2x2 subgrid. This approach, while correct for the provided training examples, doesn't generalize to any case where different colors or more complex reasoning may be present, but luckily the structure of the training examples is sufficient to identify the pattern. It highlights the importance of having diverse training examples. The results show that this simple rule worked on all given examples. This strongly suggests that the core logic of the task is to isolate a specific region of the input.

**Strategy:**

Since all the results show perfect prediction, the strategy is to document a clear and concise natural language program and facts describing the observed transformation, and prepare for any modifications on a test case if needed.

**Metrics and Example Analysis:**

Because all of the train examples were successful, there is no need to provide detailed metrics.

All examples show a consistent pattern:
*   Input grids have varying dimensions.
*   Output grids are always 2x2.
*   Output grid is always the top-left 2x2 section of the input grid.
*    All pixels in input and output are 'gray' (value 5).

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid consistently represents a 2x2 subgrid extracted from the top-left corner of the input grid.
  - object_properties:
      - object: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
          - dimensions: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30
      - object: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
          - dimensions: 2x2, constant
  - transformation_rule: |
      The transformation extracts the top-left 2x2 portion of the input grid to create the output grid.
  - color_consistency:
      - All input and output grids in provided examples contain only gray (5) pixels.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the top-left corner:** Locate the pixel at the (0, 0) index of the input grid (row 0, column 0).
2.  **Extract 2x2 subgrid:**  Select the 2x2 area starting from the identified top-left corner. This includes pixels at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1).
3.  **Form the output:**  The selected 2x2 subgrid becomes the output grid.

This program describes taking a 2x2 subgrid and setting that as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
