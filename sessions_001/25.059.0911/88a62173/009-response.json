The colors involved are primarily blue (1) and white (0). The output grid seems to be a condensed or summarized version of the input grid, focusing on the blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For each cell in the output grid, determine its value based on the presence of blue pixels in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid:\n    *   If a quadrant contains blue pixels on the top and bottom, the corresponding output will be blue.\n    *   If a quadrant has only one row and it is at the top with blue pixels, keep only top-left.\n    * If a quadrent has two rows and one of them contains blue pixels, the corrsponding output will be blue.\n    * If a quadrant contains one blue pixel in the bottom row and one in top row, the result will be blue.\n    *   Otherwise, the output cell is white.\n\nIn more general form:\n\n1. Find the blue pixels.\n2. Create a bounding box around each blue pixel.\n3. Find where bounding boxes overlap (intersect).\n4. If there is an overlap, set the output for that section to blue.\n5. The output size will be the new range size divided by the original size.\n\nIn essence, the program extracts and represents \"islands of blue color.\"\n"
