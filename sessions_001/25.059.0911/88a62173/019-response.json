            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code extracts the four corner pixels and arranges them into a 2x2 grid. This approach works for some cases but fails when the core concept involves more than just corner extraction. The strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Error Analysis:** Carefully examine the cases where the output doesn't match the expected output. This involves looking at properties beyond just corners, such as shapes, colors, and spatial relationships.\n2.  **Object Identification:** Identify recurring objects or patterns within the input and output grids.\n3.  **Transformation Rule Refinement:** Update the natural language program to accurately reflect the relationship between the input and output, going beyond simple corner extraction.\n4.  **Consideration of Priors:** Use core ARC priors (objectness, goal-directedness, numbers/counting, geometry/topology) to guide the analysis.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nHere is a summary of what the code did, and how to correct the understanding of\nthe task:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, corners are different colors\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2, matches the corners of the input.\n    *   Actual Output: Correct.\n    *   Notes: initial assumption (extracting corners) is correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 5x5, all corners are black (0)\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2, all black.\n    *   Actual Output: Correct.\n    *   Notes: reinforces the corner extraction idea.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid. Corners different colors.\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 matches the corners\n    *   Actual Output: Correct.\n    *    Notes: again reinforces the corner extraction.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 6x6. corners are different.\n    *   Expected: 2x2 matches the corners.\n    *   Actual Output: correct.\n    *   Notes: reinforces the corner extraction.\n\nAll test examples matched correctly. This is a good indication the algorithm is\nworking correctly.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 007bbfb7\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The input grids vary in size, but the output grid is always 2x2.\n  - object_identification: |\n      The four corner pixels of the input grid are distinct objects.\n  - property_description: |\n      Corner pixels can have different colors.\n  - action_description: |\n      The four corner pixels are extracted from the input grid.\n  - action_description: |\n      The extracted corner pixels are placed into a 2x2 output grid, maintaining their original relative positions (top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left).\n  - constraint: |\n      The size of the output is fixed at 2x2.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify** the four corner pixels of the input grid: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.\n2.  **Extract** the color values of these four corner pixels.\n3.  **Create** a 2x2 output grid.\n4.  **Place** the top-left corner pixel from the input into the top-left position (0,0) of the output grid.\n5.  **Place** the top-right corner pixel from the input into the top-right position (0,1) of the output grid.\n6.  **Place** the bottom-right corner pixel from the input into the bottom-right position (1,1) of the output grid.\n7.  **Place** the bottom-left corner pixel from the input into the bottom-left position (1,0) of the output grid.\n"
