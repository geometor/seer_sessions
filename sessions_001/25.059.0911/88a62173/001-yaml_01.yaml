facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents a grid of colored pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x2
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents a smaller grid derived from the input grid.
  - observation: alternating_pattern
    description: The input grid shows an alternating pattern of two colors, one of which is always white (0). The non-zero pixels alternate positions in the input grid
  - observation: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (2x2 vs. 5x5).
  - observation: color_correspondence
    description: The colors present in the output grid are a subset of the colors in the input grid.
  - observation: position:
      description: The 2x2 output seems to derive, somehow, from the top-left region, although it is not a direct copy
