Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by integers, with 0 being white and 2 being red. The input grid is larger (5x5) than the output grid (2x2). The output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of the input, preserving some, but not all, of the input's information. The transformation appears to focus on specific regions or features of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      cells: [integer values representing colors]
    actions:
      - transformation: reducing dimensions
      - selection: extracting a sub-grid
    relationships:
      - input_grid: relates to output_grid via transformation
  - type: cell
    properties:
      color: [integer value]
      position: [row, column]
    relationships:
      - part_of: grid

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Top-Left 2x2 Sub-grid:** Focus on the 2x2 sub-grid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.

2. **Extract the values**: copy this 2x2 section
3.  **Output:** The final output *is* the 2x2 extracted part.

In simpler terms, the transformation extracts the top-left 2x2 portion of the input grid and presents it as the output.
