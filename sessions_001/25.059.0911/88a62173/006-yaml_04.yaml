facts:
  - observation: |
      The output grid consistently represents a 2x2 subgrid extracted from the top-left corner of the input grid.
  - object_properties:
      - object: input_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
          - dimensions: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30
      - object: output_grid
        properties:
          - type: 2D array
          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
          - dimensions: 2x2, constant
  - transformation_rule: |
      The transformation extracts the top-left 2x2 portion of the input grid to create the output grid.
  - color_consistency:
      - All input and output grids in provided examples contain only gray (5) pixels.
