observations:
  - example_set: Training
    example_number: 1-5
    object_types:
      - grid:
          properties:
            - color: single color (gray - 5)
            - shape: varies (rows x columns)
          transformations:
            - output_size_constant: All output grids are 2x2.
            - color_consistency:  The output grid retains the color of the input grid.
            - content_replication: The content of the top-left 2x2 region of the input is replicated in the output.
