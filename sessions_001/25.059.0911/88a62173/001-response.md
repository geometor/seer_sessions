Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the underlying transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 2D grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller 2D grid. The input grids are 5x5, and the output grids are 2x2.  The key seems to be a pattern of alternating colors within the input grid, and some kind of selection or extraction process that creates the output grid. The colors involved change in each example (red/white, blue/white, azure/white), but the white (0) seems consistent as a sort of background or separator. The significant (non-zero) colors seems to form 2x2 blocks in upper-left of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents a grid of colored pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      dimensions: 2x2
      elements: integers (0-9)
      description: Represents a smaller grid derived from the input grid.
  - observation: alternating_pattern
    description: The input grid shows an alternating pattern of two colors, one of which is always white (0). The non-zero pixels alternate positions in the input grid
  - observation: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid (2x2 vs. 5x5).
  - observation: color_correspondence
    description: The colors present in the output grid are a subset of the colors in the input grid.
  - observation: position:
      description: The 2x2 output seems to derive, somehow, from the top-left region, although it is not a direct copy
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the two distinct colors:**  In the input grid, identify the two colors that form the alternating pattern. One of these colors will be white (0).
2. **Locate Non-Zero Color Blocks:** Examine the top-left 2x2 section, and surrounding pixels. Note the non-zero numbers.
3. **Extract Top-Left, Bottom-Right, and Diagonals** The output is formed by checking a 2x2 grid at top-left and moving diagonally. The input has an alternating pattern.
4. **Construct Output:** Create the 2x2 output grid. Place the non-zero pixels in a clockwise spiral starting from the top-left: Top-left, Top-right, Bottom-right, Bottom-Left.

In summary: extract values of upper left 2 x 2 and place into a clockwise pattern.
