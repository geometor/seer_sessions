objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - description: Contains pixels of different colors.
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - values: 0-9
      - description: Represents a color.
  - name: shape
    properties:
      - type: contiguous block of pixels of the same color
      - description:  Shapes can have specific properties depending on their color and configuration, which affects the transformation.
  - name: azure_shape # Specific color-based shape, present in examples 1, 2
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - description: Acts a positional marker, with parts of the grid being transformed in the same location.
  - name: red_shape  # another color-based shape, present in examples 1
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - description: This shape fills parts of a different shape in the same relative location.
  - name: yellow_shape
    properties:
        - color: yellow (4)
  - name: light_blue_shape
      properties:
          - color: light_blue (8)

actions:
  - name: copy_pixels
    description: Copy certain pixels from one location to another. The source and destination seem to depend on relative positions of colored shapes.
  - name: replace_pixels
    description: Specific pixels of one shape are copied by the pixels from the target shape

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative position of the shapes (e.g., azure, red, yellow) is crucial for determining the transformation.  The transformation often involves copying pixels from one shape to where another shape _would be_.
