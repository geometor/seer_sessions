    *   If the horizontal span is 5 or greater, examine each pixel:

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against all the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. The tests show that while the code works correctly for the first example, it fails on the second and partially on the third. The primary issue seems to be the strict horizontal adjacency and span calculation, and potentially the handling of multiple, disconnected regions.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input/output pair, including the code's output, to pinpoint exactly where the logic deviates from the expected transformation.
2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use code execution (where applicable) to verify assumptions, e.g. region sizes, colors above.
3.  **Fact Extraction:** Create a YAML block to list key observations about objects (regions of color), their properties (size, position, color), and relationships (adjacency).
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, revise the natural language program to accurately reflect the transformation rule across *all* training examples. The rule should generalize, not just work for a single case.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Let's break down each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Two azure regions, one with span 5, one with span 2. The region with span 5 has pixels directly above, which are black.
    *   Expected Output: The azure region with span 5 is replaced by black. The other azure region remains unchanged.
    *   Actual Output: Matches expected.
    *   Metrics: Confirmed via visual inspection and previous code execution that span calculation and replacement worked correctly.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: One azure region with span 3, one with span 2, and multiple other single azure pixels scattered.
    *    Expected output: all azure replaced by pixel above.
    *   Actual Output: All azure remains unchanged.
    *   Metrics:

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      objects:
        - color: azure
          regions:
            - span: 5
              adjacent: false
            - span: 2
              adjacent: false
      action: replace azure with color above if a pixel exists above, only for the region with span >= 5

  - example_2:
      objects:
        - color: azure
          regions: multiple single pixels and regions up to span 3
      action: replace all azure with color above

  - example_3:
      objects:
        - color: azure
          regions: multiple single pixels and one region of 1x2
      action: replace all azure with color above
```

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For *every* azure pixel:
    *   Check for a pixel directly above.
    *   If a pixel exists directly above, replace the azure pixel with the color of the pixel above.
    *   If there's no pixel directly above, retain the original azure color (8).
3. No action for other colours.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
