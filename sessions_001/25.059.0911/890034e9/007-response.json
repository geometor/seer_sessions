Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 21x21 grids.\n*   **Colors:** The grids use colors 0 (white), 3 (green), 4 (yellow), and 8 (azure).\n*   **Shapes:** There are irregular shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color.\n*   **Specific Change:** The most obvious change is a block of azure (8) in the input, that gets segmented or parts are replaced by other colours in a specific pattern, in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Replace the first and last two 8s with colour of cell directly above. If there is no cell directly above (at edge of grid) maintain 8.\n        2.  Within the now shortened azure region (with 2 cells at start/end removed) replace with colour directly above. If there is no cell directly above, maintain 8.\n\nEssentially, the transformation selectively replaces parts of the azure (8) regions based on their horizontal extension and position of other colours in the column above.\n"
