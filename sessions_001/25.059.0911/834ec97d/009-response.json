The input grid contains a single magenta (6) pixel in the center, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces yellow (4) pixels in a specific pattern around the central magenta pixel, while also maintaining some white (0) pixels, and leaves some white (0) pixels unchanged. The overall grid dimensions seem to increase.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
