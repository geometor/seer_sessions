Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Center:** Find the magenta (6) pixel in the input grid. This is the center (row 2, col 2 considering 0 based indexing).
2.  **Draw above**: move up three rows, then draw a line of yellow (4) pixels the same width as the grid.
3.  **Draw Middle**: draw two rows up from the center, a line of yellow (4), replacing white (0) and leaving other colors unchanged.
4.  **Keep Center:** Maintain the magenta (6) pixel at its original location.
5. **Leave the rest**: Leave everything else as white (0)

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it correctly identified the magenta pixel as a center and drew yellow lines relative to it. However, the other training examples showed errors. The logic for drawing the second row of yellow needed adjustment - originally based only on the center. The other errors show that the logic should only draw where the original grid was white.

Here's the refined strategy:

1.  **Refine 'Draw Middle' Logic:** The second yellow line should consider all white, not based on the magenta center..
2.  **Preserve existing pixels:** When drawing we should only be replacing white, and drawing the same length as the input grid width

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformations, I'll analyze each input-output pair, focusing on:

*   Presence and location of the magenta pixel.
*   Dimensions of the input and output grids.
*   Placement of yellow lines.
*   Changes in other pixels

Here is a table summarizing results:

| Example | Input Grid     | Center (Magenta) | Output Grid         | Observations & Errors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :------ | :------------- | :--------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | 5x5     | (2,2)        | 5x5  | Correct. Yellow lines are drawn relative to the magenta pixel and on original white. |
| 2       | 5x5            | (2,2)       | 5x5        | Incorrect. Yellow lines do not match, it must consider all white                                                          |
| 3       | 3x3    |  None                | 3x3       | Incorrect. Yellow lines should not appear if there is no magenta.                         |

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: "e150f051"
  - input_grid_dimensions: [5x5, 5x5, 3x3]
  - output_grid_dimensions: [5x5, 5x5, 3x3]
  - objects:
      - name: center_pixel
        color: magenta (6)
        exists: [true, true, false]  # Exists in examples 1 and 2, but not 3
        location: [(2,2), (2,2), null]
      - name: yellow_line_1
        color: yellow (4)
        relative_position: "top of the grid"
        condition: "replaces all white pixels"
      - name: yellow_line_2
        color: yellow (4)
        relative_position: "wherever white exists in the input"
        condition: "replaces all white pixels"
  - actions:
      - name: draw_line
        object: yellow_line
        condition: "if the center pixel exists and on white pixels only"

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Check for Center:** Determine if a magenta (6) pixel exists in the input grid. If it doesn't exist, make the entire output grid white.
2.  **Draw Top Line:** If the magenta pixel exists, draw a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels across the entire first row of the grid, only replacing original white pixels.
3.  **Draw other Lines**: draw a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels, the same width of the grid, replacing only white pixels in the input.

This revised program addresses the core issues:

*   It handles the case where no magenta pixel is present.
*   It correctly draws yellow lines.
*   It accurately reflects that only white pixels should be transformed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
