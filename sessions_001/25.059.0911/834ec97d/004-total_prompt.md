**input:**
```

0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D67CBE7AA50>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a single non-zero pixel (value 2, which is red). The output grid contains two non-zero pixels: the original red pixel (2) has moved down one row, and a new yellow pixel (4) appears in the original location of the red pixel. All other pixels are zero (white).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
  - object: pixel_red
    color: red
    value: 2
    initial_position: [0, 1]
    final_position: [1,1]
  - object: pixel_yellow
    color: yellow
    value: 4
    initial_position: null
    final_position: [0, 1]
  - action: move_down
    object: pixel_red
    parameters: 1 row
  - action: create
    object: pixel_yellow
    location: pixel_red.initial_position
  - background:
      color: white
      value: 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the single red pixel (value 2) in the input grid.
2.  Record the original position of the red pixel.
3.  Move the red pixel down by one row.
4.  Create a new yellow pixel (value 4) at the original position of the red pixel.
5.  All the other cells maintain the background color of 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
