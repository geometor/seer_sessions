objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        - width: number of columns
        - height: number of rows
  - shape:
      type: connected component
      elements: contiguous pixels of the same non-background color
      properties:
        - color: initial color of the shape
        - outline: set of pixels forming the shape boundary
        - interior: set of pixels inside the shape boundary
  - background:
      type: connected component
      elements: pixels not belonging to the primary shape, usually color 0
      properties:
       - color: background color (usually 0)

actions:
  - color_inversion:
      description:  inverts pixel colors in crossing areas and adjacent areas.
      parameters:
        - affected_area: locations where the colors will be inverted.
  - color_fill:
     description: Fill background areas of the primary shape based on the crossing.
     parameters:
       - new_color: replacement colors based on original color of the primary shape.

relationships:
  - spatial:
    - adjacency: pixels directly next to each other (horizontally or vertically)
    - containment: pixels within the boundary of the primary shape
    - intersection: pixels where parts of the shape cross
