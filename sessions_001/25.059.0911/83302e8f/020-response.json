These lines define the boundaries of fully enclosed areas.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the grid that is *not* a maroon pixel (9).\n\n3.  **Determine Fill Color:** For the current pixel:\n    *   Check adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right) one step at a time. Stop searching in a direction if a maroon (9) pixel is encountered. Record the color of any non-background and non-maroon pixel first encountered in any direction.\n    *   Apply these fill rules:\n        *   If *no* colored neighbors are found (only maroon boundary pixels or empty pixels), fill the current pixel with yellow (4).\n        *   If *only* yellow (4) neighbors are found, fill the current pixel with green (3).\n        *   If *only* green (3) neighbors are found, fill the current pixel with yellow (4).\n        *   If a *mix* of green (3) and yellow (4) neighbors is found, *do not change* the current pixel.\n\n4.  **Fill Pixel:** Update the output grid by setting the current pixel to the `fill_color` determined in the previous step. If no change is needed, keep original color.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef check_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    neighbors = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for dr, dc in [(0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]:  # Left, Right, Up, Down\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        while 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            if grid[nr, nc] == 9:\n                break\n            if grid[nr,nc] != 0:\n                neighbors.append(grid[nr,nc])\n                break\n            nr, nc = nr + dr, nc + dc\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # iterate through pixels\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # process only if it is not maroon\n            if output_grid[r,c] != 9:\n                # determine fill color\n                neighbors = check_neighbors(output_grid, r, c)\n                fill_color = 0 # default, means no change\n                if not neighbors:\n                    fill_color = 4\n                elif all(neighbor == 4 for neighbor in neighbors):\n                    fill_color = 3\n                elif all(neighbor == 3 for neighbor in neighbors):\n                    fill_color = 4\n\n                #fill pixel\n                if fill_color != 0:\n                    output_grid[r,c] = fill_color\n    return output_grid\n```"
