Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Maroon Boundaries:** Locate all horizontal and vertical lines formed by maroon (9) pixels in the input grid. These lines define the boundaries of enclosed areas.
2.  **Iterate Through Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the grid that is not a maroon pixel (9).
3.  **Determine Fill Color for Current Pixel:**
      - Get the color values of adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right), stopping the search if a maroon pixel is encountered in that direction.
      - If no colored neighbors are found (only maroon or empty), fill with yellow(4).
      - If only yellow neighbors are found, fill with green(3)
      - If only green neighbors are found, fill with yellow(4).
      - If there are both green and yellow neighbors, do not change the pixel.
4.  **Fill Pixel:** Change the current pixel in the output grid to the determined fill color.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
