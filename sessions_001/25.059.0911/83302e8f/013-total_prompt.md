"""
1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Locate all blue (1) pixels that form continuous horizontal and vertical lines. These lines serve as boundaries for the filling process.

2.  **Flood Fill with Green (3):** Starting from any black (0) pixel, change its color to green (3). Continue expanding this green region in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a blue (1) pixel line or the edge of the grid is encountered. Repeat this for all disconnected black regions until no more black pixels can be filled with green.

3.  **Flood Fill with Yellow (4):** Starting from any remaining black (0) pixel, change its color to yellow (4). Continue expanding in all four directions until any of the following is encountered:
    *   A blue (1) pixel.
    *   A green (3) pixel.
    *   Two edges of the grid (e.g. a corner or a black region adjacent to two non-connected edges)

4. Repeat step 3 until there are no more black pixels.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
