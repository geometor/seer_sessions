Previous Code:

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Blue Lines:** Locate all blue (1) pixels forming continuous vertical and horizontal lines. These lines act as barriers.
2.  **Flood Fill with Green:** Starting from any black(0) pixels, change to green(3) until a blue(1) pixel line is hit.
3. **Flood Fill with Yellow** Starting from any remaining black pixels, change to yellow(4) until a boundary consisting of any combination of 2 or more blue lines or the edge of the grid is hit.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on observations from the first training example. It seems the concept of "flood fill" with different colors based on proximity to blue lines was a good starting point. However, the provided code and description has errors that must be addressed. The primary issue seems to be the handling of yellow and understanding multiple connected components of the same color. The current approach has limitations when multiple separated regions of black exist, especially near corners or multiple blue lines.

The strategy to address these issues will involve:

1.  **Precise Boundary Definition:** Clearly define the boundaries for both green and yellow fills. The current description is ambiguous, especially for yellow.
2.  **Connected Component Analysis:** Consider the possibility of needing to identify and process separate regions (connected components) of black pixels independently.
3.  **Refined Flood Fill:** Ensure the flood fill algorithm correctly handles boundaries and does not "leak" into unintended areas.
4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the revised code and natural language program against *all* training examples after each modification, not just the first one.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of what happened with the provided code on the other training examples:

*   **Example 1:** Works perfectly as per the initial rule and code

*   **Example 2:**
    *   The output is not correct.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
  - name: blue_lines
    type: line segments
    description: Horizontal and vertical lines formed by contiguous blue (1) pixels. Act as boundaries.
  - name: green_regions
    type: area
    description: Regions filled with green (3) pixels, bounded by blue lines or the grid edge.
  - name: yellow_regions
    type: area
    description: Regions filled with yellow (4) pixels, bounded by blue lines and/or green regions, or by two or more sides of the grid.
  - name: black_regions
    type: area
    description: Initial regions of black (0) that get filled with either green or yellow.

actions:
  - name: flood_fill_green
    description: Fill black regions with green, stopping at blue lines or grid edges.
  - name: flood_fill_yellow
    description: Fill remaining black regions with yellow, stopping at blue lines, green regions, or at least two grid edges.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Boundaries:** Locate all blue (1) pixels that form continuous horizontal and vertical lines. These lines serve as boundaries for the filling process.

2.  **Flood Fill with Green (3):** Starting from any black (0) pixel, change its color to green (3). Continue expanding this green region in all four directions (up, down, left, right) until a blue (1) pixel line or the edge of the grid is encountered. Repeat this for all disconnected black regions until no more black pixels can be filled with green.

3.  **Flood Fill with Yellow (4):** Starting from any remaining black (0) pixel, change its color to yellow (4). Continue expanding in all four directions until any of the following is encountered:
    *   A blue (1) pixel.
    *   A green (3) pixel.
    *   Two edges of the grid (e.g. a corner or a black region adjacent to two non-connected edges)

4. Repeat step 3 until there are no more black pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
