The input grids appear to have a pattern of lines forming a shape, predominantly using one color, against a background of another color. The output grids seem to modify the colors within the shape, sometimes introducing new colors, and inverting the colors in specific crossing. The overall shape defined by the non-background pixels appears to be mostly preserved, with changes primarily focused on color assignments. There appear to be different \"layers\" of crossing, using different colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
