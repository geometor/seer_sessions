There are distinct horizontal and vertical lines of 9s.\n*   **Output:** A very similar grid, but with some 0s replaced by 4s (yellow) and some 9s by 3s(green). The changes seem to be related to the positions of the maroon lines. The areas enclosed by maroon pixels are filled. The filling alternates between yellow and green as we move from left to right and up to down.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
