Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Find all pixels with the value 8 (azure) in the input grid.

2.  **Check for 2x2 Square Formation:** For each azure pixel, examine the three other pixels that could potentially form a 2x2 square with it. These are the pixels diagonally, above/below, and to the left/right.

3.  **Conditional Blue Pixel Addition:** Add a blue pixel (value 1) *only* if *all* of the following conditions are met:
    *   The potential 2x2 square lies entirely within the grid boundaries.
    *   The three examined pixels are *exclusively* colors 1 (blue) or 8 (azure).
    *   The blue pixel is placed at the diagonally opposite position to the selected azure pixel.

4.  **One Blue per Azure:** Only one blue pixel may be added per azure pixel considered.

5.  **Output:** The modified grid with the added blue pixels (if any) is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
