The input grid contains a shape formed by the digit '5' (gray) on a background of '0' (white). The output grid seems to maintain the overall shape and position, but with different digits.  Specifically, the leftmost part of the '5' shape is replaced with '2' (red), and the rightmost part is replaced with '8' (azure). The background remains '0' (white). The transformation appears to be a color substitution based on the relative horizontal position within the initial shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
