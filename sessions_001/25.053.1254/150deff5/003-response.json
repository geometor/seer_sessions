            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a good first attempt, correctly identifying the gray object and attempting to segment it based on the average x-coordinate. However, the segmentation logic is flawed, leading to incorrect coloring in all three test cases. The core issue is the inconsistent application of the \"left\" and \"right\" division relative to the average x-coordinate. The code sometimes colors correctly but seems to get the sides reversed occasionally, and sometimes gets the split point wrong.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the segmentation logic. We need to ensure a consistent and accurate method for splitting the gray object based on its spatial properties. Instead of only using a single average x-coordinate of the entire shape to perform the segmentation, calculate the average x-coordinate of the grey pixels of each row, and, use it as a criterion to recolor grey pixels in its row.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a summary of each example, with added analysis, and the code results\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n-   **Input:** A complex gray shape.\n-   **Expected Output:** The shape is split, roughly vertically, with the left portion azure and the right portion red.\n-   **Actual Output:** Mix up between red and azure pixels\n- **Error Analysis:** errors in splitting by rows\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n-   **Input:** Another complex gray shape.\n-   **Expected Output:**  Similar vertical split, left azure, right red.\n-   **Actual Output:** Mix up between red and azure pixels\n-   **Error Analysis:** errors in splitting by rows\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n-   **Input:** Yet another complex gray shape.\n-   **Expected Output:**  Similar vertical split, but this time is clear that split happens by row.\n-   **Actual Output:** Mix up between red and azure pixels\n-   **Error Analysis:** errors in splitting by rows\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 002-py_01\nfacts:\n  - observation: \"The input grids contain a single object composed of gray (5) pixels on a black (0) background.\"\n  - object: \"Gray object\"\n    properties:\n      color: \"gray (5)\"\n      shape: \"Irregular, contiguous block of pixels\"\n  - action: \"Segmentation\"\n    description: \"The gray object is divided into two regions based on spatial properties.\"\n    criteria: \"The average x-coordinate of gray pixels of each row.\"\n    result:\n      - region_1:\n          pixels: \"Gray pixels to the left of average x-coordinate of the row.\"\n          color: \"azure (8)\"\n      - region_2:\n          pixels: \"Gray pixels to the right of average x-coordinate of the row.\"\n          color: \"red (2)\"\n  - background:\n      color: \"black (0)\"\n      action: \"Preserved, remains unchanged in the output.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Input Object:** Find all pixels with a value of gray (5) within the input grid. These pixels form a single contiguous object.\n\n2.  **Segment by Row:** For each row of the grid, calculate the average x-coordinate of the gray pixels that compose the input object present on the row.\n    *   Consider gray pixels to the left or at the same horizontal position as the average x coordinate calculated before\n    *   Consider grey pixels to the right of the average x coordinate calculated before\n\n3.  **Recolor:**\n    *   Change the color of grey pixels that form region 1 to azure (8).\n    *   Change the color of grey pixels that form region 2 to red (2).\n\n4.  **Preserve Background:** All other pixels in the grid (the background) retain their original colors. This is implicitly handled by starting with a copy of the input grid.\n"
