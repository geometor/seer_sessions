The most obvious change is the rearrangement of non-zero elements.  Zero-valued cells (white pixels) seem to act as \"empty\" space. The non-zero values appear to be preserved, but their positions change. The transformation doesn't seem to involve any arithmetic operations on the values themselves. It is a positional, or geometric operation. It appears that the non zero numbers are being moved to the bottom.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
