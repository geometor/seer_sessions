# Example

**input:**
```
0 4 0 9
0 0 0 0
0 4 6 0
1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7C6B13178460>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 4 0 0
1 4 6 9
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 4x4 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 4x4 grid. The most obvious change is the rearrangement of non-zero elements.  Zero-valued cells (white pixels) seem to act as "empty" space. The non-zero values appear to be preserved, but their positions change. The transformation doesn't seem to involve any arithmetic operations on the values themselves. It is a positional, or geometric operation. It appears that the non zero numbers are being moved to the bottom.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_type: pixel
    color_map:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
        3: green
        4: yellow
        5: gray
        6: magenta
        7: orange
        8: azure
        9: maroon

properties:
  - property: position
    description: row and column index of a pixel within the grid
  - property: color
    description: integer value representing the color of a pixel

actions:
  - action: move
    description: change the position of non-zero pixels

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid, establishing row and column relationships
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero value.
2.  **Order Non Zero Pixels**: Extract and maintain a list of the non-zero integers, preserving original order from left to right and top to bottom reading of input
3. **Clear the Grid**: set all values in a new 4x4 grid to zero
4.  **Fill last row:** Place the ordered non-zero pixels into the last row of the output grid, starting from the bottom-leftmost cell and filling to the right. Any cells in the bottom row of output grid that do not contain one of the original input grid's non-zero pixels will be zero.
5. All other cells are zero

In more concise terms, the transformation moves all non-zero pixels to the last row of the output grid, preserving their original order, and fills the rest of the grid with zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
