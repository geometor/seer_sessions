The input grid appears to be larger (7x3) than the output grid (3x3). Specific colors seem to play a crucial role: white (0), blue (1), and gray (5) in the input, and white (0) and red (2) in the output. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple sub-region extraction, as the relative positions of colors change. The gray (5) column in the input is not present at all. It appears there is a direct relationship with the location of the blue (1) to the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Other color are irrelevant. The core transformation maps each blue (1) pixel from the input to a red (2) pixel in the corresponding index divided by 2 in the output. Gray (5) pixels are discarded, and white (0) remains as white (0).\n"
