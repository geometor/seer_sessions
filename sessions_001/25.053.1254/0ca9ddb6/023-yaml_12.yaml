objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8]  # Colors present in inputs/outputs
      seed_colors: [1, 2, 6, 8]   # Colors that initiate a transformation
      expansion_colors: {1: 7, 2: 4}  # Mapping of seed color to expansion color
      expansion_directions:
        1: [down, left, right]  # Blue expands to Orange in these directions
        2: [up, left, right]    # Red expands to Yellow in these directions
        6: []  # stays
        8: []  # Stays
      constraints: [expands_onto_white_only] #pixel can only expand where an existing white(0) pixel exists.
actions:
  - name: expand_seed_pixels
    description: Seed pixels initiate color expansions based on their color.
  - name: iterative_expansion
    description: Newly added expansion colors continue to expand, one layer at a time, but ONLY onto white(0).
