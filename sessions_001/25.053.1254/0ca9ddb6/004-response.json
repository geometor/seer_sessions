            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the results of the attempted transformations, along with a strategy for improving the natural language program and, consequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial attempts show a misunderstanding of the transformation. The provided `transformed_` arrays are not the result of any consistent rule related to the input and expected output. The core issue is that the attempted transformations are based on creating 3x3 blocks, while the actual transformations involve a more complex interaction between colored pixels.\n\nThe strategy should involve these steps:\n\n1.  **Accurate Observation:** Carefully observe input, expected, and transformed data from the prior attempt.\n2.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Determine which pixels in the input are crucial for the transformation.  In all examples, it appears the presence of red (2) and blue (1) pixels trigger changes, and other non-black colors seem involved as well.\n3.  **Hypothesize Transformation Rule:** Formulate a hypothesis about how these key pixels interact to produce the output.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the hypothesis, compare it with the `expected_` outputs, and refine the hypothesis and natural language program based on discrepancies.\n5. Use the yellow (4) and orange (7) as markers\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution Results Analysis)**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example Input/Output Data (as numpy arrays)\n\n# --- Example 1\ninput_1 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\nexpected_1 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\ntransformed_1 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\n# --- Example 2\ninput_2 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\nexpected_2 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 7, 1, 7, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n    [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 7, 1, 7, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n    [4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\ntransformed_2 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n    [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n    [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n    [0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\n# --- Example 3\ninput_3 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\nexpected_3 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 7, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\ntransformed_3 = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\ndef find_pixel(grid, color):\n    coords = np.where(grid == color)\n    if len(coords[0]) > 0:\n        return (coords[0][0], coords[1][0])\n    return None\n\ndef pixel_counts(grid):\n    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    return dict(zip(unique, counts))\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, expected_grid, transformed_grid, example_num):\n    print(f\"Example {example_num}:\")\n    print(\"  Red Pixel Location (Input):\", find_pixel(input_grid, 2))\n    print(\"  Blue Pixel Location (Input):\", find_pixel(input_grid, 1))\n    print(\"  Yellow Pixel Location (Input):\", find_pixel(input_grid, 4))\n    print(\"  Orange Pixel Location (Input):\", find_pixel(input_grid, 7))\n    print(\"  Expected pixel counts\", pixel_counts(expected_grid))\n    print(\"  Transformed pixel counts\", pixel_counts(transformed_grid))\n    # Check for added or missing colors\n    expected_colors = set(np.unique(expected_grid))\n    transformed_colors = set(np.unique(transformed_grid))\n    print(\"Colors in expected but not transformed:\", expected_colors -
