These are the \"key\" pixels.\n3.  **Azure (8) Rule:**\n    *   For each key pixel that is azure (color 8), examine its *adjacent*\n        neighbors. Adjacent means directly above, below, left, or right (not\n        diagonal).\n    *   If an adjacent neighbor is white (color 0), change its color to orange\n        (color 7).\n4.  **Red (2) and Blue (1) Rule:**\n    *   For each key pixel that is red (color 2) or blue (color 1), examine\n        pixels that are exactly at an L1 distance of 2.  This means two steps\n        away, counting only horizontal and vertical steps, not diagonal.\n    *   If a pixel at L1 distance of 2 is white (color 0), change its color to\n        yellow (color 4).\n5.  **Magenta (6) Exception:** Key pixels that are magenta (color 6) do *not*\n    cause any color changes in other pixels.\n6.  **Application of Changes:** The key idea is to apply color based on the\n    *input* grid's state, updating the *output* grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col, distance=1):\n    \"\"\"Gets the neighbors of a cell within a specified L1 distance.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for i in range(max(0, row - distance), min(rows, row + distance + 1)):\n        for j in range(max(0, col - distance), min(cols, col + distance + 1)):\n            if (abs(row - i) + abs(col - j)) == distance and (row, col) != (i,j):\n                neighbors.append((i, j))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Identify Key Pixels and Target Pixels, and store changes\n    changes = []  # List to store (row, col, new_color) tuples\n    key_pixels = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i, j] != 0:\n                key_pixels.append((i, j, input_grid[i, j]))\n\n    # Determine Changes\n    for r, c, color in key_pixels:\n        # Azure (8) Rule\n        if color == 8:\n             neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c, distance=1) # adjacent\n             for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                if input_grid[nr, nc] == 0:  # Check if white\n                    changes.append((nr, nc, 7))   # Change to orange\n\n        # Red (2) and Blue (1) Rule\n        elif color == 1 or color == 2:\n            neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c, distance=2) # L1=2\n            for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                if input_grid[nr, nc] == 0:   # Check if white\n                    changes.append((nr, nc, 4))    # Change to Yellow\n\n        # Magenta (6) behavior - no change\n        elif color == 6:\n            pass  # Do nothing.\n\n    # Apply changes\n    for r, c, new_color in changes:\n        output_grid[r, c] = new_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
