These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n\n2.  **Initial Expansion (Seed Pixel Rules):**\n    *   If a seed pixel is Blue (1): Add Orange (7) pixels to its immediate left, right, and below positions, *but only if* those positions are currently White (0) in the *output* grid.\n    *   If a seed pixel is Red (2): Add Yellow (4) pixels to its immediate top, left, and right positions, *but only if* those positions are currently White (0) in the *output* grid.\n    *   If a seed pixel is Magenta (6) or Azure (8): Do nothing.\n\n3.  **Iterative Expansion (Layer-by-Layer):**\n    *   **Step 1:** Consider *only* the Orange (7) and Yellow (4) pixels added in the *Initial Expansion*.\n        * If an added pixel is Orange (7): add an Orange(7) pixel to its immediate left, right and below, *but only if* those positions are currently White(0) in the output grid.\n        * If an added pixel is Yellow(4): add an Yellow(4) pixel to its immediate top, left, and right, *but only if* those positions are currently white(0) in the output grid.\n    *  **Step 2 and beyond:** Repeat Step 1, but for each iteration, *only* consider the colored pixels added in the *immediately preceding* step. Continue until no new pixels are added.\n\n4.  **Expansion Constraints:**\n    *   New pixels can only be added to positions that are currently White (0) in the output grid.\n    *   Colors *never* expand onto other non-white colors, whether those colors are from the original input or added during expansion.\n\n5. **Preservation:**\n  * White (0) pixels not modified remain white(0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_seed_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds all non-zero pixels and returns their coordinates and values.\"\"\"\n    seed_pixels = []\n    for r, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for c, value in enumerate(row):\n            if value != 0:\n                seed_pixels.append(((r, c), value))\n    return seed_pixels\n\ndef expand_around_pixel(grid, row, col, color, directions):\n    \"\"\"Expands around a given pixel with the specified color in the given directions.\"\"\"\n    new_pixels = []\n    for dr, dc in directions:\n        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1] and grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n            grid[nr, nc] = color\n            new_pixels.append(((nr, nc), color))\n    return new_pixels\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    seed_pixels = get_seed_pixels(input_grid)\n\n    # Initial Expansion (Seed Pixel Rules)\n    new_pixels = []\n    for (row, col), value in seed_pixels:\n        if value == 1:  # Blue\n            new_pixels.extend(expand_around_pixel(output_grid, row, col, 7, [(0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0)]))\n        elif value == 2:  # Red\n            new_pixels.extend(expand_around_pixel(output_grid, row, col, 4, [(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]))\n        # Magenta (6) and Azure (8) do nothing\n\n    # Iterative Expansion (Layer-by-Layer)\n    while new_pixels:\n        next_new_pixels = []\n        for (row, col), value in new_pixels:\n            if value == 7:  # Orange\n                next_new_pixels.extend(expand_around_pixel(output_grid, row, col, 7, [(0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 0)]))\n            elif value == 4:  # Yellow\n                next_new_pixels.extend(expand_around_pixel(output_grid, row, col, 4, [(-1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]))\n        new_pixels = next_new_pixels\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
