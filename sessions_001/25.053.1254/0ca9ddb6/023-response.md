Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy of identifying "seed" pixels and expanding them based on color-specific rules has merit. However, the iterative expansion logic is flawed. It appears to be adding pixels in all allowed directions *simultaneously* during the iteration on `new_pixels`, rather than in a truly iterative, layer-by-layer fashion, causing "bleeding" of colors beyond what the outputs intend. Specifically, the transformed output grows colors around the entire perimeter of newly placed colors in a single pass, instead of a staged expansion.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Iterative Expansion:** The core issue is the way the `new_pixels` are handled. The iterative expansion should happen in distinct steps. After placing the initial extensions around the seed pixels, we need to treat *only* those new pixels as seeds for the *next* step. This prevents "over-expansion" in a single iteration. We need to iterate on the newly added colors only and not extend based on the input colors.

2.  **Refine Neighbor Selection:** Verify neighbors should ensure that expansion occurs only on to white pixels.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has seed pixels: Red (2) and Blue (1).
    *   Expected output shows a limited expansion of Yellow (4) around Red and Orange (7) around Blue.
    *   Transformed output shows excessive expansion, particularly around the initial extensions.
    *   Errors: "Bleeding" of colors. The extension is occurring in single passes, not iteratively building out.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has seed pixels: Azure (8), Red (2), Blue (1), and Blue(1).
    *   Expected output: Azure(8) does not expand, Red(2) expands up left, and right with Yellow, Blue expands down, left, right with orange(7)
    *   Transformed output: Shows interaction errors. The colors are expanding too aggressively again.
    *    Errors: "Bleeding", colors expanding onto non-white areas.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has seed pixels: Red(2), Magenta(6) and Blue(1)
    *   Expected output: Red(2) exapnds as expected, Magenta(6) no change as expected. Blue(1) limited extension
    *   Transformed output: Magenta has no change as expected but Red and Blue expanding too far
    *   Errors: "Bleeding" of the Red/Yellow and Blue/Orange expansion

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all non-white (non-0) pixels in the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels.

2.  **Initial Expansion (Seed Pixel Rules):**
    *   If a seed pixel is Blue (1): Add Orange (7) pixels to its immediate left, right, and below positions, *but only if* those positions are currently White (0) in the *output* grid.
    *   If a seed pixel is Red (2): Add Yellow (4) pixels to its immediate top, left, and right positions, *but only if* those positions are currently White (0) in the *output* grid.
    *   If a seed pixel is Magenta (6) or Azure (8): Do nothing.

3.  **Iterative Expansion (Layer-by-Layer):**
    *   **Step 1:** Consider *only* the Orange (7) and Yellow(4) pixels added in the *Initial Expansion*.
        * If an added pixel is Orange (7): add an Orange(7) pixel to its immediate left, right and below, *but only if* those positions are currently White(0) in the output grid.
        * If an added pixel is Yellow(4): add an Yellow(4) pixel to its immediate top, left, and right, *but only if* those positions are currently white(0) in the output grid.
    *  **Step 2 and beyond:** Repeat Step 1, but for each iteration, *only* consider the colored pixels added in the *immediately preceding* step. Continue until no new pixels are added.

4.  **Expansion Constraints:**
    *   New pixels can only be added to positions that are currently White (0) in the output grid.
    *   Colors *never* expand onto other non-white colors, whether those colors are from the original input or added during expansion.

5. **Preservation:**
  * White (0) pixels not modified remain white(0).
