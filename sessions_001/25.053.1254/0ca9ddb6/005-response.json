            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a reasonable starting point, focusing on identifying the locations of specific colored pixels (red, blue, yellow, orange). However, it's clear from the `transformed_` outputs that this is *not* the core transformation. The `transformed_` grids show significant changes (expansions of certain colors) that the initial logic doesn't account for. The `expected_` grids have cross patterns inserted at different locations, apparently guided by colored pixels in the input, but also including other colors that weren't in the input (e.g., yellow/4 and orange/7).  The simple location-finding isn't sufficient. We need to shift our focus to understanding how the colored pixels in the input guide the creation of the cross-like structures and color additions in the `expected` output.  The key is to relate the INPUT to the EXPECTED output. The `transformed` grids, which have large same color blocks, are a distraction and a misinterpretation of the task.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Input and Expected:** Ignore the `transformed_` outputs for now. They are based on a flawed initial hypothesis. Concentrate on the relationship between `input_` and `expected_` grids.\n\n2.  **Identify Cross Centers:** The \"cross\" patterns in the `expected_` outputs seem crucial. Determine the rule that places the center of these crosses. It's likely related to the positions of colored pixels in the `input_` grids.\n\n3.  **Determine Cross Colors:**  Once the center is located, analyze the logic that determines the colors used in the horizontal and vertical arms of the crosses.  There might be a consistent pattern related to input pixel colors or a fixed color sequence.\n\n4.  **YAML for Object Properties:**  Create a YAML structure that clearly defines:\n    *   **Objects:**  The colored pixels in the input (red, blue, etc.) and the crosses in the output.\n    *   **Properties:**  Location (row, column), color.\n    *   **Actions:**  \"Creates cross at location...\", \"Uses color...\"\n\n5.  **Natural Language Program:** Develop a step-by-step program that describes how the input is processed to generate the output:\n    *   Find specific colored pixels.\n    *   Based on those locations, determine the center of crosses.\n    *   Construct the crosses using specific colors.\n\n**Metrics and Reports (from provided code output):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Red Pixel Location (Input): (2, 2)\n    *   Blue Pixel Location (Input): (6, 6)\n    *   Yellow Pixel Location (Input): None\n    *   Orange Pixel Location (Input): None\n    *   Expected pixel counts: {0: 73, 1: 1, 2: 1, 4: 4, 7: 4}\n    *    Transformed pixel counts: {0: 56, 4: 9, 7: 9}\n    *    Colors in expected but not transformed: {1, 2}\n    *    Colors in transformed but not expected: set()\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Red Pixel Location (Input): (7, 1)\n    *   Blue Pixel Location (Input): (3, 2), (6,6)\n    *   Yellow Pixel Location (Input): None\n    *   Orange Pixel Location (Input): None\n    *    Expected pixel counts {0: 59, 1: 1, 2: 1, 4: 8, 7: 8, 8:1}\n    *    Transformed pixel counts {0: 62, 1: 1, 2: 1, 4:9, 7:9, 8:1}\n    *  Colors in expected but not transformed: set()\n    *  Colors in transformed but not expected: set()\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Red Pixel Location (Input): (2, 2)\n    *   Blue Pixel Location (Input): (7, 3)\n    *   Yellow Pixel Location (Input): None\n    *   Orange Pixel Location (Input): None\n    *   Expected pixel counts: {0: 73, 1: 1, 2: 1, 4: 4, 6: 1, 7: 4}\n    *   Transformed pixel counts: {0: 62, 4: 9, 6:1, 7:9}\n    *  Colors in expected but not transformed: {1,2}\n    *   Colors in transformed but not expected: set()\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: input_pixel\n    properties:\n      - color: red (2)\n        locations:\n          - example1: [2, 2]\n          - example2: [7, 1]\n          - example3: [2, 2]\n      - color: blue (1)\n        locations:\n          - example1: [6, 6]\n          - example2: [3, 2], [6, 6]\n          - example3: [7, 3]\n      - color: azure (8)\n        locations:\n          - example2: [0,3]\n      - color: magenta (6)\n        locations:\n          - example3: [5,6]\n  - type: output_cross\n    properties:\n      - colors: [yellow (4), orange (7)]\n        centers: #Determined by location of input pixels.\n          - example1:\n            - yellow: [2,1], [2,3]  # Based on Red.\n            - orange: [6,5], [6,7] # Based on Blue.\n          - example2:\n            - yellow: [1,5], [1,7], [7, 5], [7,7]\n            - orange: [3,1], [3,3]\n          - example3:\n            - yellow: [1,1], [1,3]  # Based on Red\n            - orange: [7,2] # Based on blue\n\nactions:\n  - description: \"Input pixels of color red and blue determine the placement of output crosses.\"\n  - description: \"Crosses have horizontal and vertical lines using yellow(4) and orange(7) in a repeated pattern, and intersecting input color\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Key Pixels:** Locate all red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n2. **Input color location as cross intersection** If a red pixel is found, insert a yellow cross. The red pixel becomes the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical line.\n3.  **Create Yellow Cross:** a. If there isn't a horizontal row of yellow color in the output, insert a row of yellow at the index = input red pixel row index - 1; b. insert yellow color at the columns = input red pixel column index -1 and column index + 1\n4.  **Find Key Pixels:** Locate all blue(1) pixels in the input grid.\n5. **Create Orange Cross:** If a blue pixel is found, insert an orange cross. The blue pixel becomes the intersection of a horizontal and a vertical line.\n6.  **Create Orange Cross:** a. If there isn't a horizontal row of orange color in the output, insert a row of orange at the index = input blue pixel row index + 1; b. insert orange color at the columns = input blue pixel column index -1 and column index + 1\n\nThe core idea is that red and blue pixels \"seed\" the creation of yellow and orange crosses, respectively.  The placement of the crosses is directly tied to the row/column of the seeding pixels.\n"
