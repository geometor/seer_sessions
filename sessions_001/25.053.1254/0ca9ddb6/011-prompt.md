1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "key pixels".

2.  **Orange Expansion (Azure):**  For the azure pixel (8), change the color to orange (7) of *all* the white pixels that immediately *surround* it, horizontally and vertically.

3.  **Yellow Expansion (Red and Blue):** For red (2) and blue (1) pixels, we replace every white pixel that is at L1 distance = 2 with a yellow pixel (4). L1 distance (Manhattan distance) of two indicates pixels that have a difference of two in either row or column, or one in both.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
