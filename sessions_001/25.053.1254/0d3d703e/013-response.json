            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple one-to-one color mapping, likely derived from the first training example. However, the subsequent tests reveal that this mapping isn't universally correct for all colors across all examples. Some colors are correctly mapped, while others are not. The `6` and `9` is consistently mapped. The strategy should involve refining the color mapping to ensure it accurately reflects the transformations observed in *all* training examples, not just the first.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each input/output/transformed output triplet. Identify which color mappings are consistent across all examples and which ones are inconsistent.\n2.  **Refine Mapping:** Create a revised color mapping that correctly accounts for all observed transformations. It may involve:\n    *   Adding new mappings.\n    *   Modifying existing mappings.\n    *   Leaving some color as original color\n3.  **Test Thoroughly:** Re-run the `transform` function with the updated mapping against all training examples to confirm its accuracy.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of each example, including specific observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `4 1 6`\n    *   Expected: `4 5 6`\n    *   Observed: `3 5 2`\n    *   Correct Mappings: `1 -> 5`\n    *   Incorrect Mappings: `4 -> 3` (should be `4`), `6 -> 2` (should be 6)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `6 4 9`\n    *   Expected: `6 4 9`\n    *   Observed: `2 3 8`\n    *   Correct Mappings: None.\n    *   Incorrect Mappings: `6 -> 2` (should be `6`), `4 -> 3` (should be 4), `9 -> 8` (should be 9)\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `5 9 6`\n    *   Expected: `1 9 2`\n    *   Observed: `1 8 2`\n    *   Correct Mappings: `5 -> 1`, `6->2`\n    *   Incorrect Mappings: `9 -> 8` (should be 9)\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `9 4 6`\n    *   Expected: `8 3 6`\n    *   Observed: `8 3 2`\n    *   Correct Mappings: `9 -> 8`\n    *   Incorrect Mappings: `4 -> 3` (should be 3), `6->2` (should be 6)\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: Each input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions.\n  - observation: The transformation involves changing some of the pixel colors based on a one-to-one mapping.\n  - observation: Not all colors are changed; some may remain the same.\n  - object: color_mapping\n    properties:\n      type: dictionary\n      description: Maps input pixel values (colors) to output pixel values.\n      initial_mapping: {1: 5, 2: 6, 3: 4, 4: 3, 5: 1, 6: 2, 8: 9, 9: 8}\n      revised_mapping: {1:5, 6:6, 4:4, 5:1, 9:9}\n      notes: >\n       It maps correctly for color 1 and 5, but incorrect for colors 4 and 6, and 9.\n       Revised_mapping is hypothesized based on current and old data.\n  - action: apply_mapping\n    description: Iterates through each pixel of the input grid and applies the color mapping to generate the output grid.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Create, or maintain, a color mapping, where some colors should stay and the others should change. Based on the testing, colors could have the following mapping:\n    *   1 -> 5\n    *   4 -> 4\n    *   5 -> 1\n    *   6 -> 6\n    *   9 -> 9\n3.  **Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid:\n    *   If the pixel's color is a key in the color mapping, change the pixel's color in the output grid to the corresponding value in the mapping.\n    *.  If the pixel color is not in the mapping dictionary, then keep original color.\n4.  **Output:** The result is the modified grid (output grid).\n"
