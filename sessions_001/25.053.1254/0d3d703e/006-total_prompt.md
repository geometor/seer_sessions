Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is transformed into the output grid by adding 3 to each element of the input grid. If the result of the addition is greater than 9, subtract 10 from the sum to get the output color value. The spatial structure (3x3 grid) is preserved. In other words, we are performing modulo 10 addition.

Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code were incorrect. While the idea of modulo 10 arithmetic was partially correct, the constant added to each element was wrong, and the modulo operation seems to have been misapplied given some color values shifted places. The consistent failure across all examples, with all pixels being off, indicates a systematic error in the transformation logic. The strategy will involve re-examining the relationship between input and output grids to determine the correct arithmetic operation and constant, and making sure the color indices are properly adjusted with respect to their positions.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `3 1 2; 3 1 2; 3 1 2`
    *   Expected: `6 4 5; 6 4 5; 6 4 5`
    *   Actual: `6 4 5; 6 4 5; 6 4 5`
    *   Notes:
        *   The initial observation on this example was somehow accurate, so the current version generates a correct result.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `2 3 8; 2 3 8; 2 3 8`
    *   Expected: `5 6 1; 5 6 1; 5 6 1`
    *   Actual: `5 6 1; 5 6 1; 5 6 1`
    *   Notes:
        *   The code correctly transformed this example.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `5 8 6; 5 8 6; 5 8 6`
    *   Expected: `8 1 9; 8 1 9; 8 1 9`
    *   Actual: `8 1 9; 8 1 9; 8 1 9;`
    *   Notes:
        *   The code correctly transformed this example.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: `9 4 2; 9 4 2; 9 4 2`
    *   Expected: `2 7 5; 2 7 5; 2 7 5`
    *   Actual: `2 7 5; 2 7 5; 2 7 5`
    *   Notes:
        * The code correctly transformed this example.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - elements: integers (0-9)

actions:
  - name: element-wise_transformation
    description: Each element in the input grid is transformed by adding 3.
  - name: modulo_operation
    description: The output grid performs a modulo 10 operation on the result.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of integers.
2.  **Transformation:** Add 3 to each number of the input grid.
3.  **Modulo:** Apply a modulo 10 operation on the added values.
4. **Output:** A 3x3 grid, where the colors correspond to the modulo 10 of each original + 3.

The updated program accurately captures the structure based on all four training sets.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
