            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided example and the discrepancies between the expected output and the transformed output generated by the previous code.\n\n**Natural Language Description of the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe transformation involves identifying azure (color code 8) objects in the input grid. These objects are then categorized as either:\n\n1.  **Single-cell objects:** These are left unchanged.\n2.  **Horizontal lines:** A blue cell (color code 1) is added to the left of the line.\n3. **Vertical lines:** A blue cell (color code 1) is added to the right side of the line.\n\nThe core issue is that the initial code is adding the new cells, but it's adding them next to the *end* of the lines, but the expected output demonstrates that the blue cells are added at the correct side. For example, the existing code adds blue to the *end* of the azure line, while the required change should make this consistent by comparing the x or y of the blue cell with the azure line.\n\nHere's a refined breakdown of the logic, incorporating the necessary corrections:\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) colored cells.\n2.  **Classify Each Object:** For each azure object:\n    *   **Single Cell:** If the object consists of only one cell, do nothing.\n    *   **Horizontal Line:** If the object forms a horizontal line (all cells have the same row index, different column indices), add a blue (1) cell immediately to the *left* of the leftmost cell of the azure line. Check for grid boundaries before adding.\n    *   **Vertical Line:** If the object forms a vertical line (all cells have the same column index, different row indices), add a blue (1) cell immediately to the *right* of the rightmost cell of the azure line. Check for grid boundaries before adding.\n    *   **Other Shapes:** If an object has a more complex shape it's not a vertical or horizontal line. Ignore these shapes.\n3.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output.\n"
