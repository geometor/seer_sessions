            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in the second example.\n\n**Observations and Documentation**\n\nHere's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:\n\n```yaml\ntask: 005\ninput_grid:\n  size: 3x3\n  objects:\n    - color: 2 (red)\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]\n    - color: 3 (green)\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]\n    - color: 8 (azure)\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]\noutput_grid:\n  size: 3x3\n  objects:\n    - color: 6 (magenta)\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      positions: [0,0], [1,0], [2,0]\n    - color: 4 (yellow)\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      positions: [0,1], [1,1], [2,1]\n    - color: 9 (maroon)\n      count: 3\n      shape: vertical line\n      positions: [0,2], [1,2], [2,2]\n\n```\n\n**Determining the Transformation Rule**\n\nSimilar to the first example, the input grid consists of three vertical lines of different colors (red, green, and azure). The output grid shows a similar structure but with different colors (magenta, yellow, and maroon). The transformation appears to be another color substitution:\n\n-   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).\n-   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).\n-   Azure (8) is transformed to Maroon (9).\n\nThis transformation rule, however, is not simple as adding one to the value. It maintains the shape and position of the objects, but the color mapping is different: +4, +1, +1.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n2.  For each cell, identify its color.\n3. Apply the following color changes:\n    -   If the color is Red (2), change it to Magenta (6).\n    -   If the color is Green (3), change it to Yellow (4).\n    -   If the color is Azure (8), change it to Maroon (9).\n4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is a color substitution: each color in the input grid is mapped to a new color in the output grid according to the following rule:\n- Red (2) -> Magenta (6)\n- Green (3) -> Yellow (4)\n- Azure (8) -> Maroon (9)\nThe structure of the grid remains identical.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid into the output grid by applying a color substitution.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid (numpy.ndarray): The input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        numpy.ndarray: The transformed output grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n            # Get the color of the current cell.\n            input_color = input_grid[i, j]\n\n            # Apply the color substitution.\n            if input_color == 2:\n                output_color = 6\n            elif input_color == 3:\n                output_color = 4\n            elif input_color == 8:\n                output_color = 9\n            else:\n                output_color = input_color # added to ensure the function completes for any color\n\n            # Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.\n            output_grid[i, j] = output_color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
