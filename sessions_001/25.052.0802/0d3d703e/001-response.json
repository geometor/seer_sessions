The output grid shows a similar structure but with different colors (yellow, gray, and magenta). Each color in the input is consistently mapped to a different color in the output:\n\n-   Green (3) is transformed to Yellow (4).\n-   Blue (1) is transformed to Gray (5).\n-   Red (2) is transformed to Magenta (6).\n\nThe transformation rule can be described as a simple color substitution, maintaining the shape and position of the objects while adding 1 to the object id (color) in the input data.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  Iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n2.  For each cell, identify its color.\n3.  Increase the color value, obtaining the new color for the output\n4.  Place the new color in the corresponding cell of the output grid.\n\n"
