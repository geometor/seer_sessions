The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify the vertical line of color 5 in the input grid.
2. Create a 3x3 output grid filled with color 0.
3. Change the color of the central cell of the identified vertical line of 5 from 5 to 2 and place it in the center of the output grid.
4. All other cells in the output grid remain color 0.

Train Set Results:

**Example 1:**
Input:
```
0 0 1 5 0 0 0
1 1 0 5 1 0 1
0 1 1 5 1 0 1
```
Expected Output:
```
0 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 2
```
Transformed Output:
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

Status: False

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
