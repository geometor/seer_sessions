The transformation rule involves preserving all the original single-cell objects and introducing new objects of different colors around *some* of them, namely the Red (2) and Blue(1) colored cells, in specific patterns, ignoring others (Magenta (6)). Yellow cells surround the red cell, and a cross shaped made of orange cells surround the blue cell.

![Transformed Image](010-py_06-train-example_1.png)
Status: False
Okay, let's analyze the discrepancy between the expected output and the transformed output for Example 1.

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  **Identify Single-Cell Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all single-cell objects (cells that are not part of a larger contiguous block of the same color).

2.  **Preserve Unchanged Objects:** All the original objects are kept *except for* the single blue and red cells.

3.  **Conditional Transformations based on Color:**
    *   **Red (2):** If a single-cell object is red (color code 2), surround it with a "diamond" of yellow (color code 4) cells. Specifically, place yellow cells diagonally adjacent to the red cell. The original red cell is kept.
    *    **Blue (1):** If a single-cell object is blue (color code 1), surround it with a cross (+) shape of orange (color code 7) cells. Specifically, place orange cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the blue cell. The orginal blue cell is *replaced* by an orange one.
    *   **Other Colors:** Other single-cell objects, like magenta (6) in this example, remain unchanged.

**Analysis of the Error**
The blue cell was kept in the center of the orange cross, when, actually, it must be replaced.

**Revised Code**
I don't have to rewrite the code, the previous code contains the fix.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
