One cell up, down, left and right.\n\n4.  **Background:** All other cells in the grid remain unchanged (color 0).\n\n**Summary of the rule**\n\nThe transformation rule involves preserving the original single-cell objects (colors 8, 2, and 1) and introducing new objects of different colors around the 2 and 1 colored cells, in specific patterns, taking boundaries into account. Yellow cells surround the red cells, and a cross shaped made of orange cells surround the blue cells.\n"
