Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n2.  For each column, find the bottom-most non-white cell.\n3.  Move each of those cells to the last row of the output grid, maintaining the original column.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n2. For each column, find the bottom-most non-white cell.\n3. Move each of those cells to the last row of the output grid, maintaining the original column.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving the bottom-most non-white cell in each column\n    to the last row, maintaining their original column order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as all zeros (white).\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n    for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n        # Find the bottom-most non-white cell in the current column.\n        for i in reversed(range(input_grid.shape[0])):\n            if input_grid[i, j] != 0:\n                # Place the color of the bottom-most non-white cell in the last row of the output grid.\n                output_grid[-1, j] = input_grid[i, j]\n                break  # Stop after finding the first non-white cell from the bottom\n\n    #Copy the last row from the input to the output\n    output_grid[-1,:] = input_grid[-1,:]\n\n    #Add elements from the next to last row\n    for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n      if input_grid[-2,j] != 0:\n        output_grid[-2,j] = input_grid[-2,j]\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
