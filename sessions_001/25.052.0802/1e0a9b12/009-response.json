Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n2.  For each column, identify the non-white cells from bottom to top.\n3. Starting from the last row and moving upward, move these cells to the output grid maintaining their relative vertical order within the column.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n1. Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n2. For each column, identify the non-white cells from bottom to top.\n3. Starting from the last row and moving upwards, move these cells to the output grid\n   maintaining their relative vertical order within the column.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by moving the non-white cells in each column\n    to the bottom of the output grid, maintaining their original column and\n    relative vertical order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as all zeros (white).\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Iterate through each column of the input grid.\n    for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):\n        # Collect non-white cells from the current column, from bottom to top.\n        non_white_cells = []\n        for i in reversed(range(input_grid.shape[0])):\n            if input_grid[i, j] != 0:\n                non_white_cells.append(input_grid[i, j])\n\n        # Place the collected non-white cells in the output grid, starting from the last row.\n        for i, color in enumerate(non_white_cells):\n            output_grid[output_grid.shape[0] - 1 - i, j] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
