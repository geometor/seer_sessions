It is only the first non-white cell for each column.\n\n3. **Translate to last row:** move the set of recorded colors to the last row of the output grid. The order of colors in a column are maintained.\n\n4.  **Clear other rows:** Set all cells in the rows above to be white.\n\n**Explanation of the previous error and adjustments**\nThe error in the first example arises because there were cells that were not set to white.\n\nI have improved the description.\n"
