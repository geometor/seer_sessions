One object is magenta (color 6) and appears in the upper part of the grid. The second object is red (color 2) and is located below the magenta object. Both are surrounded by white (color 0) pixels.\n*    The magenta object appears to be an inverted \"U\" shape, or maybe a simplified arch.\n*   The red object seems to be a square with a single white pixel in its center.\n\n*   **Output:** The output grid is almost identical to the input, except for the leftmost column of the red object. The two, red, leftmost pixels of the object are set to white.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
