Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identifies azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
Removes all azure pixels that are in the leftmost column containing any azure pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid by removing azure pixels in the leftmost azure column."""
    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # Find the azure pixels
    azure_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 8)
    
    # Find the leftmost x-coordinate (column) containing azure pixels
    if azure_pixels.size > 0:
      min_x = np.min(azure_pixels[:, 1])

      # Iterate through all azure pixels and remove those in the leftmost column
      for r, c in azure_pixels:
          if c == min_x:
              output_grid[r, c] = 0

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
