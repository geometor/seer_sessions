"""
1. Identify all distinct objects in the input grid.
2. For each object, find the leftmost column.
3. Check if all pixels in the leftmost column of the object have the same color as the object itself in the input grid.
4. If they do, change the color of those pixels in the leftmost column to white (0) in the output grid.
5. If an object's leftmost column has mixed colors (some matching the object, some not), do not modify it.
6. Leave all other parts of the image unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
