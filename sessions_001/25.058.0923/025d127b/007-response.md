Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors.
*   The primary color involved is azure (8), with a background of white (0).
*   The azure pixels form a diagonal line pattern, resembling a mirrored, or reflected, "L" shape.
*   The transformation seems to involve a subtle shift or deletion of specific azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_shape
    type: connected_pixels
    color: azure (8)
    initial_shape: mirrored_L
    properties:
      - attribute: position
        description: location on the grid

actions:
  - type: shift
    object: azure_shape
    properties:
      - attribute: direction
        value: left
      - attribute: magnitude
        value: one pixel

relationships:
    - object1: azure_shape
      object2: grid_boundary
      relation: constrained_by

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the connected azure (8) pixels forming a mirrored "L" shape within the input grid.
2.  Shift the leftmost vertical line of the "L" shape one pixel to the left. Since the line extends to the edge of the "grid," the new shape will eliminate the leftmost column of the shape.
3.  The remaining azure pixels form the output grid.

In essence, the transformation "erases" the left most vertical line of azure pixels from the input shape.
