            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying a magenta inverted-U shape and a red square, then changing the leftmost column of the red square to white. The code successfully performs this transformation on the first example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule is too specific and doesn't generalize to all cases. The core issue is that the initial program assumes the presence of *both* a magenta inverted-U and a red square, and it always targets the red object. The other examples show different shapes and colors being manipulated. We need a more general rule. The key seems to be identifying a specific object and changing its leftmost column to white, but the criteria for selecting *which* object to modify needs adjustment.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo get a clearer picture, let's examine each example pair individually using `code_execution`. I'll check the shapes and colors of objects, and most importantly, the difference between input and output.\n\n```tool_code\ndef examine_example(example):\n    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])\n    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)\n\n    print(f\"Example Input:\\n{input_grid}\")\n    print(f\"Example Output:\\n{output_grid}\")\n    print(f\"Predicted Output:\\n{predicted_output}\")    \n    print(f\"Differences between Input and Output:\\n{output_grid - input_grid}\")\n    print(f\"Differences between Prediction and Output:\\n{output_grid - predicted_output}\")\n    print(f\"Input Objects:\\n{find_objects(input_grid)}\")\n    print(f\"Output Objects:\\n{find_objects(output_grid)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\ntrain = task[\"train\"]\nfor i, example in enumerate(train):\n    print(f\"Training Example {i + 1}:\")\n    examine_example(example)\n\n```"
