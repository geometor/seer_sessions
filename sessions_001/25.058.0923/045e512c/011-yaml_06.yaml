    objects:
      - name: blue_pixel
        color: blue
        role: center
        initial_position: varies
        final_position: "center row of the grid"
      - name: red_pixels
        color: red
        role: horizontal_component
        initial_position: "adjacent to blue pixel"
        final_position: "fills grid, except where yellow occupies, mirrored across blue"
      - name: yellow_pixels
        color: yellow
        role: vertical_component
        initial_position: "adjacent to blue pixel, including diagonals"
        final_position: "fills grid column, mirrored, and extends diagonally"

      - name: fill_red
        description: "Expands red horizontally and fills the rows except for where the yellow lines exist"

        description: "Moves the blue pixel to the vertical center of the grid."
    observations:
      - note: "The number of red and yellow pixels in the input are not directly proportional to the output counts"
      - note: "The blue pixel does not move from its column"
      - note: "Train[2] shows the yellow replication is also diagonal"
