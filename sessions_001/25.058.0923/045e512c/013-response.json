There's a grey 'C' shaped object (color 5), a magenta object (color 6) at the top, and a blue object (color 1) below. Most of the grid is filled with white (color 0).\n*   **Output:**  The grey 'C' object remains unchanged. The magenta object (6) is replicated multiple times, seemingly tracing a diagonal path both up and down from its original position, with some parts overlapping. The blue object (color 1) is also copied and spread, also forming diagonal shapes, but with the original shape more recognizable and expanded. The shapes created from replication have the same size as the original objects.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Create copies extending upwards and to the right, and downwards and to the left. Allow overlapping copies. It should be 2 copies upwards and 2 downwards, following the diagonal lines.\n4.  **Blue Object (1):** Replicate the blue 'L' shaped object. The replication maintains the 'L' shape and seems to extend diagonally both upwards-right, and downwards-left. It should generate a 3x3 grid of 1s in a diagonal direction and a 2x2 downwards.\n\nEssentially, the core concept appears to be replication and expansion of colored objects along diagonal lines, with the grey object as a static element.\n"
