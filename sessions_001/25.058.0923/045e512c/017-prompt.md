Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate three distinct objects: a grey "C" shaped object (color 5), a magenta pixel (color 6), and a blue "L" shaped object (color 1).
2.  **Grey Object Transformation:** The grey "C" shaped object remains unchanged in both position and shape.
3.  **Magenta Pixel Transformation:** The magenta pixel replicates. One new magenta pixel appears one step diagonally upwards and to the right. A second new magenta pixel is created two steps down and two to the left of the original. A third magenta pixel is created one step down, and to the left of the original magenta pixel.
4.  **Blue "L" Object Transformation:** The blue "L" shaped object replicates diagonally. It expands one unit upwards and to the right, and one unit down and to the left maintaining its "L" shape.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
