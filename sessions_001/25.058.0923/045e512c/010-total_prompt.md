Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observing a "cross" shape expansion. It correctly identified the blue pixel as the center and attempted to replicate red and yellow pixels based on their relative positions to the center.  It then fills in between the replicated red lines. However, the replication logic and filling logic isn't generalized.  It appears the previous attempt focused mostly on Example 0. We will address other examples.  The strategy will involve:

1.  **Verifying Core Assumptions:** Re-examine each example to confirm the blue pixel is always the center of the transformation and what rules govern replication.
2.  **Precise Relative Positioning:** Develop a robust way to identify the relative positions of the red and yellow pixels *without* hardcoding offsets, since distances might vary in more complex tasks.
3.  **Generalized Replication:** The replication logic needs to work based on detected patterns (e.g., mirroring, symmetry) and not fixed offsets.  The current approach assumes specific arrangements and line configurations
4.  **Refine Filling Logic**.  The fill logic must correctly generalize.

**Metrics and Observations**

I'll use code execution to gather information about the grids and the results.

    if num_diff > 0:

transformations:
  - action: replicate_red
    description: >
      Replicate red line segment in a mirrored pattern around center, extend to edges, fill
      area bordered by the replicated lines with red
  - action: replicate_yellow
    description: >
      Replicate the yellow line segment vertically above and below
      the center blue pixel, aligned with the input position
  - action: move_center
    description: move the center blue pixel vertically to the center row of the grid

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Find the single blue pixel in the input grid. This is the center of the transformation.
2.  **Locate Red Segments:** Identify red pixels adjacent to the blue pixel. This forms a red line segment. There may be multiple red segments
3. **Locate Yellow Segments:** Identify yellow segments of pixels adjacent to the blue pixel.
4.  **Replicate Red:**  Create a mirrored replication of the red segment.  The replicated segment will be on the opposite side of the blue pixel.  The replicated segment will extend to the edges of the grid.  Fill the area bounded by the replicated red lines with red.
5.  **Replicate Yellow:** Replicate the yellow line segments vertically, both above and below the center blue pixel, aligned with the original column of the segment. The number of replicated yellow segments above and below is determined by the vertical position of the blue pixel.
6. **Move Center** Move the blue pixel to the vertical center of the grid, maintaining its horizontal position.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
