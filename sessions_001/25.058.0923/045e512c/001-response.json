The primary colors involved are azure (8), green (3), and red (2), all on a background of white (0). The input contains distinct shapes formed by these colors. The output seems to modify these shapes, specifically by extending or replicating them, sometimes changing their structure significantly.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note their color, shape, and position.\n2.  **Process Azure (8) Objects:** For each azure object, extend it to the right. Maintain the original height. Increase the length, creating a horizontal series of the shape's height.\n3.  **Process Green (3) Objects:** For each green object, extend it *to the right*. Create a series of repetitions, forming a horizontal line. The output object is many times larger, the length of repetition is large and uniform.\n4. **Process Red (2) Objects:** For each red object. extend it *down*. Make multiple repetitions forming a vertical shape. Make similar repetition horizontally too.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule involves replicating and extending existing objects, mostly to the right and sometimes downwards, based on their initial color. The azure and green objects are only extended to the right, while the red ones are extended both horizontally and vertically.\n"
