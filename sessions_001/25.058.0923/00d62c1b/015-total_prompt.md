Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate the contiguous region of pixels with the value '3' (green) within the input grid. This forms the 'green_shape'.
2.  **Find the Central Rectangular Region:** Within the 'green_shape', identify a rectangular sub-region. It is a rectangle within the central area of the green shape, that includes all rows and all columns of green cells that form a continuous section.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the pixels within this rectangular region from '3' (green) to '4' (yellow).
4.  **Output:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the pixels within the identified rectangular region, which are now yellow.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
