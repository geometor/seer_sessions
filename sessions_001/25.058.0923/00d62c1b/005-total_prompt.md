Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are green (color value 3).
2.  **Check for Diagonal Adjacency:** For each green pixel, check if it has any diagonally adjacent pixels that are also green.
3. **Apply Transformation based on 'Upper-Left' Rule:**
   - If two green pixels are diagonally adjacent, change the color of the upper-left pixel to yellow.
   - A pixel 'A' is considered "upper-left" relative to another pixel 'B' if:
        - Pixel A's row coordinate is less than Pixel B's row coordinate.
     OR
        - Pixel A's row coordinate is equal to the pixel B's row coordinate, and Pixel A's column coordinate is less than Pixel B's.
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
