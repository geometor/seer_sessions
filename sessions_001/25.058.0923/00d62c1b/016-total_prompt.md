Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate the contiguous region of pixels with the value '3' (green) within the input grid. This forms the 'green_shape'.
2.  **Find the Central Rectangular Region:** Within the 'green_shape', identify a rectangular sub-region. It is a rectangle within the central area of the green shape, that includes all rows and all columns of green cells that form a continuous section.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the pixels within this rectangular region from '3' (green) to '4' (yellow).
4.  **Output:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the pixels within the identified rectangular region, which are now yellow.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, aiming to identify a green object, find a rectangular region within it, and change that region to yellow. The results across all training examples show that this approach is partially correct but needs refinement. The core issue is the definition and identification of the "central rectangular region." The current implementation simply takes the bounding box of the green object, which isn't always the intended inner rectangle. Some examples fail because disconnected green areas are included.

The strategy to resolve the issues will involve:

1.  **Improving Rectangle Identification:** Instead of just using the bounding box (min/max row/col), we need to find the *largest solid* rectangular region of green pixels *within* the green shape. This might involve checking for contiguity and avoiding inclusion of gaps within the rectangle. It must still only include rows and columns that are part of a continuous section.
2.  **Handling Disconnected Green Areas:** we need to filter the initial rectangle based on the green coordinates

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's an analysis of each example, focusing on the discrepancies and what they tell us about the transformation:

| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Expected Output Shape | Green Shape Description     | Issue                                                                 |
| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | (11, 11)    | (11, 11)     | (11, 11)              | Single, connected rectangle | Works correctly.                                                       |
| 2       | (13, 13)    | (13, 13)     | (13, 13)              | Single, connected rectangle | Works correctly.                                                         |
| 3       | (7, 9)      | (7, 9)       | (7, 9)              | Two disconnected parts     | Fails. The bounding box includes both, creating an incorrect yellow region. |

**YAML Facts**
```yaml
- objects:
    - name: green_shape
      color: green
      properties:
        - can be connected or disconnected
        - contains a central rectangle

    - name: central_rectangle
      color: yellow
      properties:
        - largest solid rectangle fully contained within the green_shape
        - formed by contiguous green pixels

- actions:
    - find the green_shape
    - find the largest solid central rectangle within the green_shape, considering only contiguous green pixels.
    - change the color of the central_rectangle to yellow

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Green Shape:** Locate all pixels with the value '3' (green) within the input grid. These pixels collectively form the 'green_shape'. Note that the green shape might consist of multiple disconnected parts.
2.  **Find the Largest Solid Central Rectangle:** Within the 'green_shape', identify the largest *solid* rectangular sub-region. This means:
    *   The rectangle must be composed entirely of green pixels.
    *   It should be the largest possible rectangle fitting this criterion.
    *   It should include all rows and columns that form a continuous section of green pixels.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of all pixels within this identified largest solid central rectangle from '3' (green) to '4' (yellow).
4.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the pixels within the identified largest solid central rectangle, which are now yellow.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
