Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all connected components of green (3) pixels.
2.  **For each** green connected component, **identify** the "internal" green pixels. An internal pixel is defined as a green pixel that is completely surrounded by other green pixels (up, down, left, and right - 4-connectivity). It will not be on the edge of the green region, by definition.
3.  **Change** the color of some of the identified internal green pixels to yellow (4). Starting from the top left, fill horizontally and stop when a different color is hit and do the same vertically and fill vertically.
4.  **Leave** all other pixels unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
