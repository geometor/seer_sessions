The primary color observed is green (3) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific region within the green (3) pixels and changing the color of some of those pixels to yellow (4). The shape formed by green pixels appears to be an irregular shape. The overall grid size is 10x10.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It is a rectangle within the central area of the green shape, that includes all rows and all columns of green cells that form a continuous section.\n3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of the pixels within this rectangular region from '3' (green) to '4' (yellow).\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the pixels within the identified rectangular region, which are now yellow.\n\nIn summary, the transformation isolates the green object and replaces the largest fully contained rectangle, from the \"center outward\" with yellow.\n"
