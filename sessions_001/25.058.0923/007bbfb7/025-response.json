The colors involved are red (2) and white (0). The smaller grid seems to be replicated and expanded in a specific pattern within the larger grid. The core pattern appears to involve placing copies of the original input grid into specific locations within the larger output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
