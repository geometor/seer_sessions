The primary color involved is white (0) and red (2). The output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input grid, with a specific pattern of replication and placement of the red pixels. The transformation involves some form of scaling and potentially mirroring, as we can observe symmetry around the axis of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
