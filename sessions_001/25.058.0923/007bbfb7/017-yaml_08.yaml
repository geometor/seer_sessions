          properties:
            shape: individual pixels
            color: varies (red, blue, green, yellow)
        - description: Output grid blocks
          properties:
            shape: 3x3 blocks
            color: same as corresponding input pixel
      actions:
        - name: Expansion
          description: Each input pixel expands into a 3x3 block in the output grid.
          details: The color of the input pixel is maintained in the expanded block.
