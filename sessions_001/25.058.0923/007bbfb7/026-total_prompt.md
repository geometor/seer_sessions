Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (9x9). The colors involved are red (2) and white (0). The smaller grid seems to be replicated and expanded in a specific pattern within the larger grid. The core pattern appears to involve placing copies of the original input grid into specific locations within the larger output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid_size: 3x3
  - output_grid_size: 9x9
  - colors:
    - red: 2
    - white: 0
  - object: input_grid
  - object_properties:
    - size: input_grid_size
    - elements: 2D array of colors
  - action: replicate_and_expand
  - action_details:
    - The input grid is replicated multiple times.
    - Replicas are placed within the output grid.
    -  Specific replica locations based on position and color
  - relationship: input_grid_to_output_grid
  - relationship_details: expansion and patterned replication
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled entirely with white (0).

2.  **Top-Left Corner:** Copy the entire 3x3 input grid into the top-left corner of the 9x9 output grid.

3.  **Pattern Replication**: copy select parts of the input to locations on the output:
    * Copy the top row of the input to output location (0,3)
    * copy the top row of the input to the output at (0,6)
    * copy the second row and third row to output locations (2,3) and (2,6)
    * copy columns two and three from the input to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)
    * copy column three to the ouput at (6,7), (6,8)
    * copy row three to (8,4)
    * copy elements (2,1) and (2,2) to output (8, 7) and (8,8)
    * All empty cells in the ouput are filled with color 0 (white).

In summary the input image expands on the output and parts of it are copied.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
