  example_1:
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [9, 9]
    input_colors: [0, 1]

    code_matches: True
    rule_description: "The output grid expands the input grid by a factor of 3 in both dimensions. It is filled with vertical stripes. The first three stripes are white (0), and the rest are blue (1)."
  example_2:
    input_shape: [3, 2]
    output_shape: [9, 6]
    input_colors: [0, 2]
    output_colors: [0, 2]
    code_matches: False
    rule_description: "The output expands the input horizontally by a factor of three and vertically by a factor equal to the input's height multiplied by (input_height, which does not appear to be the case)"
    discrepancy: "Incorrect shape and stripe counts. Incorrect factor logic."
