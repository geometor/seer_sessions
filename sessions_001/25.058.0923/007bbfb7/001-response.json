The core element appears to be a pattern of orange (7) and white (0) pixels. The input grid seems to be replicated and expanded, with some modifications, to form the output grid. The most notable change is an injection of additional white (0) pixels into the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Create a new 9x9 grid filled with the value '7'. Then, set columns 0, 1, 2, and 3, as well as column 6 to all zeros.\n\n3. **Superimpose pattern:** Apply the replicated pattern from step 1 onto the injected pattern in step two. Use the rule that orange pixels (7) will override the white pixels of step two, but white pixels (0) in the replicated pattern do not.\n\nIn short: The output pattern is a 9x9 grid of orange cells with four white columns (0,1,2,3, and 6). The input pattern is copied to the output, with 0's not overwriting the background and 7's overriding the white background.\n"
