            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved a 9x9 orange grid with specific white columns and superimposition of the input pattern. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this approach is too specific. The output grid size and structure, as well as the superimposition logic, need to be generalized. The core issue is that the function assumes a fixed output size and a specific arrangement of white columns, and superimposition is conditional which is not the general behavior.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to:\n\n1.  **Determine the output grid size:** The output grid size is not fixed at 9x9. Find how the size is related to the input\n2.  **Identify the background pattern:** The background is not always orange with white columns. Look for the general rule for building the background\n3.  **Generalize the superimposition logic:** It is not a simple copy limited by color, but there are likely other rules for determining the superimposed values and positions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the transformations better, let's analyze each input-output pair, focusing on:\n\n*   Input and Output grid sizes.\n*   Colors present in Input and Output.\n*   Positional relationships between Input and Output elements.\n\nHere's a summary of the observations. I will perform more targeted tests with code.\n\n*Example 1*\n\n*   Input: 3x3, Colors: 0, 7\n*   Output: 9x9, Colors: 0, 7, four white vertical stripes\n\n*Example 2*\n\n*   Input: 2x2, Colors: 0, 2\n*   Output: 10x10, Colors: 0, 2, five vertical white stripes\n\n*Example 3*\n\n*   Input: 4x4, Colors: 0, 6\n*   Output: 12x12, Colors: 0, 6, three white vertical stripes\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    shape = grid.shape\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)\n    return shape, unique_colors\n\nexamples = [\n  {\n        \"input\": [[0, 7, 0], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 0]],\n        \"output\": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[2, 0], [0, 2]],\n        \"output\": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 6, 0], [0, 6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0, 6]],\n        \"output\": [[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]\n    }\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n    input_shape, input_colors = describe_grid(np.array(example[\"input\"]))\n    output_shape, output_colors = describe_grid(np.array(example[\"output\"]))\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(f\"  Input: Shape={input_shape}, Colors={input_colors}\")\n    print(f\"  Output: Shape={output_shape}, Colors={output_colors}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n```"
