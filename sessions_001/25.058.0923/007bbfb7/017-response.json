            "text": "Okay, here's a report summarizing the analysis of the provided code, example results, and proposed updates to the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept of the transformation: expanding each pixel in the input grid into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid. The provided code accurately implements this transformation. The verification results across all training examples confirm that the code performs as expected, and there are no errors. The strategy is sound, and no error resolution is needed. We just need to re-iterate the final natural language program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo be absolutely certain, I'll use a simple check here. I don't need to use code execution, because the notebook already provides a perfect match report. But this is good practice.\n\nExample 1:\n- Input shape: (2, 2)\n- Output shape: (6, 6)\n- Result: Perfect match.\n\nExample 2:\n- Input shape: (7, 5)\n- Output shape: (21, 15)\n- Result: Perfect match.\n\nExample 3:\n- Input shape: (1, 1)\n- Output shape: (3, 3)\n- Result: Perfect match.\n\nExample 4:\n-Input shape: (5,2)\n- Output shape: (15,6)\n- Result: Perfect match\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_grid: [[red, blue], [green, yellow]]\n      output_grid: |\n        [[red, red, red, blue, blue, blue],\n         [red, red, red, blue, blue, blue],\n         [red, red, red, blue, blue, blue],\n         [green, green, green, yellow, yellow, yellow],\n         [green, green, green, yellow, yellow, yellow],\n         [green, green, green, yellow, yellow, yellow]]\n      objects:\n        - description: Input grid pixels\n          properties:\n            shape: individual pixels\n            color: varies (red, blue, green, yellow)\n        - description: Output grid blocks\n          properties:\n            shape: 3x3 blocks\n            color: same as corresponding input pixel\n      actions:\n        - name: Expansion\n          description: Each input pixel expands into a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n          details: The color of the input pixel is maintained in the expanded block.\n\n  - example_2:\n    input_grid: 7x5 grid with various colors\n    output_grid: 21x15 grid, with each input pixel expanded to 3x3\n    objects:\n      - description: Input grid pixels\n        properties:\n          shape: individual pixels\n          color: varies\n      - description: Output grid blocks\n        properties:\n          shape: 3x3 block\n          color: Matches corresponding input\n    actions:\n      - name: Expansion\n        description: Each input pixel is replicated as 3x3 block in the output\n\n  - example_3:\n      input_grid: [[black]]\n      output_grid: |\n          [[black, black, black],\n           [black, black, black],\n           [black, black, black]]\n      objects:\n        - description: Single pixel input grid\n          properties:\n            shape: 1x1\n            color: black\n        - description: 3x3 black output grid\n          properties:\n            shape: 3x3\n            color: black\n      actions:\n        - name: expansion\n          description: The single input pixel expands into a 3x3 block.\n\n  - example_4:\n      input_grid: 5x2 various colors\n      output_grid: 15x6 expanded grid\n      objects:\n        - description: individual pixels\n          properties:\n            shape: 1x1\n            color: varies\n        - description: 3x3 blocks\n          properties:\n            shape: 3x3 block\n            color: matches input\n      actions:\n        - name: expansion\n          description: Each input pixel expanded to 3x3\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule performs a pixel-by-pixel expansion of the input grid. Each pixel in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 block of pixels of the *same* color in the output grid. The output grid's dimensions are three times the dimensions of the input grid. The color of each pixel in the input grid is preserved in the corresponding 3x3 block of the output grid.\n"
