Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grid contains white (0) and red (2) pixels. The dimensions of the output grid seem to be larger than the input grid,specifically one row looks added to the bottom of the grid. The core transformation seems to involve changing the blue pixels to red and adding extra lines of output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    colors: [white, blue]
    description: Initial state of the grid.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    colors: [white, red]
    description: Transformed state of the grid.
  - action: color_change
    source_color: blue
    target_color: red
    description: Blue pixels in the input become red in the output.
  - action: row_addition
    description: additional row added at the bottom of the grid.
  - relationship: color_correspondence
    input: 1
    output: 2
    description: Input color 'blue' corresponds to output color 'red'.
  - relationship: dimension_change
    description: height increased
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  If a pixel is blue (1), change it to red (2) in the output grid.
3.  If a pixel is white (0), keep it white (0) in the output grid.
4. Add an additional row on the bottom of the grid.
5.  **Copy** row 3 to row 7 and row 4 to row 8.
6. Add an additional final row with the pattern 0,2,0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
