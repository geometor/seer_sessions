Okay, here's a natural language description of the observed transformation, focusing on objects, properties, and actions:

**Task Context and Overall Goal**

The task involves identifying specific arrangements of azure (light blue) pixels and strategically placing blue pixels in relation to them. The goal is to modify the input grid by adding blue pixels based on the presence and orientation of "L" shapes formed by azure pixels.

**Step-by-step Transformation Description**

1.  **Object Identification:** The primary objects are "L"-shaped structures made of azure (color 8) pixels. An "L" shape is defined as a 2x2 block of pixels where exactly three of the pixels are azure, and one is not.  There are two orientations to recognize:

    *   **Top-Left L:** An "L" where the empty cell in its 2x2 bounding box would be bottom-right. The corner is in the upper-left of the 'L'.
    *   **Bottom-Right L:** An "L" where the empty cell is in the upper-left. The corner is in the lower-right of the 'L'.

2.  **Spatial Relationships and Actions:** Once these L shapes are located, the transformation involves adding a single blue (color 1) pixel. The placement of this blue pixel is *relative* to the "corner" pixel of the identified "L" shape:

    *   **Top-Left L:** The blue pixel is placed one cell diagonally down and to the right of the azure pixel that forms the corner of the "L".
    * **Bottom-Right L:** The blue pixel is place one cell diagonally up and to the left of the azure pixel that forms the corner of the "L"

3. **No Change to Existing Pixels:** Only blue pixels added, and nothing is removed.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Scan** the input grid to find all "L"-shaped objects made of azure pixels.
2.  **Identify** the "corner" pixel of each found L-shape and determine if the corner is upper-left or lower-right.
3.  **For each Top-Left L shape, insert** a blue pixel at the location one cell diagonally down and right from the L's corner pixel.
4. **For each Bottom-Right L shape, insert** a blue pixel at the location one cell diagonally up and left from the L's corner pixel.
5.  **Output** the modified grid.

The original provided code misinterprets how to identify the "L" shapes. It doesn't find the *corner* correctly. It checks for a 2x1 area and checks for another horizontal azure pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
