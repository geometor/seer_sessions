Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Summary of Observations**

```yaml
input_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3 cells
  - object_2:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: reverse L-shape
      position: (3,4)  # Top-left corner of the object
      size: 3 cells

output_objects:
  - object_1:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: L-shape
      position: (1,1)
      size: 3 cells
  - object_2:
      color: 8 (azure)
      shape: reverse L-shape
      position: (3,4)
      size: 3 cells
  - object_3:
      color: 1 (blue)
      shape: single cell
      position: (1,2)
  - object_4:
       color: 1(blue)
       shape: single cell
       position: (4,5)
```

**Natural Language Description of the Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct objects, both colored azure (8). One is an L-shaped object in the top-left corner, and the other is a mirrored L-shaped object.
2.  **Detect the new objects**: we find that two blue pixels are inserted in the output image.
3.  **Determine insertion rule:** In the output image, a blue pixel appears in the place of an azure pixel with coordinates (x,y) if its neighbor to the right and neighbor to the bottom are not azure. The other azure pixels are not modified.

**Natural Language Program**
```
For each azure pixel in the input image:
    If it is not neighbor with an azure pixel to the right and bottom, then
        Change its color to blue.
```
