## Example 2

**input:**
```
7 3 3
6 6 6
3 7 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C7852A6C4C0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
5 5 5
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C785285D210>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels to another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains various colors (orange, green, magenta), while the output grid contains only white and gray. The spatial arrangement of the pixels appears crucial, and the transformation seems to be a simplification or filtering of the input.  The output is all grey in the middle row and otherwise white.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_colors: [7, 3, 6]  # Orange, Green, Magenta
    output_colors: [0, 5]    # White, Gray
  - observation: The output grid's middle row is entirely gray (5).
  - observation: The output grid's top and bottom rows are entirely white (0).
  - observation: The input grid's middle row consists of identical color.
  - observation:  The input grid's color in the middle row transforms to gray.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).
2.  **Middle Row Transformation:** For all pixels in the middle row of the input grid, set the corresponding pixel in the output grid to gray (5).
3.  **Other Rows Transformation:** For all pixels in the first and third rows of the output grid, set the pixel color to be white (0).

In essence, the transformation identifies and maintains the existence the input middle row, changing any color to gray. All other pixels become white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
