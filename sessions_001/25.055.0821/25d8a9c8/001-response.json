The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3 in this case). The colors in the input grid (yellow, red, green) are replaced with different colors in the output grid (grey, white). The transformation appears to be a simple color mapping, where each color in the input is consistently replaced by a specific color in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
