Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program performs a color substitution on a pixel grid. It iterates through each cell of the input grid.
If a cell is yellow (4), it's changed to grey (5). If a cell is red (2) or green (3), it's changed to white (0).
All other colors remain unchanged (although no other colors are present in this example).
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified color mapping."""
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each cell of the input grid and apply color changes
    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[i, j] == 4:  # Yellow to grey
                output_grid[i, j] = 5
            elif input_grid[i, j] == 2 or input_grid[i, j] == 3:  # Red or Green to white
                output_grid[i, j] = 0

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
