The input grid contains various colors (orange, green, magenta), while the output grid contains only white and gray. The spatial arrangement of the pixels appears crucial, and the transformation seems to be a simplification or filtering of the input.  The output is all grey in the middle row and otherwise white.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
