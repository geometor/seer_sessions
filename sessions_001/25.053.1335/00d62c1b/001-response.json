The input grid appears to have a pattern of '3's (green) against a background of '0's (white). The output grid seems to modify some of the '3's to '4's (yellow), specifically those horizontally and vertically adjacent to other '3's. It appears to find the '3's with adjacent '3's.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
