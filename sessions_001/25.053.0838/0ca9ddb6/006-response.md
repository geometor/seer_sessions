```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location of red and blue pixels.

1.  **Red Pixel Rule:** For every red pixel in the input, maintain its position and color in the output.  Introduce yellow pixels to its immediate, non-diagonal neighbors (above, below, left, and right) if these neighboring positions exist within the grid boundaries and are occupied by white pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Rule:** For every blue pixel in the input, maintain its position and color in the output. Change the color of its immediate, non-diagonal neighbors (above, below, left, and right) to orange if these neighboring positions exist within the grid boundaries and are occupied by white pixels in the input grid.

3.  **Other Colors:** Pixels of any color other than red or blue remain unchanged in their position and color from the input to the output grid.
