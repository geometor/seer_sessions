**General Assessment:**

This example again features red (2) and blue (1) pixels, and their corresponding transformations to yellow (4) and orange (7) respectively, reinforcing the established rules. This example includes a magenta (6) pixel which remains unchanged confirming rule #3. The core logic identified in the previous examples appears to hold, strengthening the hypothesis.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Existing Rules:** Ensure the red and blue pixel rules apply correctly to this new instance.
2.  **Confirm Unchanged Pixel Rule:** Check if the magenta pixel remains unaffected, solidifying the selective nature of the transformation.
3.  **Refine if Needed:**  The existing rules are likely sufficient, but this example provides further confirmation and an opportunity to detect subtle nuances if they exist.
4.   **Document:** Capture observations in the YAML block.
5.   **Provide Natural Language Program**: Describe the transformation precisely.

**Metrics and Observations (Pre-Code):**

*   **Input Grid Size:** 9x9
*   **Output Grid Size:** 9x9
*   **Input Colors:** 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 6 (magenta)
*   **Output Colors:** 0 (white), 1 (blue), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 6(magenta), 7 (orange)
*   The red pixel is at (2, 2). Yellow pixels appear orthogonally adjacent to it.
*   The blue pixel is at (7, 3). Orange pixels appear orthogonally adjacent to it.
*   The magenta (6) pixel at (5,6) is unchanged

**YAML Facts:**



```yaml
input:
  grid_size: [9, 9]
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: [2, 2]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 1  # Blue
      position: [7, 3]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 6 # Magenta
      position: [5,6]
      shape: single_pixel
output:
  grid_size: [9, 9]
  objects:
    - color: 2  # Red
      position: [2, 2]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 4 # Yellow
      positions: [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3]]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 1 # Blue
      position: [7,3]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 7 # Orange
      positions: [[6,3],[7,2],[7,4],[8,3]]
      shape: single_pixel
    - color: 6 # Magenta
      position: [5,6]
      shape: single_pixel
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Red Pixel Rule:** For every red pixel present in the input grid, maintain its position and color in the output grid. Additionally, if a white pixel exists immediately above, below, to the left, or the right of the red pixel (within the grid boundaries), change that white pixel to yellow in the output grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Rule:** For every blue pixel in the input grid, maintain its position and color in the output. If a white pixel exists immediately above, below, left, or right of the blue pixel (within grid boundaries), change that white pixel to orange in the output.

3.  **Other Colors:**  Any pixel in the input grid that is *not* red or blue remains unchanged, keeping its original color and position in the output grid.



```python
"""
Transforms an input grid based on the location of red and blue pixels.

1.  **Red Pixel Rule:** For every red pixel in the input, maintain its position and color in the output grid. Additionally, if a white pixel exists immediately above, below, to the left, or the right of the red pixel (within the grid boundaries), change that white pixel to yellow in the output grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Rule:** For every blue pixel in the input grid, maintain its position and color in the output. If a white pixel exists immediately above, below, left, or right of the blue pixel (within grid boundaries), change that white pixel to orange in the output.
