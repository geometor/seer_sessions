Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous groups of azure (8) pixels. Each group constitutes an "azure object."
2.  **Find Adjacent White Pixels:** For each azure object, identify all white (0) pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to any pixel in the azure object.
3. **Determine Blue Pixel Placement:**
   *  For each azure object:
       * Locate the top-left most azure pixel. If there is a white pixel directly to the right of this pixel, color this white pixel blue (1).
       * Otherwise, locate the top-right most azure pixel. If there is a white pixel directly above it, color it blue.
       * If neither, do not add any new colored pixel.

4.  **Output:** The modified grid with the newly colored blue pixels is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
