Okay, here's my assessment of the provided input-output example and a plan for figuring out the transformation rule.

**General Assessment:**

The input and output grids are the same size (11x9). The input grid contains a single object made of gray (5) pixels. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input, where the gray pixels have been replaced with either azure (8) or red (2) pixels. The transformation seems to be based on the position of the gray pixels within the original object. It appears we might be coloring the shape based on some internal skeleton or medial axis transform.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Clearly identify the gray object in the input grid.
2.  **Property Analysis:** Analyze properties of the object, such as its bounding box, perimeter, and internal structure, number of rows and number of columns.
3.  **Color Mapping:** Determine the rule that maps gray pixels to either azure or red. My hypothesis is that the mapping depends on the pixel's position relative to the object's "skeleton" or center. Pixels further away from the edges keep color 8, other switch to 2.
4.  **Natural Language Program:** Formulate a clear, concise natural language description of the transformation.
5. **Refine with more examples** Use other examples to make the description of the rule more accurate.

**Metrics Gathering (using code execution):**

**YAML Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: gray (5)
    type: contiguous_block
    initial_pixels: 21
    transformed_pixels:
      azure: 12
      red: 9

transformations:
  - object_id: 1
    type: color_change
    rule: "Gray pixels are changed to either Azure or Red."
    details: "The color change seems to depend on the pixel location, likely its distance from some 'center' or boundary of the object"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous block of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2. **Determine new colors**: For each gray pixel in the original object, determine it should map to azure or red based on its position in the shape.
3.  **Repaint:** Change the color of the gray pixels to new assigned color, and produce the output. Azure seems to be on the "outside" and Red on the "inside".

I suspect it is a kind of border detection, where one layer of the outside is 8 and the rest becomes 2. Let's call it "peeling".

1. **Identify** the connected component of gray pixels.
2. **Peel** - find the set of pixels that have non-gray neighbors
3. **Recolor** the peeled pixels to azure
4. **Recolor** the remaining pixels to red


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
