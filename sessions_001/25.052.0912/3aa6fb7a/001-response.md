Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:

```yaml
task: 001-example_1
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        instances:
          - shape: L-shape
            position: (1,1) # Top-left corner of the bounding box
            size: 2x2
          - shape: reverse L-shape
            position: (3,4) # Top-left corner of the bounding box
            size: 2x2
      - color: 0 (white)
        instances:
          - shape: background
            position: (0,0)
            size: 7x7
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        instances:
          - shape: L-shape
            position: (1,1)
            size: 2x2
          - shape: reverse L-shape
            position: (3,4)
            size: 2x2
      - color: 1 (blue)
        instances:
          - shape: single cell
            position: (1,2)
            size: 1x1
          - shape: single cell
            position: (4,5)
            size: 1x1
      - color: 0 (white)
        instances:
          - shape: background
            position: (0,0)
            size: 7x7
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

Here's a natural language description of the observed transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects are present in the input grid. One is a regular "L" shape, and the other is a reversed "L".

2.  **Locate Change:** We need to find where within each L-shaped object a blue pixel is inserted. Examining positions (1,2) for first L-shaped object and (4,5) for the second one, we find that these match the right-most and bottom-most pixel location of the L-shaped objects.

3.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   Preserve the two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects in their original positions.
    *   Change the color of the right-most pixel of first azure L-shape from azure (8) to blue (1).
    *   Change the color of the bottom-most pixel of second azure L-shape from azure (8) to blue (1).

**Natural Language Program**
Here is the program in natural language:
1. Copy the input to the output.
2. For the first L-shaped azure object in the top-left quadrant of the grid:
   - Find the right-most cell occupied by that object.
   - Change the color of that cell from 8 to 1.

3. For the second L-shaped azure object in the bottom-right quadrant:
   - Find the bottom-most cell occupied by that object.
   - Change the color of that cell from 8 to 1.
