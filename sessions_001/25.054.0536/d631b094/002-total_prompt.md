## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A517BBB0>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x7D20A517BCA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). The positions of the 1s in the input grid seem to be the trigger for the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - observation: "The output grid's dimensions are determined by the presence and count of a specific value (1) in the input."
  - action: count
    target: "cells with value 1 in the input grid"
    result: "number of cells with value 1 in output grid"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of cells in the input grid that have a value of 1 (blue cells).
2.  **Construct:** Create a new grid. The dimensions are Y=1 and X=the count from step 1
3. **Fill:** Fill all cells in the new output grid with the value 1 (blue).

In simpler terms the number of blue cells in input is used to determine the size of a new grid that will contain all blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
