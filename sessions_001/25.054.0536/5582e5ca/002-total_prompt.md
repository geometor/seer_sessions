## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A4F46A10>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A4F47FD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid consists entirely of a single color. The key seems to lie in identifying a dominant or specific color within the input. In this specific example, the color '4' (yellow) appears to be the most frequent, or perhaps has a specific location/property, and is used to fill the output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: [0, 3, 4, 6, 8]  # Unique pixel values in the input
  - type: pixel
    properties:
       color_id:  #possible values from COLOR_MAP

actions:
  - name: identify_dominant_color
    input: input_grid
    output: color_id
  - name: fill_grid
    input:
      - grid
      - color_id
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - input_grid contains multiple pixels
  - output_grid contains single color_id pixels
  - dominant_color is derived from input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the input grid:** Examine all the pixel values present in the input grid.
2.  **Identify the Dominant Color:** Determine the pixel value corresponding to the color yellow (4). In this case. (Note: I say "in this case" as this is based on a single example and the criteria may change in other examples).
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  **Fill the Output Grid:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the identified dominant color (yellow/4).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
