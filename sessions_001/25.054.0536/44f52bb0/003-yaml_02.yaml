facts:
  - task_id: "002"
  - object_types:
      - name: red_pixel_group
        properties:
          - color: red (2)
          - connectedness:  # Describes how red pixels relate to each other
              - type: fully_connected # All red pixels are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one other red pixel.
              - type: partially_connected # some red pixels might be adjacent, but at least one group is not connected
              - type: disconnected   # no groups of connected red pixels
  - transformation_rules:
    - condition: "red_pixel_group connectedness is fully_connected"
      output:
        - value: 1 # Blue
          size: [1, 1]
    - condition: "red_pixel_group connectedness is not fully_connected"
      output:
        - value: 7 # Orange
          size: [1, 1]
