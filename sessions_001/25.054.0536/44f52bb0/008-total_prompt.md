## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A502F250>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7D20A457DA20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors. The output is a single numerical value, also potentially representing a color, though presented as a single integer. The specific color mapping is provided in the system prompt.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    description: Input grid containing colored pixels.
  - type: integer
    value: output_value
    description: Output, represented as a single integer.

properties:
  - name: color
    type: categorical
    values: [0, 2]  # Based on the observed input
    description: Represents the color of a pixel, with 0 as white and 2 as red.
  - name: count
    type: numerical
    description: Number of the specified object in the input

actions:
    - name: count_colored_pixels, returns a value
    - change the value

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_value: "The output value appears to relate a change to a single color based on the count."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red pixels (value '2') in the input grid.
2.  **Change:** based on the count of red, it relates to a specific color. 3 red results to 7 (orange).

Essentially, output is orange.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
