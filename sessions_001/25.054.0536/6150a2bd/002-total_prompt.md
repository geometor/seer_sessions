## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A517BC40>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7D20A517BBB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a color. The transformation from input to output appears to involve some form of rotation or reflection, as the spatial arrangement of the numbers changes. The values themselves stay the same, it is their positions that change. It also may involves some sort of mirroring action.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      type: integer
      range: 0-9
      properties:
        color: mapped_value
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Each element occupies a unique position in the grid (row, column).
actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: The input grid's element positions are rearranged to form the output grid.
    details: It is a 180 degree rotation, or a horizontal flip + vertical flip.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 180 degrees to produce the output grid. This can be achieved in a two-step process using mirroring:

1.  **Horizontal Flip:** The grid is flipped horizontally. The first row becomes the last row, and vice versa.
2.  **Vertical Flip:** The horizontally flipped grid is then flipped vertically. The first column becomes the last column, and vice versa.

Equivalently, it is done by rotating the grid by 180 degree.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
