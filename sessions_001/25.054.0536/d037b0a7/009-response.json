While the core idea of \"red influencing subsequent rows\" was partially correct, the implementation has two major flaws:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Column Handling:** The original code filled the *entire* row below a red pixel with red. The examples clearly show that the change only applies to the *column* where the red pixel is located.\n2.  Missing Propagation: There are cases of color changes without the direct presence of red above\n\nStrategy:\n\n1.  **Refine Observations:** Focus on all examples to ensure you are not overfitting to early data.\n2.  **Column-Specific Logic:** Modify the natural language program and code to reflect that changes propagate downwards *within a column*.\n3.  Revise the description - focus only on completing explaining the actions of the task - avoid implementation suggestions\n\n**Metrics and Reports (Code Execution):**\nI am sorry, I do not have the tools in this context to perform code execution, therefore, I cannot provide a detailed report.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Represents the input and output data.\n  - name: pixel\n    type: cell\n    description: An individual element within the grid, represented by a color.\n  - name: red_pixel\n    type: pixel\n    color: red (value 2)\n    description: A pixel with the color value 2.\n\nactions:\n  - name: find_red_pixels\n    description: Locates all red pixels within the input grid.\n  - name: propagate_color\n    description: >-\n      For each column containing a red pixel, that pixel,\n      and all pixels below it in the same column, take on\n      the value of the highest pixel that exists.\n  - name: modify_grid\n    description: Creates a copy of the input grid and changes certain pixel\n      values.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Red:** Identify all pixels that are the color red (value 2) in the input grid.\n2.  **Propagate Downward:** For each column, identify the top pixel of that column.\nThen, for each column containing a red pixel,\nall pixels from that red pixel to the bottom of the grid in\nthat column become the color/value of the top pixel of that column.\n"
