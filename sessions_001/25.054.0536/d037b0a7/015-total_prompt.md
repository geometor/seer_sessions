Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the yellow pixel at the top-left corner (0, 0) and the red pixel at the center (1,1) and all the white pixels.
2.  **Yellow Expansion:** Copy the yellow pixel downwards, replacing all the pixels until the end of the column, inclusive.
3.  **Red stays in place:** The red pixel at (1,1) doesn't change.
4.  **Copy Red below:** The red pixel at (1,1) is copied in the pixels below it.
5.  **Preserve Whites:** All white pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
