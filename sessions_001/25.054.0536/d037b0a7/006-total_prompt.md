"""
1.  **Identify the Seed Row:** Examine the input grid. The "seed row" for expansion is the first row.
2.  **Identify the Expanding color**: The color to expand is the color that is present only in the first row that needs expansion.
3.  **Vertical Downward Expansion:** For each column in the seed row that contains the seed color, extend that seed color vertically downwards.
4.  **Stopping Condition:** Continue the downward expansion in each column until a cell with a non-zero, non-seed color.
5. **Replacement:** In the expansion, the seed color only replaces 0 colors.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code have a fundamental flaw: they only consider the *first* occurrence of a non-zero color in the first row as the seed. The examples clearly show that *any* non-zero color in the first row can be a seed, and each seed color expands downwards independently. The stopping condition (encountering a non-zero value) is correct. The replacement of only zeros is also correct.

The strategy is to modify the natural language program and subsequently the code to:

1.  Iterate through *all* non-zero colors in the first row.
2.  For *each* of these colors, identify the columns in which they appear.
3.  Perform the downward expansion for *each* color independently.

**Example Metrics and Results**

Here's a breakdown of each example:
* **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 0], [3, 0, 0]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[0, 0, 6], [0, 4, 6], [3, 0, 6]]`
    *   Seed Colors: 6
    *   Correct expansion: 6 expands down correctly.
    *   Missing expansion: The algorithm did expand color blue (4).
    *   Pixels off: 1

* **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[0, 2, 0], [7, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [7, 2, 8]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[0, 2, 0], [7, 2, 8], [0, 2, 0]]`
    *   Seed Color: 2
    * Correct expansion: 2 expand correctly.
    *    Missing expansion: None - The algorithm did stop when hit non-zero and non-seed colors.
    *   Pixels off: 2

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[4, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 2, 0]]`
    *   Actual Output: `[[4, 0, 0], [4, 2, 0], [4, 0, 0]]`
    *   Seed Color: 4, 2.
    *   Correct expansion: 4 and 2 expands correctly
    *   Missing expansion: None. The algorithm did correctly.
    *   Pixels off: 1

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the input and output data.
  - name: seed_row
    type: 1D array
    description: The first row of the grid, which contains the seed colors.
  - name: seed_colors
    type: list
    description: The non-zero colors present in the seed row.  Each is an 'object'
                 that will 'act'.
  - name: expanded_region
    type: 2D array
    description: The region of the grid below the seed row where expansion occurs.

actions:
  - name: identify_seeds
    description: Find all non-zero colors in the seed row.
  - name: expand_downward
    description: For each seed color, extend it downwards in the grid.
    parameters:
      - seed_color: The color to expand.
      - column: The column in which the seed color appears.
    stopping_condition: Stop when encountering a non-zero cell.
    replacement: Replace 0 colors with the seed color.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Seed Colors:** Examine the first row (the seed row) of the input grid. Identify *all* distinct non-zero colors present in this row. These are the "seed colors."

2.  **Iterate through Seed Colors:** For *each* seed color found in the seed row:

    a. **Identify Seed Columns:** Determine the column indices in the seed row where the current seed color appears.

    b. **Vertical Downward Expansion:** For *each* column index identified in the previous step:

    i. Start from the cell immediately below the seed row (row index 1).

    ii. Proceed downwards, cell by cell, in the current column.

    iii. If the current cell has a value of 0, replace it with the current seed color.

    iv. If the current cell has a non-zero value, stop the expansion for the current column and current seed color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
