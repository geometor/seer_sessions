The input grid transforms into an output grid. The colors present are white (0), red (2), orange (7), and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve a specific color, in this case red (2), influencing the output. The transformation seems to fill every color in the row below the red with the red color. It also fills the row above the red with the red color, in this case the above is white (0) and stays white.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
