Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation logic to the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was based on a simple 180-degree rotation and a specific color-swapping rule. While this worked perfectly for the first training example, discrepancies arose in subsequent examples. This suggests that the transformation rule is more complex than initially perceived and might involve context-dependent operations, or possibly multiple distinct operations that were not obvious from the first example. The color swapping seems partially correct, but the rotation may be dependent on something other than a fixed degree.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair, paying close attention to how the colors and positions of pixels change. Specifically examine where our code matched and did not match the expected output.
2.  **Identify Conditional Rules:** Look for patterns that suggest the transformation might depend on factors like the size of the grid, the presence of specific colors, or the arrangement of pixels.
3.  **Refine Color Mapping:** Re-evaluate the color-swapping rules, as they might be incomplete or have exceptions.
4.  **Reconsider Rotation:** The 180-degree rotation might be a simplification. It's possible that different rotations or reflections are applied based on certain conditions.

**Gather Metrics & Results Analysis**
I will start by examining the results, including the code output and expected output from the task example and comparing them to each other.
