facts:
  - observation: |
      In all examples, the input contains a single 2x2 square object of green (color 3) pixels.  
      The rest of the input grid is filled with white (color 0) pixels.
  - object_identification:
      - object_1:
          shape: 2x2 square
          color: 3 (green in input, 1 (blue) in output)
          input_coordinates: Varies across examples.
          output_coordinates: Same as input_coordinates.
          size: 4 pixels
  - transformation_rule:
       - The 2x2 green square object in the input is recolored to blue (1) in the output.
       - The white background remains unchanged.
       - location, height and width of the grids are the same between input
         and output
