## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 0 0
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x79ABB14361D0>

**output:**
```
1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x64 at 0x79ABB17CEB90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). The positions of the 1s in the input grid seem to correlate with the existence of the 1s in the output. Specifically, the input has blue pixels at (1,0) and (2,1) which are different rows, and the output shows two values of `1`.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task:
  input:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
    objects:
       - type: pixel
         properties:
           value: int
           color: string
  output:
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  relationships:
    - input contains two blue pixels (1).
    - output is composed by blue colored one values.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input is a grid, and individual pixels are objects.
2.  **Filter:** Find all pixels in the input grid with a value of 1 (blue pixels).
3.  **Count Rows:** Count the number of rows that containing a value of 1 (blue pixels).
4. **Construct:** The output grid is 1 row by N columns.
5.  **Populate Output:**  The output will be a 1 x N grid where each element is equal to `1`.

In short: The output counts the number of rows with at least one blue pixel, N, and returns a 1xN grid filled with 1s (blue).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
