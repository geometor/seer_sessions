The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). The positions of the 1s in the input grid seem to correlate with the existence of the 1s in the output. Specifically, the input has blue pixels at (1,0) and (2,1) which are different rows, and the output shows two values of `1`.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
