Previous Code:
```python
"""
Counts the number of blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid and creates a 1-row output grid where the length is equal to number of blue pixels
and all pixels are blue.
"""

import numpy as np

def count_blue_pixels(grid):
    """Counts the number of blue pixels (value 1) in a grid."""
    count = 0
    for row in grid:
        for pixel in row:
            if pixel == 1:
                count += 1
    return count

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid into the output grid."""

    # Count blue pixels in the input grid.
    blue_count = count_blue_pixels(input_grid)

    # Create output grid: 1 x blue_count, filled with blue (1s).
    output_grid = np.ones((1, blue_count), dtype=int)

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a simple observation from the first training example: counting blue pixels and creating a 1xN blue grid. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern. The code fails to produce correct outputs for some examples because it doesn't capture the actual transformation logic. The strategy to resolve this involves:

1.  **Careful Re-examination:** Analyze each input-output pair, paying close attention to *all* colors, not just blue. Look for spatial relationships, patterns, and object-like structures.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:**  The initial hypothesis (count blue pixels) is likely incorrect or incomplete. We need to formulate a new, more comprehensive hypothesis that explains *all* the training examples.
3.  **Object Identification:** Consider contiguous regions of the same color as potential objects.
4.  **Consider alternative colors:** Consider that a different color may be driving the logic
5.  **Spatial Reasoning:** The location of the objects relative to each other might matter.
6. **YAML and Program updates** Collect observations and refine the program based on the patterns

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To systematically analyze the examples, I'll describe each input-output pair, report the code's output, and note discrepancies.

Key Observations and Revised Hypothesis:

*   **Azure (8) and White (0) are Key:**  The input grids consistently have azure (8) and white (0) pixels. The white pixels form a distinct rectangular object.
*   **Output Size:** The output is *always* a 1x3 grid filled with blue (1). This suggests the output grid's width is *always* 3, not dependent of the number of blue pixels. The number 3 is the number of white pixels.
* **Revised Hypothesis:** The output grid is a 1x3 blue grid. The '3' derives from the width of the white rectangle.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: The input grid contains azure (8) and white (0) pixels.
  - description: The white (0) pixels form a rectangle.
  - description: The output is always a 1x3 grid.
  - description: All pixels in the output grid are blue (1).
  - property: output_grid_width
    value: 3
    derivation:  The width of the rectangle formed by white pixels in the input.
  - property: output_grid_height
    value: 1
  - property: output_grid_color
    value: blue (1)
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the White Rectangle:** In the input grid, locate the rectangular region formed by white (0) pixels.
2.  **Determine the width of the Rectangle.** Count the length of one side of the rectangle to determine the output grid width.
3.  **Create the Output Grid:** Create a 1x3 grid.
4.  **Fill with Blue:** Fill all cells of the output grid with blue (1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
