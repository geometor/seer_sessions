The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). It seems like the transformation involves identifying the presence of blue pixels (1s) in the input and creating a smaller, condensed representation in the output consisting only of blue. The spatial arrangement of the blue pixels in the input doesn't seem to be directly replicated in the output, but their quantity is.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
