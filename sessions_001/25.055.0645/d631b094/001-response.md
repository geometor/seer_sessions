Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 1x2 grid. The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). It seems like the transformation involves identifying the presence of blue pixels (1s) in the input and creating a smaller, condensed representation in the output consisting only of blue. The spatial arrangement of the blue pixels in the input doesn't seem to be directly replicated in the output, but their quantity is.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
  - action: count_blue_pixels
    input: input_grid
    description: Counts the number of blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
  - action: create_output
    input: count of blue pixels
    description: create a horizontal line of blue pixels of that length
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid:** Observe the 3x3 grid.
2.  **Count blue pixels:** Count the number of pixels with the value '1' (blue).
3.  **Create output grid:** Create a new 1 x N grid, where N is the count of blue pixels.
4.  **Fill with blue:** populate the created output grid with the value of '1'(blue) in each position.

In essence, the transformation rule is to count the number of blue pixels in the input grid and create a 1-row output grid where the number of blue pixels equals the count.
