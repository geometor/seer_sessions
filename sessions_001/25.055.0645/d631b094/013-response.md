Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. Most of the cells are '0' (white), except for a single cell with '7' (orange) in the top-middle position. The output is a 1x1 grid containing only the value '7' (orange). It appears the task involves extracting the non-zero value from the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 1x1 grid.
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers
    properties:
      - majority_value: 0 (white)
      - non_zero_values: [7]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements: integers
    properties:
      - value: 7 (orange)
  - action: extract_non_zero
    description: Identify and extract the non-zero value from the input grid.
  - relationship: output_value equals non_zero_value in input_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid.
2.  Identify the single cell containing value different than 0.
3.  Create output grid equal the value in the cell.

In simple word. Find the non-zero value in the input grid and create the output containing this value.
