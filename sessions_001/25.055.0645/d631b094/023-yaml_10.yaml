          count: 1
        - color: red (2)
          count: 1
        - color: yellow (4)
          count: 1
        - color: green (3)
          count: 1
      transformation:
          type: color_count_and_recreate
          notes: Each distinct color in the input is represented once in the output, maintaining the input order. The output is a single row.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          count: 2
        - color: gray (5)
          count: 1
      output_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        count: 2
      transformation:
        type: color_count_and_recreate
        notes:  Only azure appears in the output, its count matching its input count. The output is a single row. Gray is omitted.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - grid_1:
          - color: magenta (6)
            count: 3
        - grid_2:
          - color: blue (1)
            count: 2
      output_objects:
        - grid_1:
            - color: magenta (6)
              count: 3
        - grid_2:
            - color: blue(1)
              count: 2
      transformation:
          type: combine_and_recreate_rows
          notes: The output has two rows, corresponding to the two input grids. Each color from each input grid is replicated in its own row with corresponding counts. Output grid size expands to largest input.
