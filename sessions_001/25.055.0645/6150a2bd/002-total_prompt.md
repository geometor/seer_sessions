## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x73226F468520>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x73226F469A50>
Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid. The colors/values within the grid are preserved, but their positions change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color_coded: true

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
  - element_positions: change according to rotation
  - element_values: preserved during rotation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The values of the grid elements (representing colors) are maintained, but their positions within the grid are updated based on the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
