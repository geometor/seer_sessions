## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x73226F469A50>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x73226F468520>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation appears to involve some kind of rotation or reflection, and possibly a change in the colors, but not a simple color substitution. The spatial relationships between the colored pixels seems to be a key.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers 0-9

actions:
  - type: transformation
    input: grid
    output: grid
    description: Modifies the grid's pixel arrangement and potentially color values.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The relative positions of pixels within the grid appear to be crucial to the transformation.
  - type: color_change:
    description: color are not changed by simply substituting the color value, but perhaps are rotated or reflected

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Transformation:** Rotate the entire input grid by 180 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, or alternatively, reflect it both vertically and horizontally, which is effectively the same transform.
3. **Output:** The rotated/reflected 3x3 grid.

The core concept is a 180-degree rotation. The colors are maintained relative to their position after the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
