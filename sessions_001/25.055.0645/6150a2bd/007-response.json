Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation appears to involve some kind of rotation or reflection, and possibly a change in the colors, but not a simple color substitution. The spatial relationships between the colored pixels seems to be a key.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
