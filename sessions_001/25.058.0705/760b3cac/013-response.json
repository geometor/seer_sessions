The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors present are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). There are distinct clusters/objects of azure and yellow pixels. The transformation seems to affect only the azure (8) pixels, while the yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged. The change in the azure pixels appears to be a positional shift or duplication.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
