## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x711B65AE4BD0>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 8 0 8 0 0 0
8 8 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids (input and output) of the same dimensions (6x9). The grids contain single-digit numbers (0, 4, and 8) representing different colors (white, yellow, and azure, respectively). The transformation seems to affect only the azure (8) pixels, while the yellow (4) and white (0) pixels remain unchanged. The azure pixels appear to be "moved" or "extended" to the left.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x9
    elements: [0, 4, 8]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x9
    elements: [0, 4, 8]
  - object: azure_pixels
    type: pixel_group
    color: azure (8)
    input_location: varies
    output_location: shifted_left
  - object: yellow_pixels
    type: pixel_group
    color: yellow (4)
    input_location: fixed
    output_location: fixed
  - object: white_pixels
      type: pixel_group
      color: white
      input_location: fixed
      output_location: fixed
  - action: shift_left
    target: azure_pixels
    condition: "if empty space to the left within same row"
  - relationship: unchanged
    objects: [yellow_pixels, white_pixels]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8), yellow (4), and white(0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Process Azure Pixels:** For each azure (8) pixel, check if there are any white colored pixels(0) to its left in the same row.
3. **Shifting Rule**:
    *   If one or more white pixels are to the immediate left of a blue pixel in the row, the closest azure pixel to the right of empty space moves to fill the left-most white position adjacent to it.
    *   If there are no white pixels, do not move.
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** The yellow (4) and white(0) pixels remain in their original positions. Copy them directly to the output grid.

In essence, the transformation selectively shifts azure pixels to the left within their respective rows, filling the closest empty (white, 0) space to their left, while keeping other colored pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
