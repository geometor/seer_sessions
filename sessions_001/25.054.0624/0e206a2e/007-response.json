Both grids contain single-digit integer values (0-9), each representing a different color. The primary objective seems to be manipulating specific colored objects/regions within the input grid to produce the output grid. The transformation doesn't involve creating new colors; rather, it focuses on repositioning, and potentially combining or modifying existing colored regions. The background (represented by 0/white) appears to remain largely unchanged, serving as a canvas for the transformations.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
