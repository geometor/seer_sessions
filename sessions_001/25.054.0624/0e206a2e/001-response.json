Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The transformation seems to involve a selective shift or \"sliding\" of colored pixels, primarily those not colored white (0). The background (white pixels) remains unchanged. The movement of the colored pixels isn't random; there's a pattern. It appears as though non-white connected regions \"drop\" or move towards the bottom or the top. It looks like the direction is determined by their location, with top objects moving down and bottom objects moving up.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
