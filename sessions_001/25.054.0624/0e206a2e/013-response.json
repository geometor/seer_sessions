The input grid contains several colored pixels (non-zero values) scattered within a background of white pixels (value 0). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, where some, but not all, of the colored pixels have moved or been removed. There's a prominent cluster of azure (8) pixels, and their movement seems important. The yellow (4) pixel does not move.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
