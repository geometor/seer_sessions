general_rule: |
    Colored objects from the input grid are reconstructed in the output grid.
    The reconstruction maintains the shape, size, and color of each distinct object,
    but changes their position. Objects are positioned based on their original
    color, creating an abstract shape that depends on objects found in the input.
