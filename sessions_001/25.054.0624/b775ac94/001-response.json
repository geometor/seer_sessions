The primary difference between the input and output is a change in the arrangement and, to a slight extent, color of certain colored clusters. There are a few distinct clusters of non-zero pixels in the input. These clusters appear to be \"objects\". Some of these objects seem to undergo some kind of replication or duplication with slight alterations, while others remain mostly unchanged. The background (0, or white) is unaffected.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
