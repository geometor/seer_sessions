The primary objects are contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. The transformation seems to involve some form of replication or expansion of these colored blocks, both horizontally and vertically, possibly based on the shape and color of the original blocks. There's a clear relationship between the configuration of colors in the input and the expanded configuration in the output. The background (color 0) remains largely unchanged, acting as padding.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
