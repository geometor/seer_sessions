Each region is an object.\n\n2.  **Flood Fill Expansion:** Each object expands outwards using a flood-fill algorithm. The flood fill expands to all adjacent (including diagonal) cells that are either background (color 0) or are part of the object's initial region.\n\n3.  **Color Mixing during Flood Fill:** During the flood fill, the expanding object uses its original color. If a cell occupied by the object is adjacent to another object, then it may absorb the adjacent object's color.  When the color is absorbed, the absorbed color is flood-filled, from that cell outward, using the flood fill expansion rule.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects in the grid.\"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= c < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def bfs(start_r, start_c):\n        queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n        visited.add((start_r, start_c))\n        object_pixels = []\n        color = grid[start_r, start_c]\n\n        while queue:\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            object_pixels.append((r, c))\n\n            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if is_valid(nr, nc) and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                    if grid[nr, nc] == color:  # Only visit same-colored non-background pixels\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n                        visited.add((nr, nc))\n        return object_pixels, color\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                objects.append(bfs(r, c))\n\n    return objects\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Gets the valid neighbors (including diagonals) of a pixel.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0), (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)]:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1]:\n            neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef flood_fill(grid, start_r, start_c, color, visited, original_object_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Performs a flood fill, handling color absorption.\"\"\"\n    queue = deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n    \n    # if grid[start_r,start_c] == 0: # Check that starting with background\n    grid[start_r, start_c] = color\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n\n        neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, r, c)\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                # Expand to background or original object pixels\n                if (nr, nc) in original_object_pixels or grid[nr,nc] == 0:\n                    grid[nr, nc] = color\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n                    visited.add((nr,nc))\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the flood fill and color absorption rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    visited = set() # global visited set for all flood fills\n\n    # Perform flood fill for each object\n    for object_pixels, color in objects:\n      # add the initial object pixels to visited\n      for r,c in object_pixels:\n        visited.add((r,c))\n\n    for object_pixels, color in objects:\n      # Find contact point between different object for color absorbtion\n        contact_points = []\n        for r, c in object_pixels:\n          output_grid[r,c] = color\n          neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n          for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if input_grid[nr,nc] != 0 and input_grid[nr,nc] != color:\n                contact_points.append( (nr,nc,input_grid[nr,nc]) ) # store contact points\n\n        # expand object's own color\n        for r,c in object_pixels:\n          flood_fill(output_grid,r,c, color, visited, object_pixels)\n\n        # expand object's with adjacent object's color if exists\n        for r, c, absorbed_color in contact_points:\n          flood_fill(output_grid, r, c, absorbed_color, visited, object_pixels) # pass object\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
