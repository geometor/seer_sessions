The transformation seems to involve a combination of object duplication and shifting/expansion. Specifically, colored objects in the input grid appear to be replicated and, in some cases, expanded horizontally in the output grid. The background (white, represented by '0') remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
