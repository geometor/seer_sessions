An interior pixel is any red pixel that would still be part of a contiguous red object if any *single* non-red neighbor was hypothetically changed to red. In other words if a red pixel is changed to green in the output grid, it means that all its red-colored neighbors also changed to green.\n3.  **Create Green Pixels:**  Replace the \"interior\" red pixels identified in step 2 with green (value 3) pixels in the output grid.\n4. **Background**: All other pixels in the output grid remain unchanged or become white (value 0) if they aren't part of a transformation.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds objects of the given color in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input grid.\n        color: The color of the objects to find.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of objects, where each object is a set of (row, col) coordinates.\n    \"\"\"    \n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or not is_valid(r, c) or grid[r][c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.add((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == color and (r, c) not in visited:\n                current_object = set()\n                dfs(r, c, current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef get_interior_pixels(obj, grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the interior pixels of an object based on the revised definition.\n    \"\"\"\n    interior_pixels = set()\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n    for r, c in obj:\n        is_interior = True\n        neighbors = [(r - 1, c), (r + 1, c), (r, c - 1), (r, c + 1)]\n        red_neighbors = []\n\n        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 2:\n                red_neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n        \n        # check that all the red colored neighbor should also change to green\n        for nr, nc in red_neighbors:\n          red_n_neighbors = [(nr - 1, nc), (nr + 1, nc), (nr, nc - 1), (nr, nc + 1)]\n          for nnr, nnc in red_n_neighbors:\n            if (nnr, nnc) in obj and (nnr,nnc) not in red_neighbors:\n              # there exists a red neighbor's red neighbor that should not turn green\n              is_interior = False\n              break\n          if not is_interior:\n            break\n\n        if is_interior:\n            interior_pixels.add((r, c))\n    return interior_pixels\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # find red objects\n    red_objects = get_objects(input_grid, 2)\n\n    # find inner most red pixels\n    for obj in red_objects:\n      inner_pixels = get_interior_pixels(obj, input_grid)\n      # create green shapes at inner positions\n      for r, c in inner_pixels:\n          output_grid[r][c] = 3\n    \n\n    return output_grid\n```"
