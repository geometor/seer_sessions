Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Interior Red Pixels:** For each red object, determine the "interior" red pixels. An interior pixel is any red pixel that would still be part of a contiguous red object if any *single* non-red neighbor was hypothetically changed to red. In other words if a red pixel is changed to green in the output grid, it means that all its red-colored neighbors also changed to green.
3.  **Create Green Pixels:**  Replace the "interior" red pixels identified in step 2 with green (value 3) pixels in the output grid.
4. **Background**: All other pixels in the output grid remain unchanged or become white (value 0) if they aren't part of a transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
