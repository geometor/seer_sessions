Both grids are 10x10 and contain single-digit integer values (0-9), representing colors. The input grid contains a square-like shape made of '2' (red) pixels, surrounded by '0' (white) pixels. The output grid is mostly '0' (white) pixels, except for two vertically stacked '3' (green) pixels near the center, where the hole of the red shape was in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

It can consist of one or several 0 pixels.\n2.  **Find the vertical center**: The new pixels are vertically centered.\n3. **Place Green Pixels**: In the output, the center of the hole is made of two green pixels stacked on top of one another.
