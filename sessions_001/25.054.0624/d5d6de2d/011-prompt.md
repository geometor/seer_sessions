Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Shapes and Their Holes**: Find all contiguous red (value 2) shapes in the input grid. For each red shape, locate the internal "hole," which is a contiguous region of white (value 0) pixels completely enclosed by the red shape. Holes can be of any size (1x1, 3x3, or other dimensions).

2.  **Find the Hole Center**: Calculate the center coordinates of each hole. The center is determined by finding the center row. The columns are the range of columns the hole occupies.

3.  **Create Green Line**: For each hole, replace all of the white pixels with a horizontal line of green (value 3) pixels.

4. **Remove Red**: Change all red pixels in the input to white in the output.

5.  **Preserve other parts:** If any parts of the input are not red or the "hole" inside the red, then those pixels should be value 0 in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
