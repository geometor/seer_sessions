"""
1.  **Identify Red Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Interior Red Pixels:** For each red object, determine the "interior" red pixels. An interior pixel is any red pixel that would still be part of a contiguous red object if any *single* non-red neighbor was hypothetically changed to red. In other words if a red pixel is changed to green in the output grid, it means that all its red-colored neighbors also changed to green.
3.  **Create Green Pixels:**  Replace the "interior" red pixels identified in step 2 with green (value 3) pixels in the output grid.
4. **Background**: All other pixels in the output grid remain unchanged or become white (value 0) if they aren't part of a transformation.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and code were too simplistic. The core idea of identifying "red shapes" and then finding "interior" pixels was on the right track, but the definition of "interior" was flawed. The original concept of "interior" was too restrictive and resulted in turning almost no pixels at all. The results clearly show that it's not simply about *any* red neighbor, but a more nuanced relationship between connected red pixels. The code's `get_interior_pixels` function needs to be adjusted significantly to implement a more accurate "interior" pixel identification.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze the Failed Examples:** Carefully examine *why* the transformations failed in examples 1, 2 and 3. Focus on which pixels *should* have changed to green but didn't, and vice-versa.
2.  **Refine "Interior" Definition:** Develop a more precise definition of an "interior" red pixel. Based on the expected outputs, consider this: if all red pixels are considered as one large shape, the task becomes turning the inner pixels of the large shape to green.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to reflect the refined "interior" definition.
4.  **Revise Code:** Modify the `get_interior_pixels` function (and potentially other parts of the code) to implement the new definition.
5.  **Iterate:** Test the revised code on all examples, and repeat the analysis/refinement process if necessary.

**Metrics and Observations (using conceptual analysis - code execution is not available in this turn):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Expected:** 7 green pixels (a 1x3 block in the top red shape, and a 3x1 block in the bottom red shape).
    *   **Actual:** 0 green pixels.
    *   **Observation:** The concept of interior is clearly not working.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Expected:** 2 green pixels (two vertically stacked in the center).
    *   **Actual:** 0 green pixels.
    *   **Observation:** Same as Example 1.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Expected:** 9 green pixels (a 3x3 square inside top left shape).
    *   **Actual:** 0 green pixels.
    *   **Observation:** Same as Example 1 and 2.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Combine into Single Shape:** Consider all of the red pixels to make up a single combined object
3. **Determine Interior Pixels**: Within the single shape, identify pixels that are not on the edge. I.e. their neighbors include only pixels within the object.
4.  **Transform Interior Pixels:** Change the color of all "interior" red pixels identified in step 3 to green (value 3).
5.  **Clear Remaining Pixels:** Change all non-interior red pixels and any other colored pixels to white (value 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
