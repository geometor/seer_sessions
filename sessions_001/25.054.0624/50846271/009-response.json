            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code have a fundamental flaw: they are too strict in their application of the color change. The code correctly identifies gray pixels adjacent to red pixels, but it *always* changes them to azure, regardless of their context. The examples reveal a more nuanced rule: the gray pixel must be part of a larger structure or pattern that is affected by the presence of the red. Looking at the \"Expected Output\" images give us the correct answer, and a clear indication of where gray pixels should be changed. The key seems to be that only gray pixels that form a contiguous \"blob\" with other gray pixels, *and* are next to red, are changed. Isolated gray pixels next to red (or any other color) seem to remain gray.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improve Object Identification:** The current code treats individual pixels as the primary objects. We need to shift to identifying contiguous regions of the same color as objects. This will require implementing a \"flood fill\" or connected-component labeling algorithm.\n\n2.  **Contextual Rule Application:** Instead of simply changing *any* adjacent gray pixel, we need to consider the *object* the gray pixel belongs to. If a gray *object* has *any* red pixel as a neighbor, then all gray pixels in the gray object should be changed to azure.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example):**\n\nI will detail observations on each of the examples. Since I don't have `code_execution` capability in this text-only environment. I cannot compute counts programmatically. My analysis is based on visual inspection of the grids and images provided. I will approximate counts. I will use a simple grid index system, where the upper left coordinate is (0,0) and the bottom right will vary per the example's size.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*   **Input Size:** 20 x 22\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 20 x 22\n*   **Match:** False\n*   **Pixels Off (Approximate):** 20 (Based on visual comparison). Many azure pixels are incorrectly placed and many gray pixels are incorrectly changed.\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   The red object at (14,2) is correctly identified as adjacent to gray. The adjacent, connected gray pixels *should* be changed to azure. However, the code is changing gray all over. The red pixel at (5,9) and surrounding pixels are correct, as are the two red pixels just to its right, (5, 11) and (5,12). Many gray pixels at the bottom of the object are missed by the current algorithm.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*   **Input Size:** 20 x 19\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 20 x 19\n*   **Match:** False\n*   **Pixels Off (Approximate):** 17\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   Similar problems to Example 1. The large gray areas are mostly correct, except for the red intrusion around the middle, starting at (3,6). Most of the changes around the red shapes on rows 4 and 5 are correct, however, the bottom part of the top shape at (3,7) is missing a change.\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n*   **Input Size:** 18 x 19\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 18 x 19\n*   **Match:** False\n*   **Pixels Off (Approximate):** 16\n*   **Observations:**\n    *    Similar problems, but this shows a case where a single gray pixel next to red on all sides, row 8 column 0, *is* changed, but that is because it is part of a vertical \"line\" object which is touching red on rows 9 & 10.\n\n*Example 4:*\n\n*   **Input Size:** 11 x 12\n*   **Expected Output Size:** 11 x 12\n*   **Match:** False\n*   **Pixels Off (Approximate):** 5\n*   **Observations:**\n    *   This has fewer errors, and reveals a lot about the rule. The single gray pixels at (0,1), (0,6), (1,0), (1,8) and many others remain gray - this gives us a vital clue that only gray pixels connected to other gray pixels AND connected to red are changed.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: gray # 5\n    type: contiguous_region\n    action: change_color_if_adjacent_to_red\n  - color: red # 2\n    type: contiguous_region\n    action: causes_color_change\n  - color: other\n    type: any\n    action: preserve_color\n\ncolor_change:\n  - from: gray #5\n    to: azure #8\n  - condition: gray_object_adjacent_to_red_object\n\nadjacency: cardinal\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all contiguous regions (objects) of pixels with the same color. Consider pixels cardinally adjacent (up, down, left, right) to be part of the same object. Diagonal adjacency does not connect objects.\n\n2.  **Find Gray Objects:** Iterate through the list of objects, selecting those that are gray (color value 5).\n\n3.  **Check for Red Adjacency:** For each gray object, check if *any* of its pixels are cardinally adjacent to a red pixel (color value 2).\n\n4.  **Conditional Color Change (Object-Based):** If a gray object is adjacent to a red object, change *all* pixels within that gray object to azure (color value 8).\n\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels *not* part of a gray object that is adjacent to a red object retain their original color from the input grid.\n"
