The primary colors observed are white (0), gray (5), red (2), and azure (8).\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of the same color can be treated as distinct objects.\n*   **Transformation:** Some of the red (2) pixels are changing to azure (8). The transformation is localized and doesn't affect the entire grid. It appears the gray (5) pixels are unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If a red pixel is not directly adjacent on its left, right, above or below, to another red pixel, then it remains a 2. All other red pixels become value 8.\n4.
