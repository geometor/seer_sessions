            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the \"cross\" shape formed by red (2) pixels. However, it's too rigid in its placement of the azure (8) pixels. The examples show that the azure pixels aren't always *immediately* to the left and below the center. Instead, they seem to fill in gaps *around* the cross, sometimes extending it, sometimes placed diagonally. The current logic needs to be more flexible and context-aware regarding the placement of the azure pixels. The core issue is that the placement of azure is dependent on other nearby pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Improved Cross Detection:** The `find_cross_center` function is generally good and can be reused.\n2.  **Context-Aware Azure Placement:** Instead of fixed offsets, we need to examine the neighbors of the cross pixels. We need to consider different relative placements of the azure.\n3. **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic against all training examples after each modification.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    cross_found: true\n    azure_placement: \"left and below center, but cross extends further down, and left\"\n    correct: false\n    notes: >\n        The azure pixels were placed incorrectly.\n        The cross extends further down on the left side.\n        The existing code doesn't seem to account for variations in how the cross shape is formed.\n\n  - id: 2\n    cross_found: true\n    azure_placement: \"appears within and around cross, but not consistent\"\n    correct: false\n    notes: >\n        The cross is not fully formed, yet azure fills in gaps around the red.\n        It extends the red cross to full, contiguous form.\n        Placement is inconsistent, but generally near.\n\n  - id: 3\n    cross_found: true\n    azure_placement: \"left, below, and diagonal to center\"\n    correct: false\n    notes: >\n         Azure fills in around the edges of where red pixels are.\n         The cross extends further to one side.\n         Azure is placed correctly in some places, but not others.\n\n  - id: 4\n    cross_found: true\n    azure_placement: \"below and to the right of the central red pixel\"\n    correct: false\n    notes: >\n        The initial placement rule (left and below) isn't followed.\n        Placement is correct, but description is inconsistent.\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Red Crosses:** Locate contiguous regions of red (2) pixels forming a \"cross\" shape. A cross is defined by a central red pixel with four red pixels directly adjacent to it (above, below, left, and right). However, partial crosses (where one or more arms are missing) are also considered.\n2.  **Analyze Cross Neighborhood:** For each identified cross (or partial cross):\n    *   Examine the eight neighboring positions (including diagonals) around *each* red pixel that is part of the cross.\n3.  **Conditional Azure Placement:**\n    *   If a neighboring position is empty (0), and placing an azure (8) pixel there would *extend* the cross shape (making it more \"complete\" or connect it to other nearby red pixels), place an azure pixel at that position.\n        * \"Extend\" means adding a pixel that would make the cross have additional red pixels around it.\n        * \"Connect\" means the azure pixel would connect with two or more separate groups of red cross.\n4. **Copy all other pixels:** All pixels from the input that are not part of the modification defined above, are directly copied to the output.\n\nThis revised program accounts for:\n\n*   Partial crosses.\n*   Azure pixels filling gaps *around* the cross, not just at fixed positions.\n*   The concept of \"extending\" or \"completing\" the cross shape.\n"
