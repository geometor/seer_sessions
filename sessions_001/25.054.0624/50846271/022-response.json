A cross is defined by a central red pixel with four red pixels directly adjacent to it (above, below, left, and right). However, partial crosses (where one or more arms are missing) are also considered.\n2.  **Analyze Cross Neighborhood:** For each identified cross (or partial cross):\n    *   Examine the eight neighboring positions (including diagonals) around *each* red pixel that is part of the cross.\n3.  **Conditional Azure Placement:**\n    *   If a neighboring position is empty (0), and placing an azure (8) pixel there would *extend* the cross shape (making it more \"complete\" or connect it to other nearby red pixels), place an azure pixel at that position.\n        * \"Extend\" means adding a pixel that would make the cross have additional red pixels around it.\n        * \"Connect\" means the azure pixel would connect with two or more separate groups of red cross.\n4. **Copy all other pixels:** All pixels from the input that are not part of the modification defined above, are directly copied to the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_cross_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds all pixels that are part of a cross (or partial cross).\"\"\"\n    red_pixels = np.argwhere(grid == 2)\n    cross_pixels = []\n\n    for r, c in red_pixels:\n        neighbors = 0\n        if r > 0 and grid[r-1, c] == 2:  # Above\n            neighbors += 1\n        if r < grid.shape[0] - 1 and grid[r+1, c] == 2:  # Below\n            neighbors += 1\n        if c > 0 and grid[r, c-1] == 2:  # Left\n            neighbors += 1\n        if c < grid.shape[1] - 1 and grid[r, c+1] == 2:  # Right\n            neighbors += 1\n\n        if neighbors > 0:  # Part of a cross (even if partial)\n            cross_pixels.append((r, c))\n    return cross_pixels\n\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Gets the 8 neighbors (including diagonals) of a pixel.\"\"\"\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(-1, 2):\n        for j in range(-1, 2):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + i, c + j\n            if 0 <= nr < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= nc < grid.shape[1]:\n                neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef should_place_azure(grid, r, c, cross_pixels):\n    \"\"\"Checks if an azure pixel should be placed at (r, c).\"\"\"\n\n    if grid[r,c] != 0:\n        return False\n    \n    neighbor_count = 0\n    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n        if (nr, nc) in cross_pixels:\n             neighbor_count += 1\n    \n    if neighbor_count >= 1:\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find all pixels that are part of a cross (or partial cross)\n    cross_pixels = find_cross_pixels(input_grid)\n\n    # Analyze neighborhood and place azure pixels\n    for r, c in cross_pixels:\n        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c):\n            if should_place_azure(input_grid, nr, nc, cross_pixels):\n                output_grid[nr, nc] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
