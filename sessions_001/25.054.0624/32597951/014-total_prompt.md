Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value (represented by numbers 0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and green (3).  The input and output grids appear to be the same size. The core transformation seems to involve a specific interaction between the azure (8) and blue (1) pixels, resulting in the appearance of green (3) pixels in the output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 17x17
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 8, 3]  # Possible colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: azure
        value: 8
      - color: green
        value: 3
  - type: cluster
    properties:
        - shape: irregular
        - composition: contiguous pixels of same color
    
actions:
    - name: replace_color
      input: origin_color, target_color, location_criteria,
      output: modify the grid

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: a cluster of the azure pixels can contain a set of adjacent pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Clusters:** Locate all clusters of azure (8) pixels within the input grid. A cluster is defined as one or more azure pixels that are contiguously connected (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

2.  **Identify inner and outer Blue Pixels:** For each azure cluster locate the blue(1) pixels. For each cluster, blue pixels can be one of two types.
    *   Inner Blue Pixels. Those blue(1) pixels that are adjacent to azure(8) pixels *and* also adjacent to blue(1) pixels that are *not* adjecent to azure(8) pixels
    *   Outer Blue Pixels: those blue(1) pixels that are adjacent to azure(8) pixels *and* are *not* inner blue pixels.

3.  **Conditional Replacement, Outer Blue Pixels:** For all "Outer Blue Pixels", change any that are adjacent to azure(8) pixels to green(3).

4.  **Conditional Replacement, Inner Blue Pixels:** For all "Inner Blue Pixels", change any that are adjacent to azure(8) pixels to green(3).

In simpler terms, the azure clusters are having their adjacent blue pixels checked. If a blue pixel is part of the inner or outer set, it turns green; otherwise, it does not.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
