The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and green (3). The transformation seems to focus on a specific region within the grid, defined by the azure (8) pixels. Some blue (1) pixels adjacent to azure pixels are changing to green(3) pixels. The transformation only happens in specific areas.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
