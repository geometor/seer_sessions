There's a distinct region of '8' (azure) pixels in the input, which is modified to include '3' (green) pixels in the output. The overall structure of the grid and the positions of '0' and '1' remain constant. The key change seems to be localized to the area originally occupied by the '8's.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
