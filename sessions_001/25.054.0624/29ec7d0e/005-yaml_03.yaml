  - example_1:
      objects:
        - color: 1  # Blue
          type: region
          initial_state: Scattered regions and lines
          final_state: Expanded and connected into solid blocks, sometimes
          notes: Expands to adjacent white (0) pixels, under specific rules, connecting them.
        - color: 0  # White
          type: background
          initial_state: Background and gaps between blue regions
          final_state: Partially filled by expanding blue regions
          notes: Acts as a connector between blue regions
        - color: 2-9 # Other colors
          type: other
          initial_state: present
          final_state: unchanged
          notes: these pixels never change

      actions:
        - name: expand_blue
          description: Blue regions grow by converting adjacent white pixels.
          conditions: |
            White pixels are converted to blue if they are adjacent to existing blue pixels,
             *and* if they connect two blue regions *and* all changed pixels are either blue or
            white. Other non-blue pixels are unchanged.
          constraints: |
            Expansion and connection occur until distinct blue regions form larger, connected shapes.
            Expansion does not extend beyond filling gaps to join other regions.
