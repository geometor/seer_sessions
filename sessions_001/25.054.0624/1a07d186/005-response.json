            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code attempted to handle each example with specific logic, which led to a fragmented and inaccurate solution. It failed to generalize the underlying transformation rule. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly identify the relationships between different colored lines and their movements. It's treating each example as an isolated case instead of finding a unifying principle.\n\nThe strategy should shift towards:\n\n1.  **Identifying Common Objects and Properties:** Instead of hardcoding colors and directions, focus on identifying lines (horizontal or vertical) as objects, regardless of their specific color. Record their properties like color, length, and position (starting row/column).\n\n2.  **Relating Input and Output Positions:** Determine a general rule that explains how the position of a line in the input relates to its position in the output. Consider relative movements (up, down, left) and how these are determined by other objects present.\n\n3.  **Conditional Logic:** The movement of one line might depend on the presence and position of another line. Use this dependence in the transformation logic.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Objects:** Vertical green (3) and yellow (4) lines.\n    *   **Expected Transformation:** When green and yellow lines are adjacent, they move one step left.\n    *   **Actual Result:** Almost entirely incorrect. The code doesn't correctly detect adjacency and move the lines, it clears the grids.\n    *   **Key Issue:** Misinterpretation of adjacency and movement. The code doesn't correctly implement the shift to the left.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Objects:** Horizontal red (2) and blue (1) lines.\n    *   **Expected Transformation:** Red lines move up one row, blue lines move down one row.\n    *   **Actual Result:** Partially correct. The logic for individual colors move are correct, but it misses the case where blue 1 and read 2 are on adjacent rows.\n    *   **Key Issue:** Incomplete conditional logic. The movements seem independent but influence each other.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Objects:** Horizontal azure (8) lines.\n    *   **Expected Transformation:** The top azure line moves up one row, the bottom azure line disappears.\n    *   **Actual Result:** Incorrect. The logic for two azure lines are incorrect.\n    *   **Key Issue:** Hardcoded logic for relative row calculation is off.\n\n**YAML Fact Base**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects:\n      - type: line\n        orientation: vertical\n        color: 3  # Green\n        properties:\n          - adjacent_to: 4 #yellow\n            direction: right # right, left\n      - type: line\n        orientation: vertical\n        color: 4  # Yellow\n        properties:\n          - adjacent_to: 3 # green\n            direction: left # right, left\n    transformation:\n      - action: move\n        condition: adjacent\n        direction: left\n        color: [3, 4]\n        amount: 1\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects:\n      - type: line\n        orientation: horizontal\n        color: 2  # Red\n        properties: []\n      - type: line\n        orientation: horizontal\n        color: 1  # Blue\n        properties: []\n    transformation:\n      - action: move\n        condition: always\n        direction: up\n        color: 2\n        amount: 1\n      - action: move\n        condition: always\n        direction: down\n        color: 1\n        amount: 1\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    objects:\n      - type: line\n        orientation: horizontal\n        color: 8  # Azure\n        properties:\n          - row_position: top # top, bottom\n      - type: line\n        orientation: horizontal\n        color: 8  # Azure\n        properties:\n          - row_position: bottom\n    transformation:\n      - action: move\n        condition: row_position == top\n        direction: up\n        color: 8\n        amount: 1\n      - action: delete\n        condition: row_position == bottom and other azure exists\n        color: 8\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Lines:** Detect all horizontal and vertical lines in the input grid. A line is a contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color.\n\n2.  **Example 1 Specific Rule:**\n    *   If there are adjacent vertical green (3) and yellow (4) lines where green is to the left of yellow or yellow is the the left of green, both lines move one cell to the left.\n\n3.  **Example 2 Specific Rule:**\n    *   Horizontal Red (2) lines move up one row.\n    *   Horizontal Blue (1) lines move down one row.\n\n4.  **Example 3 Specific Rule:**\n    *  If there are two horizontal azure (8) lines present:\n       *   Move the top-most azure line up by one row.\n       *   The other azure line is deleted\n\n5.  **General Rule Considerations** There seems to be three different rules, one for each example.\n\nThe key improvement in this natural language program is a more precise definition of objects (lines) and a clearer description of the conditions and actions. The logic is still somewhat example-specific, but it is structured in a way that can be more easily translated into code. The next step is to try generalize even further.\n"
