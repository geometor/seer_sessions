Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (18x19). The grids contain single-digit numbers representing colors. The most prominent colors are 0 (white), 3 (green), and 4 (yellow). There's also a single 2 (red) in the input that disappears in the output.  The green and yellow colors appear to form vertical lines. The transformation seems to involve some interaction or modification of the green and yellow vertical lines, possibly based on adjacency. The red pixel seems to be irrelevant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 18x19
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    values: [0, 2, 3, 4]
    colors:
      0: white
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow

  - type: line
    orientation: vertical
    colors: [green, yellow]

actions:
  - type: modify
    description:  Pixels are changed based on their neighbors.
    
relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: Green and yellow lines are next to each other in specific columns.
      affects: modification

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all vertical lines of green (3) and yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Ignore** The red(2) pixel
3.  **Check Adjacency:** For each green pixel in a green line, check if it has a yellow pixel directly to its right.
4.  **Modify:** If a green pixel has a yellow pixel to its right, keep the green pixel. if there is no yellow to its right, remove that pixel.
5. **Check Adjacency:** For each Yellow pixel in a yellow line, check if it has a green pixel directly to its left.
6.  **Modify:** If a yellow pixel has a green pixel to its left, keep the yellow pixel. if there is no green pixel to the left, remove it.
7. **All other pixels are set to white (0).**

In simpler terms, we preserve only the green and yellow pixels in the vertical lines where those colors are directly adjacent to each other, and remove pixels in vertical line if they are isolated.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
