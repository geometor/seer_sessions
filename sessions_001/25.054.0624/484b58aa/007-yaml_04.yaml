objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      properties:
        height: 29
        width: 30
  - pixel:
      type: individual cell
      properties:
        color: integer (0-9)
        position: (row, column)
  - filled_shape:
    type: connected component
    properties:
      color: white(0)
      shape: irregular
      boundary: enclosed by colors

actions:
 - remove_white_shape:
        input: a "filled_shape" of white pixels
        operation: remove pixels of filled_shape
        output: none

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)
  - containment:  the grid contains pixels, filled shapes contains many pixels of white
