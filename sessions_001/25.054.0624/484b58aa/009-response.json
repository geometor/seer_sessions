            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a revised natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code focused on identifying and removing \"interior\" white regions. However, the test results across multiple examples show that this approach is not entirely correct. While it sometimes removes white pixels, it's inconsistent and removes pixels it should not. The primary issue appears to be with the definition of *interior* pixels, specifically on objects with holes. The code attempts to handle holes, but incorrectly.\n\nThe core concept of removing white regions is correct, but there are a number of other issues to handle:\n1.  White regions on the edge of the input aren't removed.\n2.  White pixels on the edge of a hole in another object should not be removed.\n3.  White pixels adjacent to other white pixels should not be removed.\n    *   If there are no adjacent non-white pixels.\n    *   If all adjacent non-white pixels are the same color.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happened in each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code correctly identified some white pixels but failed to remove the ones at the boundaries, and incorrectly removed interior colored pixels.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, the code incorrectly handled white pixels, including edge cases.\n*   **Example 3:** The code appears to have incorrectly removed non-white pixels and incorrectly kept some white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts and Observations**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    input_grid_shape: [29, 30]\n    output_grid_shape: [29,30]\n    objects:\n      - description: Large, irregular shape encompassing various colors.\n        properties:\n          - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n          - has_holes: true\n    actions:\n      - description: Remove white (0) pixels except when at image boundary or adjacent to different colors.\n  - example: 2\n    input_grid_shape: [29, 30]\n    output_grid_shape: [29,30]\n    objects:\n       - description: Large, irregular shape encompassing various colors, including holes\n         properties:\n           - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n           - has_holes: true\n    actions:\n      - description: Remove white (0) pixels except when at image boundary or adjacent to different colors\n  - example: 3\n    input_grid_shape: [29, 30]\n    output_grid_shape: [29,30]\n    objects:\n      - description: Large, irregular shape encompassing various colors and holes\n        properties:\n          - colors: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n          - has_holes: true\n    actions:\n       - description: Remove white (0) pixels except when at image boundary or adjacent to different colors\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\n2.  If the pixel is white (0):\n    *   Check if it's on the edge of the grid. If so, keep it.\n    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, diagonals).\n        *   If any neighbor is outside the grid bounds, keep the white pixel.\n        *   If all neighboring pixels that exist (are within bounds) are also white, remove the white pixel.\n        *   If neighboring pixels have mixed colors, keep it.\n3.  Copy all non-white pixels directly to the output grid in the same position.\n\nThe key improvement here is the more precise handling of white pixels, taking the grid boundary and the color of all adjacent pixels.\n"
