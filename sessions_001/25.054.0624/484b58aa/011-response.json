            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize for resolving the errors.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code fails with a `TypeError: setting an array element with a sequence` on all three examples. This indicates a fundamental issue with how the code handles array dimensions, especially during the removal of white pixels. The original natural language program and the generated code intend to remove white pixels surrounded entirely by other white pixels, *except* those on the edges. The error arises from how the code modifies and reconstructs the array after marking pixels for deletion. The intermediate `-1` value used to represent marked-for-deletion pixels, combined with removing rows in the `final_grid` construction, is likely the source of inconsistent array dimensions and subsequent failure. The approach is to first modify the existing code to properly report metrics, then simplify the transformation function to maintain consistent grid dimensions.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fix Metric Reporting:** Before modifying the transformation itself, ensure accurate metric reporting. The existing error prevents the metric collection code from running.  We'll temporarily modify the code to *not* raise the exception to get the metrics about where mismatches occur.\n2.  **Simplify the Transformation:** Instead of marking pixels with `-1` and then rebuilding the grid, a better approach is to *directly* modify the output grid by changing the relevant white pixels (0) to another color based on the neighbor analysis *without removing any*. We can use a color not present in the input as a temporary replacement. If a white pixel meets removal criteria, it can be changed to one of the colors found in it's non-white neighbors.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Natural Language Program:** Based on the metrics and simplified transformation, refine the natural language program for clarity and accuracy. The focus should be on maintaining shape and correctly identifying the removal criteria.\n\n**Gather Metrics & Analyze Examples:**\n\nLet's modify the code to prevent the error during execution and get the metrics using code execution.\nI'll remove the lines that are causing exceptions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, predicted_output):\n    \"\"\"Calculates and prints comparison metrics.\"\"\"\n\n    if predicted_output is None:\n        print(\"Predicted output is None.
