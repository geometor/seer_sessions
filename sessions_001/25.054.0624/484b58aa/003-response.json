            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program was \"remove all pixels of color 0 (white) from the input grid, keeping all other pixels in their original positions and with their original colors.\" The generated code reflects this, using `np.where(input_grid == 0, 0, input_grid)` to keep everything that wasn't a zero.\n\nHowever, the tests reveal a critical flaw: The implemented code *keeps* the zeros and other values, it *doesn't remove* the zeros. The output grids are the same size as the input grids, just with the non-zero values maintained. All examples failed with many `pixels_off`. The \"Transformed Output\" images confirm visually that zeros are not being \"removed.\" Instead of removing elements and thus potentially altering the grid's dimensions, the code merely sets the white pixels to 0, which changes nothing, since white is already zero.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the natural language program and corresponding code to achieve actual removal, which will change the shape of the grid. This means we can't use simple element-wise operations that preserve shape. We need to rebuild the grid, excluding the 0-valued pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on relevant metrics:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape (Expected) | Output Shape (Actual) | Pixels Off | Notes                                                                                           |\n|---------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | (29, 29)    | (29, 29)     | (29, 29)   | 59  | Many 0s (white pixels) are scattered throughout, especially in rows 6-9.  |\n| 2       | (29, 29)    | (29, 29)  | (29, 29)          | 72   |  Zeros concentrated in upper-left and scattered in lower-right                                                      |\n| 3       | (29, 29)    | (29, 29) | (29,29)            |  106        | Zeros concentrated in the middle and towards the lower-right  |\n\nThe consistent failure across all examples, with incorrect pixel counts and unchanged grid sizes, strongly points to the core issue: the white pixels are not being removed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 002\n    examples:\n      - example_id: 1\n        input_objects:\n          - object_id: grid_1\n            type: grid\n            colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n            shape: [29, 29]\n            has_white: true\n            white_pixel_count: 59\n        output_objects:\n          - object_id: grid_1_transformed\n            type: grid\n            colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n            shape: [29, 29] #expected shape\n            has_white: false # ideally\n            white_pixel_count: 0\n        transformation: remove_white\n        notes: \"The output grid should not contain any white pixels (0).

For each row, copy only the non-zero pixels into the new grid, maintaining their relative order.\n5. The final output grid's dimensions may be smaller than the input if white is at an edge and will be smaller in each dimension equal to the number of white pixels.\n\nThe core concept is *selective copying* of non-zero pixels into a new grid, effectively \"removing\" the white pixels by excluding them from the copy process. The relative positions of non-white pixels should be maintained.\n"
