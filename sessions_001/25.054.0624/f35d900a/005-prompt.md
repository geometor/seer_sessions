1.  **Identify Colored Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are *not* white (0).
2.  **Expand Each:** For *each* of these non-white pixels, create a 3x3 block in the output grid. The original pixel's color should be used for its entire 3x3 block. The 3x3 block should be centered on the original pixel's location. If this expansion would go past the edge of the input, constrain it to stop at the border.
3.  **Handle Overlaps:** After *all* expansions are complete, check for any overlapping pixels (pixels where multiple expanded blocks have a non-white color). For *all* of these overlapping pixels, set their color in the output grid to gray (5).
4. **Maintain background:** all un-affected pixels should stay white (0)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
