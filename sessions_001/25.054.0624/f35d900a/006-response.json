Note the original pixel is not adjacent to itself.\n5.  **Result:** The output grid now contains the expanded blocks with overlaps handled.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Gets the neighbors of a pixel, including diagonals, within grid bounds.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(rows, row + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(cols, col + 2)):\n            if (i, j) != (row, col):  # Exclude the pixel itself\n                neighbors.append((i, j))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the defined rules.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)  # Initialize as all white\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:  # Non-white pixel\n                color = input_grid[r, c]\n                # Expand into 3x3 block\n                for i in range(max(0, r - 1), min(rows, r + 2)):\n                    for j in range(max(0, c - 1), min(cols, c + 2)):\n                        # Overlap Check *during* expansion\n                        neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n                        overlap = False\n                        for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                            if input_grid[nr, nc] != 0 and input_grid[nr,nc] != color:\n                                overlap = True\n                                break\n                        if overlap:\n                          output_grid[i, j] = 5  # Set to gray\n                        elif output_grid[i,j] == 0:\n                            output_grid[i, j] = color # set to color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
