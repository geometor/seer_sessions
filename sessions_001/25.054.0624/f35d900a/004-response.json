The original pixel's color should be used for its entire 3x3 block. The 3x3 block should be centered on the original pixel's location. If this expansion would go past the edge of the input, constrain it to stop at the border.\n3.  **Handle Overlaps:** After *all* expansions are complete, check for any overlapping pixels (pixels where multiple expanded blocks have a non-white color). For *all* of these overlapping pixels, set their color in the output grid to gray (5).\n4. **Maintain background:** all un-affected pixels should stay white (0)\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_pixels_by_color(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the positions of all pixels of a given color.\"\"\"\n    return np.argwhere(grid == color)\n\ndef get_non_white_pixels(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds the positions of all non-white pixels.\"\"\"\n    return np.argwhere(grid != 0)\n\ndef expand_pixel(grid, position, color):\n    \"\"\"Expands a pixel into a 3x3 block, constrained by grid boundaries.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    row, col = position\n    for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(rows, row + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(cols, col + 2)):\n            grid[i, j] = color\n    return grid\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the defined rules.\"\"\"\n\n    # Initialize output_grid as all white\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    output_grid[:] = 0 # Explicitly set to white\n\n    # Create a temporary grid to store expanded pixels before overlap check\n    temp_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n\n    # Get initial positions of all non-white pixels\n    non_white_pixels = get_non_white_pixels(input_grid)\n\n    # Expand each non-white pixel in the temporary grid\n    for pos in non_white_pixels:\n        color = input_grid[pos[0], pos[1]]\n        temp_grid = expand_pixel(temp_grid, pos, color)\n\n    # Iterate through the temp_grid to build the output and handle overlaps\n    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):\n      for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):\n        if temp_grid[i,j] != 0:\n            output_grid[i,j] = temp_grid[i,j]\n    \n    # find overlaps and replace with color (5) gray\n    for i in range(output_grid.shape[0]):\n        for j in range(output_grid.shape[1]):\n            pixel_count = 0\n            for pos in non_white_pixels:\n              color = input_grid[pos[0], pos[1]]\n              expanded_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n              expanded_grid = expand_pixel(expanded_grid, pos, color)\n              if expanded_grid[i,j] != 0:\n                pixel_count+=1\n            if pixel_count > 1:\n              output_grid[i,j] = 5\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
