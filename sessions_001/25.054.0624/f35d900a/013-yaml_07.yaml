objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 16
      - height: 17
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: pixel
    description: individual cell in the grid
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0=white, 2=red, 4=yellow, 5=gray)
      - position: (row, column) coordinates

actions:
  - type: mirroring
    description: The relative position of the original colored pixels is preserved, with the original input mirrored in output.
  - type: expansion
    description: Expanding the colored pixels to their adjacent.
  - type: replacement
    description: Replacing white pixels with gray based on adjacency to colored pixels
    parameters:
      - original_color: 0 (white)
      - new_color: 5 (gray)
      - condition: adjacent to two differently colored pixels

relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels sharing a side (not diagonal)
  - symmetry: pattern is mirrored across a vertical and horizontal center axes.
