  input:
    objects:
      - color: 2  # red
        shape: single pixel
        count: 2
        positions: [[2, 1], [8, 6]]
      - color: 3  # green
        shape: single pixel
        count: 2
        positions:  [[2, 6], [8, 1]]
    grid_size: [14, 14]
  output:
    objects:
      - color: 2
        shape: 3x3 rectangle with a missing pixel at [1,1] - from input perspective
        positions: relative to the red pixels in the input
      - color: 3
        shape: 3x3 rectangle with a missing pixel at [1,1] - from input perspective
        positions: relative to the green pixels in the input
      - color: 5 # A new color!
        shape: single pixel
        count: 4
        positions:  creates two lines, each starts from a position that's down 1 and +,- 2 rows away from the center of a colored rectangle

    grid_size: [14, 14]
  transformation:
    - description: "Create two 3x3 rectangles, each centered on an input non-zero, non-black pixel. Replace the center pixel with gray(5)"
    - description: "In the output, each 3x3 area is offset down by one row from the position of the object it's based on."
