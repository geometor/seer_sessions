"""
1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with white (0) pixels.
2.  **Iterate:** Traverse the input grid row by row, and within each row, column by column, from top-left to bottom-right.
3.  **Expansion:** For each non-white pixel encountered in the input grid:
    *   Create a 3x3 block in the output grid, centered on the corresponding position.
    *   Fill the 3x3 block with the color of the original pixel.
    *   Constrain expansion within the bounds of the output grid (don't go out of bounds).
4.  **Overlap Check (During Expansion):** As you are placing pixels during expansion in the *output* grid, check the original *input* grid: If there are any adjacent (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) non-white pixels in the input grid, set the *currently processed* output pixel to gray (5) *instead* of the original pixel's color. Note the original pixel is not adjacent to itself.
5.  **Result:** The output grid now contains the expanded blocks with overlaps handled.
