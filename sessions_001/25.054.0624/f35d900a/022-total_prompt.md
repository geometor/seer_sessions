"""
1.  **Identify single-pixel objects:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0) and are surrounded by white pixels (or the edge of the grid).
2.  **Expand objects:** For each identified single-pixel object, replace it with a 3x3 square of the same color. The original pixel should be the center of the new 3x3 square.
3. **Connect Objects with Gray Lines:** Find pairs of 3x3 colored squares that are close to each other (in this case, green and azure squares). Draw gray (5) colored one pixel wide horizontal lines between them. The line is drawn such that every other pixel on the input line is mirrored to a corresponding pixel on the output line. The lines should start in the middle row and middle column of each square.

Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The current code correctly identifies single pixels and expands them into 3x3 squares. However, the line-drawing logic is flawed. It connects *all* detected squares, regardless of their proximity or relative position. The lines drawn are also not placed correctly, as they shift up and down the grid in different examples, and don't correctly draw the alternating gray pixels. The core issue is that the line drawing should be more controlled and based on original pixel positions and their vertical and horizontal relationships, rather than drawing a single line between the expanded squares.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Line Drawing Logic:** Instead of connecting all squares, connect only those squares whose *original single pixels* were horizontally or vertically aligned.
2.  **Correct Line Placement:** Ensure the connecting gray line is drawn precisely between the original pixels of the identified objects, with alternating gray pixels.
3. **Use original pixel position:** Use the row, col coordinates for the original pixel to determine how the gray line should be constructed.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input has two single pixels (red and green) that are diagonal, but not adjacent.
    *   The output incorrectly connects them, and the positions of expanded squares and the line aren't correct.
    *   The generated line isn't a simple horizontal line between centers, and the alternating pattern is not correctly produced.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input has two single pixels (blue and azure) that are in opposite corners.
    *    The output incorrectly draws expands them and draws connecting lines, although the connecting lines are misplaced between the expanded squares. The original pixels were diagonally positioned.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input has two single pixels (red and yellow) in opposite corners.
    *    The output incorrectly draws expands them and draws connecting lines, although the connecting lines are misplaced between the expanded squares. The original pixels were diagonally positioned.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input has two single pixels (green and azure) that are on the same columns.
    *    The output incorrectly draws expands them and draws connecting lines, although the connecting lines are misplaced between the expanded squares. The original pixels were diagonally positioned.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: single_pixel
    description: A pixel that is not white and is surrounded by white pixels or the grid edge.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixel (1-9).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - type: expanded_square
    description: A 3x3 square created from a single_pixel.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the square (same as the original pixel).
      - center: (row, column) coordinates of the square's center (original pixel's position).
  - type: connecting_line
    description: A horizontal or vertical line of alternating gray pixels connecting two expanded squares.
    properties:
      - color: Gray (5)
      - start: center of square 1
      - end: center of square 2

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Replace a single_pixel with a 3x3 square of the same color.
  - name: connect
    description: Draw a horizontal or vertical line with alternating gray pixels between single pixels that were on the same row or column in the input.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Single Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a color other than white (0) and are surrounded by white pixels (0) or the grid boundary. These are the "single pixels."
2.  **Expand to 3x3 Squares:** For each identified single pixel, create a 3x3 square of the same color centered on the original pixel's location in the output grid.
3.  **Connect with Gray Lines:** For every pair of single pixels in the *input grid* that are aligned either horizontally or vertically, draw a line of gray (5) pixels between their corresponding 3x3 squares in the output grid.
    *   The connecting gray line is placed in the output grid such that gray pixels replace output pixels that are on the same row or column as the original single input pixels, and the alternating gray pattern starts from the single pixel position.

This revised program addresses the critical issues of incorrect line connections and placement by focusing the connection logic on the *original* single pixel positions and establishing a clear rule of placement for alternating gray pixels on the lines.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
