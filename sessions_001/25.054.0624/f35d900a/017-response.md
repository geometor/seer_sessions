Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of mirroring and then expanding colors, followed by gray filling based on adjacency, has several fundamental flaws when confronted with multiple examples.  The mirroring is applied correctly, however the color expansion is not correct: expansion should only happen *after* all mirroring is applied, and expansion is only happening to white pixels *adjacent* to a colored pixel. The gray filling rule appears to be correct conceptually, but its implementation needs to precisely follow the expansion. The order of color expansion makes a large impact and this order is incorrect, leading to cascading errors in pixel placement.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Fix Color Expansion Timing:** The core issue is the order of operations.  Color expansion must happen *after* all mirroring operations. It cannot happen during mirroring.  The current code's `temp_grid` attempts to address this, but expands from the "original" mirrored color. Instead, we should copy the output after mirroring and expand based on *all* the colors present in the mirrored grid.

2.  **Correct Color Expansion Logic:** Expansion occurs in a specific color order and only fills white pixels that are orthogonally adjacent to the expanding color. The code currently is confused about which cells to expand, and is expanding cells adjacent to *white* instead of colored pixels.

3.  **Gray Filling Refinement:**  Gray filling is dependent on adjacent, distinct, non-white colors. The code is mostly correct, but might need boundary checks for robustness.

4.  **Iterative Validation:**  After each change, we must re-run all examples to confirm that the corrections improve the overall accuracy and don't introduce new issues.

**Metrics and Observations (per example):**

I will generate observations about each example.

**Example 1:**

*   **Observation:** Mirroring creates the general layout. Red and Green are placed and mirrored.  Expansion happens incorrectly - Red should expand to adjacent white pixels, Green to adjacent, and then gray should fill based on distinct adjacent colors. The provided output expands in all directions and doesn't respect adjacency.
*    Color Expansion is incorrect.
*    Gray Filling is not performed correctly.

**Example 2:**

*   **Observation:**  Blue and Azure are placed and mirrored. The expansion incorrectly expands the white pixels instead of expanding colors.  Gray filling is applied in incorrect locations.
*    Color Expansion is incorrect.
*    Gray Filling is not performed correctly.

**Example 3:**

*   **Observation:** Red and Yellow placement is correct due to mirroring. Expansion, however, is incorrect, expanding from white. Gray Filling is absent.
*    Color Expansion is incorrect.
*    Gray Filling is not performed correctly.

**Example 4:**

*   **Observation:**  Azure and Green mirroring are correct. Color expansion again, however, is incorrect - expanding from white instead of the colored pixels.
*    Color Expansion is incorrect.
*    Gray Filling is not performed correctly.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Mirroring:** Copy each non-white pixel from the input grid to its corresponding mirrored positions in the output grid. These positions are:
    *   Original position (x, y)
    *   Horizontal mirror (x, width - 1 - y)
    *   Vertical mirror (height - 1 - x, y)
    *   Diagonal mirror (height - 1 - x, width - 1 - y)
    *   If a mirrored position is already occupied by a non-white pixel from a *previous* placement, do not overwrite it.

2.  **Color Expansion (in order):**  After *all* mirroring operations are complete, expand specific colors in the *following* order, *one step* at a time:
    *   **Red (2):**  Replace any white (0) pixel that is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a red pixel with red.
    *   **Yellow (4):** Replace any white (0) pixel that is directly adjacent to a yellow pixel with yellow.
    *   **Green (3):** Replace any white (0) pixel that is directly adjacent to a green pixel with green.
    *   **Azure (8):** Replace any white (0) pixel that is directly adjacent to an azure pixel with azure.
    * **Blue (1):** Replace any white (0) pixel that is directly adjacent to an azure pixel with blue.

3.  **Gray Filling:** After color expansion, for any remaining white (0) pixels, check for direct adjacency (up, down, left, right) to at least two pixels of *different* non-white colors.  If this condition is met, replace the white pixel with gray (5).
