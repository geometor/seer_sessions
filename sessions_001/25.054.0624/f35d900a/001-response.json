The input grid primarily consists of white pixels (0) with a few red (2) and green (3) pixels. The output grid introduces gray (5) pixels and rearranges the red and green pixels, seemingly expanding and interacting with them. The output also maintains the background of white (0) pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain constant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If the edges go beyond the sides, then stop there.\n\n3.  **Overlap (Interaction):** Where the expanded 3x3 regions of red and green pixels overlap, replace those pixels in the output grid with gray (5) pixels.\n\n4. **Fill**: keep the rest of the grid as the same, white (0) pixels\n\nThis program describes a process of identifying, expanding, and interacting colored regions to produce the output grid. The key is the 3x3 expansion and the rule for creating gray pixels at the intersection of expanded red and green regions.\n"
