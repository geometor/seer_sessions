1.  **Mirroring and Initial Expansion**: Copy each non-white pixel from the input to the output, then "expand" the colors.
    *   Expand red (2) to all directly adjacent white pixels.
    *   Expand yellow (4) to all directly adjacent white pixels.
    *   Mirror the initial colored pixels positions across a vertical and a horizontal axis.

2.  **Adjacency Check and Gray Fill**: For each white (0) pixel in the *output* grid:
    *   Check if it is adjacent to at least one non-white pixel.
    *   Check if the adjacent non-white pixels contain at least two different colors.
    *   If *both conditions are true*, replace the white pixel with gray (5). Otherwise, keep the current value of the pixel.
3. If the cell is not white and has not been changed to gray, maintain its input color in the output grid.

Okay, here's an assessment of the situation, along with the requested deliverables.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and generated code were a good first attempt, capturing some key aspects of the transformation (mirroring, color expansion, and conditional gray filling). However, the results on the subsequent training examples clearly show significant discrepancies. The core issues appear to be:

1.  **Incorrect Mirroring Implementation:** The mirroring logic seems flawed. It's creating duplicates where it shouldn't and doesn't correctly handle cases where mirrored positions overlap.
2.  **Overly Aggressive Color Expansion:** The color expansion is happening in all directions and also overwriting existing colors from the first mirroring step, rather than just filling adjacent *white* pixels. The expansion should only be done *after* the final placement and mirroring of initial colors.
3. **Incorrect Gray Fill Condition:** There is an error, possibly related to the color expansion overwrites, in example 1, where the gray fill should have happened but didn't.
4. **Incorrect output size**: Example 3 output should be 16x16 but is 17x17

The strategy to correct this involves:

1.  **Fix Mirroring:** Refactor the mirroring logic to *first* place all non-white colors from the input grid and perform mirroring correctly, ensuring non-white pixels are placed only once.
2.  **Control Color Expansion:** Ensure color expansion occurs *after* the mirroring and only to adjacent white cells. This may involve using a temporary grid to track changes.
3.  **Refine Gray Fill Logic:** Double-check the adjacency condition for gray filling, making sure it correctly identifies at least two different non-white adjacent colors.
4. **Correct output dimensions**: Double check indexing is correct to not go out of bounds

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of what went wrong in each example.  I'm focusing on *why* the transformation failed, rather than just stating that it did.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Mirroring:** Partially correct initial placement, but color expansion overwrites.
    *   **Expansion:** Red and Green expands incorrectly, overwriting some of the mirrored values.
    *   **Gray Fill:** Does not perform all possible gray fills. Some places where two colors meet the gray is missing.
    *   **Overall:** Illustrates color expansion overwriting values and incorrect gray fill conditions.
    *   Size is incorrect, should be 14x14.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Mirroring:** The main mirroring logic is missing.
    *   **Expansion:** No expansion is being done at all.
    *   **Gray Fill:** No gray fill.
    *   **Overall:** Demonstrates very significant issues with the current approach, as nearly the entire transformation is absent.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Mirroring:** Mirror logic is incorrect.
    *   **Expansion:** No expansion is being done at all.
    *   **Gray Fill**: No gray fill
    *   **Overall:** Similar to Example 2, this shows a near-total failure of the intended transformation.

*    **Example 4:**
    * **Mirroring**: Mirror logic is incorrect.
    *   **Expansion:** No expansion is being done at all.
    *   **Gray Fill**: No gray fill
    *   **Overall:** Similar to Example 2 and 3, this shows a near-total failure of the intended transformation.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Initial Placement and Mirroring**: Copy each non-white pixel from the input grid to four corresponding positions in the output grid: the original position, its horizontal mirror, its vertical mirror, and its mirror across both axes. If any mirroring causes an overlap, place the colored pixel value once.
2.  **Color Expansion**: After *all* initial non-white pixels have been placed and mirrored:
    *   Expand red (2) pixels to all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels.
    *   Expand yellow (4) pixels to all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (0) pixels.
    *   Expand green(3) pixels to all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white(0) pixels.
    *    Expand azure(8) pixels to all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white(0) pixels.
3.  **Gray Filling**: After color expansion, for each remaining white (0) pixel in the output grid:
    *   Check if it is directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to at least two pixels of *different* non-white colors.
    *   If so, replace the white pixel with gray (5).

Key changes in the natural language program compared to the previous version:

*   **Mirroring Clarification:** Explicitly states the four placement positions and the "place only once" rule.
*   **Expansion Order:** Clearly states that expansion occurs *after* the mirroring step.
*    Added colors to expansion,
*   **Adjacency:** Specifies "directly adjacent" and "different non-white colors".

This revised natural language program should provide a much more accurate and complete guide for creating the corrected Python code.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
