Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves modifying a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved appear to be azure (8), green (3), and red (2), all on a background of white (0). The input grid contains distinct shapes formed by these colors. The transformation seems to involve replicating and potentially repositioning or altering these shapes, specifically concerning the green and red elements. The azure shape appears to serve as a reference or is somehow excluded from a specific operation that is applied to others.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
      - shape_1:
          color: azure (8)
          type: rectangle
          initial_position: row 7-9, column 7-9
      - shape_2:
          color: green (3)
          type: single pixel
          initial_position: row 8, column 11
      - shape_3:
          color: red (2)
          type: rectangle
          initial_position: row 11, column 7-9
  - actions:
      - replicate:
          object: shape_2
          pattern: extend horizontally right, repeating original, repeat,original...
      - replicate:
          object: shape_3
          pattern: extend vertically, alternating original shape and a shape with the middle pixel removed.
  - spatial_relationships:
    - shape_2: to the right of shape_1
    - shape_3: below shape_1, aligned vertically
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Shapes:** Locate the azure (8) rectangle, the green (3) single pixel, and the red (2) rectangle.
2.  **Replicate Green:** Take the green pixel and extend it horizontally to the right. Each cell will contain '3', such that new pattern is 3,0,3,0,3,0,...
3.  **Replicate Red:** Replicate the red rectangle vertically downwards multiple times. Every other red shape should have the middle red pixel removed and be replaced with a white pixel (0).
4.  **Preserve Azure Shape:** Ensure the process leaves the original azure object at its original position.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
