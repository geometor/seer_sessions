"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object
    is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color. Objects of the same color
    are still distinct if not directly touching.
2. **Azure Rectangle:** If an azure rectangle exists, it remains unchanged.
3.  **Green Pixel:** For each green pixel, replicate it horizontally to the
    right edge of the grid. The replication should alternate between placing a
    green pixel and leaving a blank space (color 0).
4.  **Red Rectangle:** For each red rectangle, replicate it vertically
    downwards. The replication should alternate between the full rectangle and a
    "hollow" version of the rectangle. The hollow version has the same bounding
    box as the original but with the center pixel(s) removed (color 0).
5.  **Yellow and Blue:** Consider more complex shapes of yellow and blue. Replicate in patterns including horizontal, vertical and diagonal
6. **Magenta Objects:** Combine and replicate to a diagonal pattern.

Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates to the natural language program and strategy.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code captures some key aspects of the transformation, specifically:

*   **Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function correctly identifies contiguous blocks of pixels as distinct objects.
*   **Green Pixel Replication:** The `replicate_green_horizontal_alternate` function implements the horizontal replication of green pixels with alternating blank spaces, but errors exist in blank space location.
*    **Red Rectangle Replication:** The `replicate_red_vertical_alternate_hollow` implements replication, but errors exist in replication.

However, the code has significant shortcomings:

*   **Incomplete Replication Logic:** The code only handles green and red objects and does not generalize to other colors. It doesn't handle variations in replication patterns (e.g., diagonal, specific shapes).
*   **Incorrect Transformations:** All of the examples failed.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Carefully examine *all* provided examples, not just the first one, to identify the complete set of transformation rules. Pay very close attention to any patterns that are related.
2.  **Refine Object Properties:** Extend the object identification process to include not just location, but also shape, size, and relative position.
3.  **Generalized Replication:** Develop a more general replication mechanism that can handle different directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and patterns.
4.  **Conditional Logic:** Implement conditional logic to determine which transformation rule to apply to each object based on its properties.
5. **Iterate** - focus on developing the simplest functions possible that demonstrate at least some of the key features of the example.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a more detailed breakdown of each example.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** Azure rectangle, Green pixels, Red rectangle.
*   **Expected Output:** Green pixels replicated horizontally with alternating blank spaces. Red rectangle replicated vertically with alternating full and hollow versions.
*   **Actual Output:** Green replication is not completely correct (spacing wrong). Red replication is also incorrect.
* **Metrics:**
    ```
    pixels_off: 28
    size_correct: True
    color_palette_correct: True
    correct_pixel_counts: False
    ```

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Yellow, Blue, Red and Green Pixels
*   **Expected Output:** Red Pixel creates solid rectangle, Green Pixel replicates, Yellow and Blue create a complex diagonal shape.
*   **Actual Output:** Replication is incorrect
* **Metrics:**
    ```
    pixels_off: 41
    size_correct: True
    color_palette_correct: True
    correct_pixel_counts: False
    ```

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** Magenta, Gray, and Blue shapes.
*   **Expected Output:** Magenta and Blue shapes replicate in a diagonal pattern.
*   **Actual Output:** No replication of any kind.
* **Metrics:**
    ```
    pixels_off: 21
    size_correct: True
    color_palette_correct: True
    correct_pixel_counts: False
    ```

**YAML Fact Identification:**
```yaml
objects:
  - color: 8 # Azure
    type: rectangle
    action: none # Remains unchanged
  - color: 3 # Green
    type: pixel
    action: replicate_horizontal_alternate
    pattern:
      - color: 3
      - color: 0
  - color: 2 # Red
    type: rectangle
    action: replicate_vertical_alternate
    pattern:
      - type: full
      - type: hollow
  - color: 4 # Yellow
    type: pixel
    action: combine_and_replicate
  - color: 1 # Blue
    type: pixel, rectangle
    action: combine_and_replicate
  - color: 6 # Magenta
    type: shape
    action: combine_and_replicate
  - color: 5 # Gray
    type: shape
    action: none
```

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects in the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Azure Rectangle:** Azure rectangles remain unchanged.
3.  **Green Pixel:** Each green pixel is replicated horizontally to the right edge of the grid. The replication alternates between a green pixel and a blank space (color 0). The green pixel comes first.
4.  **Red Rectangle:** Each red rectangle is replicated vertically downwards. The replication alternates between a full rectangle and a hollow version. The hollow version has the same bounding box, but the center pixels are set to color 0 (blank). The full rectangle comes first.
5.  **Yellow and Blue Pixels and Rectangles:**
   - find the bounding box that contains all yellow and blue objects.
   - replicate yellow and blue, alternating, in a complex diagonal shape until the bounding box is filled.
   - if a blue rectangle exists, replicate it vertically downward, inserting an empty row between.
6.  **Magenta Shapes:** Replicate diagonally.
7. **Gray Shapes:** Gray objects remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
