objects:
  primary:
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        color: non-black, non-zero
        isolated: true  # Indicates if the pixel is not directly adjacent to another pixel of the same color
  secondary:
      - type: line
        properties:
          orientation: ["horizontal", "vertical"]
          color: same as primary pixel
          length: 3

rules:
  - condition: primary pixel has no immediate same-color neighbors horizontally
    action: create secondary object, vertical line, centered on primary pixel
  - condition: primary pixel has no immediate same-color neighbors vertically
    action: create secondary object, horizontal line, centered on primary pixel
