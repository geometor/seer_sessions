Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize on how to improve the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code attempts to identify objects (contiguous regions of non-zero pixels) and apply transformations based on their color. The transformations include mirroring (for azure, green, and red) and some form of replication or expansion (for yellow, red, and blue). Gray objects are correctly identified and left unchanged. However, the code fails to correctly reproduce the expected outputs for all three training examples. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incomplete Mirroring/Replication Rules:** The mirroring logic is too simplistic. It only mirrors individual pixels across the vertical axis of the entire grid, not within the object's bounding box or relative to the object's center. It does not reproduce green correctly.
2.  **Incorrect Expansion/Replication:** The "expansion" logic for red, blue and some colors is ad-hoc and tied to specific pixel coordinates. This is not a generalizable rule. Yellow should become lines, but are only partially applied.
3.  Missing diagonal expansion of red and blue in examples 2.
4.  Missing handling of some colors.
5. Missing handling of additional objects of the same color (example 3)

The strategy to address these issues will involve:

1.  **Refine Object Representation:** Instead of just storing pixel coordinates, store more information about each object, such as its bounding box (min/max row and column) or centroid.
2.  **Generalized Mirroring:** Implement mirroring relative to the object, consider both vertical and horizontal mirroring.
3.  **Generalized Replication:** Develop more robust rules for replication/expansion that are based on object properties, not fixed coordinates.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code after each change to the rules, focusing on one color/transformation at a time.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including specific observations and discrepancies:

## Example 1

*   **Input:** Azure and green objects are present on the right side of the output
*   **Expected Output:** The azure and green objects should be mirrored across the vertical axis and the red object should be expanded horizontally and vertically.
*   **Actual Output:** The mirroring is applied across the grid's vertical axis, not the object's. Red is not expanded.
*   **Discrepancies:** Mirroring location is incorrect. Expansion is incomplete.

## Example 2

*   **Input:** Contains a yellow pixel, a blue cluster, and a red cluster.
*   **Expected Output:**  Yellow forms vertical lines. Red and blue expand around existing pixels.
*   **Actual Output:** Yellow lines are incomplete, and red and blue replication logic is only partially applied.
*   **Discrepancies:** Yellow transformation partially correct. red and blue replication incomplete

## Example 3

*   **Input:** Has multiple, separated, objects of magenta and blue.
*   **Expected Output:** Each magenta should mirror, each blue should replicate.
*   **Actual Output:** Magenta does not mirror correctly. Blue replication logic not applied.
*   **Discrepancies:** Magenta mirror incorrect. Blue logic not applied.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of non-black pixels. Each region is an "object." Record the color, bounding box and location of each object.
2.  **Gray Objects:** Gray objects remain unchanged.
3.  **Yellow Objects:** Transform each yellow pixel into a vertical line of 3 yellow pixels centered on the original pixel.
4.  **Azure and Green Objects:** Mirror each azure and green object across the vertical axis of the grid.
5.  **Magenta Objects:** Mirror each magenta object across the vertical axis of the grid.
6.  **Red Objects:** reflect red objects across the vertical axis, and, for all original pixels, extend the red object vertically down and up.
7.  **Blue Objects:** extend blue color to form 3x3 blocks.
8. **Multiple objects of the same color**: If there are multiple objects of the same color, apply rule to all objects.

This program aims for clarity and conciseness, separating the object identification from the transformation rules. It uses more descriptive terms (vertical line, reflect) and explicitly states the unchanged nature of gray objects.
