objects:
  - name: seed_pattern
    description: The smallest repeating unit in the input grid.
    properties:
      - contains: All non-white pixels in a contiguous block.
      - replication_method: Tiling, both horizontally and vertically.
      - shape: Variable, defined by the arrangement of non-white pixels.
      - size: Bounding box of the non-white pixels in seed_pattern.
  - name: grid
    description: The entire input/output array.
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - cell_values: Integers representing colors (0-9).
      - replication: the seed_pattern is repeated within this grid, with rows x columns as boundaries.
