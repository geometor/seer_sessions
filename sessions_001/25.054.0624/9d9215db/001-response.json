The input grid seems sparse, with mostly white (0) pixels and a few colored pixels (blue (1), red (2), and azure (8)). The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion or replication of the non-white pixels in the input grid. The pattern seems to maintain the relative positions of the original colored pixels but expands them, primarily with blue(1) pixels, creating a checkered or alternating pattern.  Red(2) pixels from input remain, but their relative position in the output can change. Azure (8) also remains.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The replicated blue pixels should occupy positions where the sum of the row and column indices, relative to original blue pixel, have the same parity (both even or both odd).\n\n3. **Maintain other color position:** Leave the Azure (8) and Red (2) pixels in place, matching original input.\n\n4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining empty cells with white (0).\n"
