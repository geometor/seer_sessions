Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy was partially correct in identifying the key roles of different colored pixels (blue, green, yellow). The mirroring of green and yellow was a correct observation, but the implementation has an issue in applying mirror to the original coordinate instead of new coordinate. The blue pixel expansion was also partially correct, but the implementation failed to correctly account for the boundaries created by the mirrored green and yellow pixels, and also expands blue incorrectly in the original row, it should expand from edge-to-edge, using other colors as boundaries. The expansion is also not symmetrical.

The core issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Blue Expansion:** The blue expansion logic doesn't respect mirrored yellow/green pixels as boundaries, leading to over-expansion. The original row expansion calculation is also off.
2.  **Mirror application**: applying the mirror to input coordinates and not applying to potentially changed coordinates.
3.  **Asymmetrical Expansion:** The blue needs to expand to the edges, top, bottom, left, and right.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Fix Mirroring:** ensure mirror operation is idempotent - i.e. applying the operation repeatedly will not change the result.
2.  **Refine Blue Expansion:** Modify the blue expansion to stop at colored pixel boundaries (including the mirrored ones). Calculate the distances to the edges correctly for the horizontal expansion in the original row, then on other rows use the same column range.
3.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the updated logic after each change on all examples to ensure improvements and catch regressions.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

I will use print statements within a `get_metrics` function to avoid re-running costly operations in the original `transform` function, leveraging the `get_non_white_pixels` helper function.

```python
import numpy as np

def get_non_white_pixels(grid):
    """Finds coordinates of non-white pixels."""
    coords = np.argwhere(grid != 0)
    return [tuple(coord) for coord in coords]

def get_metrics(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Analyzes the transformation results."""

    input_non_white = get_non_white_pixels(input_grid)
    expected_non_white = get_non_white_pixels(expected_output)
    transformed_non_white = get_non_white_pixels(transformed_output)

    print("Input Non-White Pixels:", input_non_white)
    print("Expected Non-White Pixels:", expected_non_white)
    print("Transformed Non-White Pixels:", transformed_non_white)

    input_colors = [input_grid[r, c] for r, c in input_non_white]
    expected_colors = [expected_output[r, c] for r, c in expected_non_white]
    transformed_colors = [transformed_output[r, c] for r, c in transformed_non_white]

    print("Input Colors:", input_colors)
    print("Expected Colors:", expected_colors)
    print("Transformed Colors:", transformed_colors)
