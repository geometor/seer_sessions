Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to identify two specific colored objects (azure and red), crop them, resize them to 8x8, and overlay them, prioritizing azure. This approach worked partially for the first example but failed on the subsequent examples. The errors indicate a few key issues:

1.  **Incorrect Object Identification:** The code assumes only two objects of specific colors (azure and red) will be present. Example 2 has a blue object (color 1) and example 3 has a yellow object (color 4) that was not handled. The assumption azure is always overlayed is also clearly wrong.
2.  **Rigid Output Size:** The code is hardcoded to an 8x8 output. The expected outputs for examples 2 and 3 have different dimensions.
3.  **Incorrect Overlay Logic**: Simply finding bounding boxes and resizing is creating several pixel mismatches. It needs a strategy to maintain spatial information from input and apply to the output.

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Flexible Object Detection:** Instead of looking for specific colors, we need to detect *all* distinct objects in the input grid, regardless of their color.
2.  **Dynamic Output Size:** The output grid size should be determined from the examples, not hardcoded.
3. **Relative Positioning:** Use coordinate information to map from the input to the output, maintaining the position.
4. **Proportional Resizing and Overlaying:** Consider not only the individual objects' bounding boxes, but position of colored pixels relative to the output size.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including error analysis:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Size: 21x21
    *   Output Size: 8x8
    *   Objects Detected: Red (2), Azure (8)
    *   Error: 19 pixels mismatch. The resizing and overlaying logic distorted the shapes and relative positions of the objects.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Size: 22x19
    *   Output Size: 5x5
    *   Objects Detected: Red (2), Blue (1)
    *    Error: `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`. This likely occurred because the code tried to find an azure object (color 8), which wasn't present, resulting in `find_object` returning `None`. The main issue is the fixed output size of the function.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Size: 24x21
    *   Output Size: 11x11
    *   Objects Detected: Red (2), Yellow (4)
    *   Error: `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`. Similar to Example 2, the code failed to handle the yellow object and the expected output size.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Output Size:** Determine the dimensions (height and width) of the output grid from the provided output example.
2.  **Identify Colored Objects:** Find all distinct colored regions (objects) within the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
3.  **Process Each Object**: For each color found in the input, find the position of each pixel.
4.  **Resize and Overlay:** Map all colored pixels from the input to the output, maintaining the relative positions.

This program addresses the issues identified earlier: it handles multiple objects of different colors, adapts to the output size, and preserves relative positions. It effectively describes a process of identifying regions of color and proportionally mapping them onto an output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
