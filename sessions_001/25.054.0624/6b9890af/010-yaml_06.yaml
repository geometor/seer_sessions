observations:
  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: 8 #azure
        shape: L-shape
        position: top-left
        size: 5 # pixels (estimated)
      - color: 2 # red
        shape: rectangle + vertical line
        position: center-left
        size: 16 # pixels
    output_objects:
      - color: 8
        shape: 2x2 square inside a frame of 2
        position: center of 8x8
        size: 4
      - color: 2
        shape: Frame around azure square
        position: outer edges
        size: calculated by frame
    transformation: |
       The azure L-shape is converted into a 2x2 square and moved.
       The red object is simplified into a frame around the azure, maintaining its relative position.

  - example: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: 2  # red
        shape: rectangle + vertical line
        position: top-left
        size: 11
      - color: 1 # blue
        shape: small L
        position: center
        size: 3
    output_objects:
        - color: 2
          shape: frame
          position: outer edges
          size: calc by frame
        - color: 1
          shape: 2 x 2
          position: center
    transformation: |
      The blue L object in the center becomes a 2x2 square.
      The red object is simplified into a frame, maintaining relative position.
  - example: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: 2 # red
        shape: rectangle + vertical line
        position: top-left
        size: 22 # pixels
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        shape: small L
        position: bottom-right
        size: 3
    output_objects:
      - color: 2
        shape: frame
        size: calc by frame
      - color: 4
        shape: 3 x 3 cross, center empty, surrounded by 4
        position: Center
    transformation: |
       Yellow L object in bottom right becomes 3x3 cross and moved to center. The cross consists of the center pixel removed, and the remaining pixels surrounded by pixels of the same color.
       The red object is simplified into a frame, maintaining its position.

general_transformation: |
  1.  Identify "L-shaped" objects composed of 3 pixels.
  2.  Transform these L-shapes:
      a. If Azure, create a 2x2 Azure square in the center.
      b. If Blue, create a 2x2 Blue square in the center.
      c. If Yellow, create a 3x3 cross where the center pixel is blank (0), and the remaining cross pixels are surrounded by pixels of the same color.
  3. Find large shapes on left, convert to a frame.
