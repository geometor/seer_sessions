Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The input grid appears to have two distinct rectangular shapes, one outlined in red (value 2) and another smaller shape in yellow (value 4). The output grid seems to be a condensed and modified version of the input, retaining elements of both shapes. The output is significantly smaller than the input. Specifically, it appears to be made of just the outlines of a rectangle.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
