The output is a smaller grid (8x8) that appears to be a cropped and combined representation of the two objects from the input, overlaid on each other. The red square from the input forms the outer border of the output grid, while the azure shape is placed in the center. Where the colors overlap, the azure (8) takes priority. Areas outside of any colored region in the result remain white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The cropping boundary in input includes all parts of both shapes.\n3.  **Overlay Objects:** Create an 8x8 output grid.\n4.  **Draw Red Square:** Copy the pixels of the cropped red square into the output grid, maintaining relative positions.\n5.  **Draw Azure Shape:** Copy the pixels of the cropped azure shape into the output grid, maintaining relative positions.\n6. **Color Priority:** if there is any pixel with overlapping colors, copy the pixel value of azure shape.\n7.  **Background:** Any remaining pixels in the output grid that were not part of either object are set to white (0).\n\nIn essence, the program crops the relevant objects from the input grid, overlays them onto a new 8x8 grid with a defined color priority, and sets any remaining background pixels to white.\n"
