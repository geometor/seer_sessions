            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the two key objects: a red rectangle outline and a smaller, filled yellow rectangle. It attempts to combine them by placing the yellow rectangle inside the top border of the red outline. However, the positioning and sizing logic is flawed, especially concerning the yellow rectangle. It doesn't always maintain the yellow rectangle shape (example 2) and incorrectly places and stretches it in relation to the red outline. The main issue is incorrect placement and distortion of inner shape after correctly drawing the outer red outline shape.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current object identification (especially for outlines) is overly complex. We should simplify it.\n2.  **Improve Placement Logic:** The yellow rectangle needs to be placed *relative* to the red rectangle's top-left corner, but *inside* the outline.\n3.  **Preserve Shape:** Ensure the yellow rectangle's dimensions are preserved. The current code sometimes stretches inner shape and sometimes not.\n4. Simplify - avoid the complex outline detection and work from bounding box coordinates\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_grid_shape: [19, 21]\n    output_grid_shape: [8, 8]\n    red_outline:\n      present: true\n      is_outline: true\n      color: 2\n      bounding_box: [[7, 6], [14, 13]]  # [top-left, bottom-right]\n    yellow_rectangle:\n      present: true\n      is_outline: false\n      color: 4\n      bounding_box: [[2,6],[4,8]]   # Example values\n    transformation:\n      - action: combine\n      - object1: red_outline\n      - object2: yellow_rectangle\n      - placement_rule: \"yellow rectangle placed inside the top border of red outline\"\n      - size_change: output size determined by red outline, reduced\n    match: false\n    notes: >\n      The code fails to place the yellow rectangle correctly, draws at input coordinates, and gets output size of the red rectangle correctly.\n      The yellow rectangle is stretched.\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_grid_shape: [19, 22]\n    output_grid_shape: [5, 5]\n    red_outline:\n      present: true\n      is_outline: true\n      color: 2\n      bounding_box: [[2, 2], [6, 6]]\n    yellow_rectangle:\n      present: true\n      is_outline: false\n      color: 1\n      bounding_box: [[9,10],[11,12]]\n    transformation:\n      - action: combine\n      - object1: red_outline\n      - object2: yellow_rectangle\n      - placement_rule: \"yellow rectangle placed inside the top border of red outline\"\n    match: false\n    notes:  The code fails to produce the correct shape and size.

Height of inner object changes relative to outer.\"\n    match: false\n    notes: The result draws at red box coordinates, but the inner rectangle is not properly positioned or sized.\n    size_change: output size determined by red outline, reduced\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Red Rectangle Outline:** Find the bounding box of the largest red (color 2) rectangle outline in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify the Inner Filled Rectangle:** Find the bounding box of the smaller, filled rectangle of any color other than red within the input grid.\n3. **Determine output grid:** Create a new grid based on the dimensions (width and height) of the red rectangle's bounding box\n4.  **Draw Red Outline:** Draw the red rectangle outline onto the new grid. The outline occupies the entire border of the output grid.\n5.  **Draw Inner Rectangle:** Draw the filled inner-colored rectangle inside the red outline.\n    *   The top edge of the inner rectangle should be one pixel below the top edge of the red outline.\n    *   The left edge of the inner rectangle should be one pixel to the right of the red outline's left edge\n    *   Stretch the inner rectangle horizontally to fit the width of the red outline, minus 2 (to account for the left and right borders of the outline). The height remains the same.\n\nEssentially, the output grid's size is determined by the red outline, the red outline is drawn first, and then the filled rectangle, resized to fit *inside* the red outline horizontally, is placed just below the top border.\n"
