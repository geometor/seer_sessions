The primary colors involved are red (2) and white/background (0).  The output introduces a new color, green (3). It appears a large rectangular block of green replaces a significant portion of the white background. The red pixels seem to define the boundary or trigger area for the green fill.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
