examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - color: 8 # Azure
        description: Multiple, disconnected regions, one large rectangular region in the top-left.
        stripe_significance: The rightmost edge of the largest azure object seems to define the transformation region.
    transformation:
      - type: color_region
        start_column: "right edge of significant azure object + 1"
        color: 3 # Green
        region: "All pixels to the right of start_column"

  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - color: 1 # Blue
        description: One large, irregular, connected region and a few isolated pixels.
        stripe_significance: The rightmost continuous vertical edge of the largest blue object.
    transformation:
      - type: color_region
        start_column: "right edge of significant blue object + 1"
        color: 3 # Green
        region: "All pixels to the right of start_column"

  - example_id: 3
    objects:
      - color: 2
        description:  Multiple disconnected regions of red (objects)
        stripe_significance: The transformation does *not* start from the right. The left-most columns are changed.
    transformation:
      - type: color_region
        start_column: "left most column - find longest object"
        color: 3
        region: "right of significant object, up to first black object"
