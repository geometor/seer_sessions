The cross can be any color, and the lines must intersect at the center. The cross may have a thickness greater than 1.\n2.  **Determine Cross Interior:** The spaces within the arms of the \"X\" are considered the interior.\n3.  **Recolor Cross Interior:** Change the color of the pixels *inside* the cross (excluding the outline) to yellow (color 4).\n4.  **Recolor Background in Proximity to Cross Outline:**\n    -   Identify the outline of the cross.  The outline consists of the outermost pixels of the cross.\n    -   Identify cells adjacent to the cross outline (Manhattan distance of 1).\n    -   Change the color of these adjacent background pixels to green (color 3).\n5.  **Recolor Remaining Background:** Change the color of the remaining background pixels (those not adjacent to the cross outline, and not part of the cross) to yellow (color 4).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Detects distinct objects in the grid.
