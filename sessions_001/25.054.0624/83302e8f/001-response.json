The input grid appears to have a pattern of azure (8) and white (0) pixels, forming a slanted cross or \"X\" shape. The output grid maintains the same shape but recolors some of the white pixels to green(3) and some azure pixels to yellow(4). The white background pixels surrounding the shape appears to transform to green and yellow diagonally and symmetrically.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
