The primary colors observed are white (0), maroon (9), yellow (4), and green (3). The transformation appears to involve changing some, but not all, of the white (0) pixels to either yellow (4) or green (3). The maroon (9) pixels seem to act as some kind of boundary or marker, and their positions remain constant between the input and output. The overall shape formed by maroon pixels also remains the same. There are two different connected regions of white pixels which have different replacement colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
