The boundary must form a closed loop or connect edges to other edges.\n3.  **Identify all horizontal lines:** Find all horizontal lines where every cell is equal 'c'.\n4.  **Determine fill color:**\n    *   For regions located *above* the *topmost* horizontal line, fill with green (3).\n    *   For regions located *between* horizontal lines, fill with yellow (4)\n    * For regions *below* the *bottom most* horizontal line, fill the with yellow(4).\n5.  **Preserve Boundary Lines:** Maintain the color 'c' pixels in their original positions.\n6. **Consider other colors.** The region may contain pixels that are not 0. These must be detected by the flood fill and correctly filled.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_boundary_lines(grid, boundary_color=1):\n    # Find the coordinates of all boundary pixels.\n    return np.where(grid == boundary_color)\n\ndef is_enclosed(grid, coord, boundary_color=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given coordinate is within an enclosed region, improved.\n    Uses a flood-fill algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    x, y = coord\n\n    # If the starting coordinate is boundary_color, it's not enclosed.\n    if grid[x, y] == boundary_color:\n        return False\n\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(x, y)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        curr_x, curr_y = queue.pop(0)\n\n        if (curr_x, curr_y) in visited:\n            continue\n        visited.add((curr_x, curr_y))\n\n        # If we hit a boundary, it's not enclosed.\n        if curr_x == 0 or curr_x == rows - 1 or curr_y == 0 or curr_y == cols - 1:\n            if grid[curr_x, curr_y] != boundary_color:\n              return False\n\n        # Check neighbors\n        neighbors = [\n            (curr_x - 1, curr_y),\n            (curr_x + 1, curr_y),\n            (curr_x, curr_y - 1),\n            (curr_x, curr_y + 1),\n        ]\n\n        for nx, ny in neighbors:\n            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols:\n                if grid[nx, ny] != boundary_color and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n    return True\n\ndef find_all_horizontal_lines(grid, boundary_color=1):\n     rows, cols = grid.shape\n     horizontal_lines = []\n     for r in range(rows):\n        if all(grid[r,c] == boundary_color for c in range(cols)):\n            horizontal_lines.append(r)\n     return horizontal_lines\n\ndef transform(input_grid, boundary_color = 1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the described rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    boundary_lines = find_boundary_lines(input_grid, boundary_color)\n    boundary_lines_set = set(zip(boundary_lines[0], boundary_lines[1]))\n\n    horizontal_lines = find_all_horizontal_lines(input_grid, boundary_color)\n\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r,c) not in boundary_lines_set:\n                if is_enclosed(input_grid, (r, c), boundary_color):\n                    if not horizontal_lines: #no horizontal lines\n                        output_grid[r,c] = 3 #default to color above\n                    elif r < horizontal_lines[0]:\n                        output_grid[r,c] = 3\n                    elif r > horizontal_lines[-1]:\n                         output_grid[r,c] = 4\n                    else: #between lines\n                        for i in range(len(horizontal_lines) - 1):\n                            if horizontal_lines[i] < r < horizontal_lines[i+1]:\n                                output_grid[r,c] = 4\n                                break\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
