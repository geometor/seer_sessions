The most noticeable change is the removal of certain pixels, specifically the white (0) pixels. It seems like the transformation aims to eliminate, or \"clear\", specific regions within the input grid. The remaining colors and their arrangement seem largely preserved, except where affected by the removal of the white pixels. There appears to be a shape formed by the white pixels which is getting selectively removed.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
