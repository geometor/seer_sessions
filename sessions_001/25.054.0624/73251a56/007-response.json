These regions seem to be defined by connected areas of the color black (0). The output grid retains the overall structure and most of the colors of the input grid, but the identified black regions are replaced with the surrounding predominant color, in this case, gray (5). The overall transformation appears to simplify the image by reducing noise or less significant regions.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
