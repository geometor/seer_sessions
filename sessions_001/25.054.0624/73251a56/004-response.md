"""
1. Identify Colored Regions: Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. These form the boundaries of potential shapes.
2. Identify White Regions: Locate all groups of connected white (0) pixels.
3. Determine Enclosure: For each `white_region`,
    - Inspect the neighbors of each white pixel.
    - If all neighbors are either the same white pixel or a boundary of non-white, and has at least one non-white neighbor, it is determined to be enclosed by a colored region.
4. Remove Enclosed White Regions: Change the color value of all pixels in enclosed white regions to 1 (blue) to match training output examples.
5. Retain Other Pixels: All other pixels (non-white and white pixels not part of enclosed regions) remain unchanged.
