Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are grids of colored pixels. The most noticeable change is the removal of certain pixels, specifically the white (0) pixels. It seems like the transformation aims to eliminate, or "clear", specific regions within the input grid. The remaining colors and their arrangement seem largely preserved, except where affected by the removal of the white pixels. There appears to be a shape formed by the white pixels which is getting selectively removed.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 21x21
      - elements: pixels
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Values representing different colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: remove_pixels
    target: pixels
    condition:
      - color: 0 # White
      - shape: specific_pattern # To be defined more precisely

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains pixels.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Regions:** Locate all white (0) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Selective Removal:** Remove only those white pixels that form an enclosed shape. More precisely, if a shape formed of white pixels have at least one other colored pixel adjacent to the white pixel, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those white pixels are removed.
3. Retain all other color and white pixels as they appear in the input grid.

In essence, the transformation "clears" white-colored enclosed areas in the input image while keeping all other regions intact.
