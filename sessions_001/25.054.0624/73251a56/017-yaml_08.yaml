examples:
  - example_id: 1
    objects:
      - description: Large, irregular blobs of various colors.
        properties:
          colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
          adjacency: Colors are directly adjacent (horizontally and vertically).
          background: White (0) fills the spaces between colored blobs.
    actions:
      - type: Color spread
        description: White pixels adjacent to colored pixels change color.
        constraints:
          - The specific color chosen isn't consistent across all white pixels.
          -  It's not the first, it seems somewhat arbitrary or based on hidden logic

  - example_id: 2
    objects:
      - description: Similar to example 1, irregular blobs of various colors.
        properties:
          colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
          adjacency: Colors are directly adjacent.
          background: White (0)
    actions:
       - type: Color spread
         description: White pixels adjacent to colored pixels change color.
         constraints:
           - The specific color chosen isn't consistent across all white pixels.

  - example_id: 3
    objects:
      - description: Irregular blobs of various colors
        properties:
          colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
          adjacency: Colors are directly adjacent.
          background: White (0)
    actions:
      - type: Color spread
        description: White pixels adjacent to colored pixels change color
        constraints:
          - The specific color chosen isn't consistent across all white pixels.

general_observations:
  - The transformation rule is not a simple "first neighbor" contagion.
  - The direction of color spread, if any, is not clear.
  -  There may be multiple "layers" that spread from.
