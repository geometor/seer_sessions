Contains a central \"object\" composed of connected 1 (blue) and 4 (yellow) pixels. The yellow pixels are fully enclosed by the blue pixels.\n*   **Output:** A 17x15 grid, same dimensions as the input. The central object is mostly preserved, except where modifications are apparent, the yellow parts are changed in color. There is a 3 pixels vertical line of color yellow and the number 4 added on the either sides of the central blue shape, where the borders are white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
