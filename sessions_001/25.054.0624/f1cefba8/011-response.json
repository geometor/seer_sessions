            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and focused on identifying a \"central object,\" preserving its horizontal component, extending vertical lines with yellow, and modifying borders. The subsequent tests reveal that this approach is too specific and doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issue is that the \"central object\" concept and the specific transformations applied are not universally applicable. The expected outputs show a more complex pattern involving mirroring, changing colors based on position and neighboring colors, and conditional transformations. The current strategy is not sufficient to address the variety shown in the examples. We need to shift our approach from focusing on pre-defined object to recognizing patterns and applying the changes based on observation of patterns, not expectations.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Abandon the \"central object\" concept:** The current approach is too rigid. Instead, focus on identifying *all* objects and their properties (color, position, shape) and their neighbor pixels.\n2.  **Analyze relative positions:** The transformations seem to depend on the relative positions of pixels and objects. Consider relationships like \"above,\" \"below,\" \"left,\" \"right,\" and \"adjacent.\"\n3.  **Conditional Transformations:** The color changes are likely conditional, based on the original color and the colors of neighboring pixels, or position in the array. Identify these conditions.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with simple observations and gradually build a more complex rule set, testing each rule against all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_grid_size: [19, 13]\n    output_grid_size: [19, 13]\n    input_colors: [0, 2, 8]\n    output_colors: [0, 2, 8]\n    transform_match: False\n    pixels_off: 65\n    notes: >\n      The initial code failed to correctly mirror the red '2' pixels across the central\n      azure '8' object and its horizontal line. Also, added red '2' to the edge on row 7.\n      The approach of extending lines with yellow '4' is completely wrong.\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_grid_size: [17, 17]\n    output_grid_size: [17, 17]\n    input_colors: [0, 1, 4]\n    output_colors: [0, 1, 4]\n    transform_match: False\n    pixels_off: 63\n    notes: >\n        The transformation involves both mirroring the '4' pixels above and below the\n        central blue '1' structure, and some form of edge modification involving the\n        '4' pixels. Yellow '4' is also added on row 8, columns 1,2,14,15,16.\n  - example_id: 3\n    input_grid_size: [16, 18]\n    output_grid_size: [16, 18]\n    input_colors: [0, 2, 3]\n    output_colors: [0, 2, 3]\n    transform_match: False\n    pixels_off: 57\n    notes: >\n      Mirroring of '3' pixels seems to occur across the long axis of a shape of 2's.\n      The code added some yellow incorrectly. Also, added maroon '3' to the edge on\n      row 9.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program (Revised):**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-white (non-zero) pixels. Each block is an object.\n2. **Find Object horizontal axis:** Find the row with most object color, consider this the axis.\n3.  **Mirror:** For each object, mirror the object pixels above and below the horizontal axis.\n4.  **Edge Modification:**\n    *   If an object has a long horizontal axis:\n       *   Examine the row above and the row below and find pixels that do not match the axis color.\n        *    Change pixel color in output to object color in axis.\n    *    Examine edge columns that have object color:\n        *   Add object color to axis row adjacent to edge.\n\nThis revised program is a significant step towards a more accurate description. It focuses on mirroring and conditional edge modifications, which seem to be key elements of the transformation. It is still incomplete, but it provides a better foundation for further refinement.\n"
