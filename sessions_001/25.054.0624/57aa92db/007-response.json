The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The primary elements are colored \"objects,\" which appear to be contiguous blocks of the same color. The background is consistently white (0). There seem to be distinct, non-overlapping objects of different colors in different locations within the grid. The transformation seems to operate on these objects.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
