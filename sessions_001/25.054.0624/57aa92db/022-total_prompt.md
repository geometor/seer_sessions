1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid. These are our initial objects.
2.  **Green Object Expansion:** The green object expands. If it exists, increase its size by one pixel in all orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right).
3. **Yellow Object Expansion:** If exists, the yellow object will check if red squares are diagonal from it. If so, extend them to down and to the left, filling the area between them.
4.  **Preserve Other Objects:**  All other non-green, non-yellow objects (in this case, the azure and red objects) retain their original shape and position in the output grid.
5.  **Background:** All other pixels (white/0) remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program and code captured some aspects of the transformation but failed to generalize correctly across all examples. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Green Expansion:** The green object expansion is too simple. It expands in all directions regardless of other objects.
2.  **Incorrect Yellow Interaction:** The yellow object's interaction with red is not correctly implemented. The description assumed a diagonal fill, but the actual behavior is more complex.
3. **Incorrect object interaction**: In several of the examples there are interactions that are not being handled correctly.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Object Identification:** Ensure the `find_objects` function correctly identifies all distinct objects, even single-pixel ones.
2.  **Precise Interaction Rules:** Define very specific conditions for how the green and yellow objects interact with others. This includes checking for adjacency (not just general proximity) and specific colors.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Use information from all the examples - modify and describe the program, implement, test, evaluate.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Green 'T', Azure 'I', Yellow 'square', with blue and red pixels.
    *   **Expected Output:** Green expands, Yellow fills an area beside it and connects diagonally.
    *   **Actual Output:** Green expands up, down, left, and right. Yellow fills some, but not all.
    *   **Issues:** Green expansion is too broad. Yellow filling is incorrect.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Azure, Red, Magenta, Green objects.
    *   **Expected Output:** Green expands around the adjacent red, magenta expands.
    *   **Actual Output:** Green only expands around itself. Magenta doesn't get filled.
    *   **Issues:** Green expansion needs to consider adjacent colors. Magenta fill condition not understood.
*   **Example 3:**
    *    **Input**: Blue 'L', Yellow 'square', Azure 'square'.
    *   **Expected output**: Azure expands to fill available horizontal space, yellow expands to fill available vertical space.
    *   **Actual Output**: incorrect expansion and interaction between the yellow and azure.
    *   **Issues**: both yellow and azure object filling is not correct.
*   **Example 4:**
    *    **Input**: green and red pixels, azure, yellow and red squares.
    *   **Expected output**: green expands in one direction adjacent to the red, yellow extends left and down beside and below the red.
    *   **Actual output**: the extensions are in the incorrect place.
    *   **Issues**: the conditions and rules for the green, yellow and red interaction are not correct.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous objects (non-white pixels) in the input grid.
2.  **Green Expansion (Conditional):** If a green object exists, expand it by one pixel *only* in the directions where it is directly adjacent (orthogonally) to another object.
3.  **Yellow Expansion (Conditional):** If a yellow object exists, and it's orthogonally adjacent to a red object to its immediate left, extend left by one. If adjacent and down below, expand down by one.
4. **Magenta Expansion (Conditional)**: If a magenta object exists and there is a red pixel to the immediate NW diagonal, extend left by one and up by one.
5.  **Azure Expansion (Conditional)**: If an azure square is detected and it has space on either of its horizontal sides, expand in both directions.
6.  **Preservation:** All other objects retain their original shape and position.
7.  **Background:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged unless filled by an expanding object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
