            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code had several shortcomings, leading to mismatches in multiple test cases. The core issues stem from:\n\n1.  **Incomplete Conditional Expansion Logic:** The expansion rules for green, yellow, magenta, and azure were not comprehensive enough, and didn't account for all possible scenarios of adjacency and relative positioning.\n2.  **Incorrect Neighbor Handling:** The neighbor checking logic (especially for yellow and magenta) had flaws in determining the precise expansion direction. There was confusion of concepts, like expansion and shifting the colors.\n3. **Azure Expansion**: Azure expansion should be constrained to squares.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Expansion Conditions:** Carefully re-examine each color's expansion rules based on *all* training examples. Pay very close attention to *relative positions* and *adjacency types*.\n2.  **Precise Neighbor Checks:** Use a more structured approach to neighbor checking. Explicitly distinguish between orthogonal and diagonal neighbors, and verify their positions *relative* to the object being expanded.\n3. **Correct Azure Expansion**: Ensure only squares of azure expand and only do so on the left and right.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, highlighting the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Issue:** Yellow expansion near red did not occur. Yellow did not expand adjacent to existing red pixels.\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 12\n    * **Observed behavior:** No expansion of any colors.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Issue:** Green and azure did not extend correctly, and magenta did not expand.\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 12\n    * **Observed behavior**: Incorrect azure expansion to the right. Green did not expand, adjacent to the grey. Magenta had no expansion.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Issue:** Azure expansion was incorrect. Should have expanded on left and right.\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 48\n    * **Observed behavior**: No expansion, except a small, incorrect Azure expansion.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Issue:** Green and yellow did not expand correctly.\n    *   **Pixels Off:** 19\n    *   **Observed behavior**: Yellow expansion did not occur. Green did not expand adjacent to the red. Incorrect azure expansion.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: Green\n    color: 3\n    expansion_rule: \"Expand one pixel orthogonally adjacent to *any* other non-white object.\"\n  - object: Yellow\n    color: 4\n    expansion_rule: \"Expand one pixel in all orthogonal directions adjacent to a red object.\"\n  - object: Magenta\n    color: 6\n    expansion_rule: \"If a red pixel is diagonally NW, expand one pixel left and one pixel up.\"\n  - object: Azure\n    color: 8\n    expansion_rule: \"If the azure object is a square, expand one pixel to the left and one to the right, if the expansion would be onto a white space.\"\n  - object: Other\n    expansion_rule: \"Objects of other colors do not change.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous objects (connected components of non-white pixels) in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Green Expansion:** For each green (color 3) object, expand it by one pixel in all orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) where it is directly adjacent to *any* other non-white colored pixel.\n\n3.  **Yellow Expansion:** For each yellow (color 4) object, expand one pixel orthogonally in any direction where a red object is directly adjacent.\n\n4.  **Magenta Expansion:** For each magenta (color 6) object: if a red pixel exists diagonally up and to the left (NW), expand the magenta object by one pixel to the left and one pixel up.\n\n5. **Azure Expansion:** If there is an Azure colored square, expand one pixel to the left and one to the right.\n\n6.  **Preservation:** All other objects retain their original shape and position.\n\n7.  **Background:** White pixels (0) remain unchanged unless filled by an expanding object.\n"
