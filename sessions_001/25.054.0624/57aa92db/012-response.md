"""
The transformation involves identifying distinct objects in the input grid, grouping them by color, and then potentially creating copies or shifting them based on certain rules. It appears there are specific color combinations that get combined, and objects get shifted, sometimes vertically. The output grid's dimensions can change to accommodate the transformations.
