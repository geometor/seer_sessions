Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), yellow (4), and azure (8). The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: a small blue/yellow structure in the top-left and a larger azure/yellow structure in the bottom-right. The output grid seems to combine and modify these regions. The upper blue shape is unchanged. The lower shape of azure is expanded, and combines the lower shape of yellow.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: shape1
    type: rectangle
    color: blue (1)
    outline_color: blue
    fill_color: 1,4
    position: top-left
    initial_size: 3x3 # approximate, includes the single yellow pixel
    final_size: 3x3
  - id: shape2
    type: rectangle
    color: azure (8)
    outline_color: azure
    fill_color: 8, 4
    position: bottom-right
    initial_size: 3x3 # of 8s and 3x3 of 4s
    final_size: 9x6 # includes internal yellow region

actions:
  - type: maintain
    object: shape1
    description: The blue/yellow shape remains unchanged in position and size.
  - type: expand_and_combine
    object: shape2
    description: >-
        The azure shape expands significantly. The yellow pixels within
        the original azure shape maintain relative positions, but becomes
        surrounded by an azure outline.
        The dimensions of the azure shape are expanded until there are three blank rows
        above, and two blank columns on either side.
        The bottom rows, columns filled with azure until row 15, column 14, inclusively.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: shape1 is above and to the left of shape2 in both input and output.
  - type: containment
    description: Both shapes have yellow (4) pixels within their boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate distinct colored regions in the input grid. We can identify two such regions: a small blue region with a yellow pixel (shape1) and a larger azure region with a yellow region (shape2).

2.  **Maintain Shape 1:** The blue and yellow object (shape1) in the top-left corner is unchanged. Keep its position, size, outline, and internal pixel arrangement.

3.  **Expand and Combine Shape 2:**
    *   Expand the borders of the azure region (shape2).
    *   The amount of expansion is such that the new azure shape is padded with
    empty rows and columns, with 3 empty rows above, two columns on each side, and
    filling the 8s up to and including row 15, column 14.
    *   Maintain the relative position of the internal yellow (4) pixels within the expanded azure region.

In essence, the transformation preserves the smaller blue/yellow structure while substantially expanding and combining the larger azure/yellow structure. The yellow pixels inside the larger structure are 'carried along' during the azure expansion.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
