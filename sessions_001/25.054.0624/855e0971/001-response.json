There are three distinct horizontal bands of color: gray (5) at the top, yellow (4) in the middle, and azure (8) at the bottom.  Within the yellow and azure bands, there are single white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to be related to the vertical position/repetition of these white pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Keep the original white pixel, creating copies in every row of the band in the same column.\n\n4. **Replicate in Azure Band:** For each white pixel in the *azure* band, replicate it vertically downwards within the azure band. Keep the original white pixel, creating copies in every row of the band in the same column.\n\n5. **Assemble:** The grey top band does not change. Combine the (unchanged) top grey band, and transformed yellow and azure bands. This forms the output grid.\n"
