Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output grids consist of pixels with integer values representing colors. The primary colors involved are red (2), blue (1), and white (0).  The input grid has a clear vertical division: a left section of red pixels and a right section of blue pixels.  Within these sections, there are single white pixels. The output grid maintains the same overall structure but modifies the colors of certain pixels based on their surroundings.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 14x13
      - left_region_color: red (2)
      - right_region_color: blue (1)
      - has_white_pixels: true
    relations:
      - left_region: contiguous block of red pixels
      - right_region: contiguous block of blue pixels

  - object: white_pixel
    properties:
      - original_color: white (0)
      - context_dependent_change: true
    actions:
      - changes_to: surrounding_color, based on original location
    locations:
      - input: [(3,2), (11, 8)]
      - output: [(3, 0-4), (11, 5-12)], where ranges show extents of the 'spread'

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** The grid is divided into two main vertical regions: a left region filled with red (2) pixels and a right region filled with blue (1) pixels.

2.  **Locate White Pixels:** Identify the locations of white (0) pixels within the input grid.

3.  **Contextual Color Change:**
    *   If a white pixel is in the red region, change the white pixel and all pixels to its right that is in the red region to white (0).
    *   If a white pixel is on the blue region, change it and all pixels to the left that is within the blue region to white (0).

In short: the white pixels "clear out" their own colored regions to the border. A white pixel in the red region paints all the red to its right, white. A white pixel in the blue region paints everything to its left, white.
