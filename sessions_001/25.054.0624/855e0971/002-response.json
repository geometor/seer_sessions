Keep the original white pixel, creating copies in every row of the band in the same column.\n\n4. **Replicate in Azure Band:** For each white pixel in the *azure* band, replicate it vertically downwards within the azure band. Keep the original white pixel, creating copies in every row of the band in the same column.\n\n5. **Assemble:** The grey top band does not change.
