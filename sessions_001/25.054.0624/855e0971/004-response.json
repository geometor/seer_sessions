The number of bands and their colors can vary.\n\n2.  **Find White Pixel Columns:** Iterate through all rows *except* those belonging to the top band (which often remains unchanged, though its color isn't consistently grey). For each row, identify the *columns* that contain white (0) pixels.\n\n3.  **Replicate in Non-Top Bands:** For *every* row that is *not* in the top band, set the pixel to white (0) in *all* columns identified in step 2.\n\n4.  **Assemble Output:** Combine all rows. The final output will consist of the (potentially unchanged) top band, followed by the modified lower bands where the white pixels have been replicated downwards within their respective column across all non-grey band rows.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # 1.
