The primary colors involved are red (2), blue (1), and white (0).  The input grid has a clear vertical division: a left section of red pixels and a right section of blue pixels.  Within these sections, there are single white pixels. The output grid maintains the same overall structure but modifies the colors of certain pixels based on their surroundings.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A white pixel in the red region paints all the red to its right, white. A white pixel in the blue region paints everything to its left, white.\n"
