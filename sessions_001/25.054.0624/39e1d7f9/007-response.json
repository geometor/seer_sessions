The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. There are several distinct regions of color:\n\n*   **Background:** White (0) and Green (3)\n*   **Shapes:**  Yellow (4), Magenta (6)\n\nThe primary change appears to involve some kind of translation/shifting, maybe based on other colored shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
