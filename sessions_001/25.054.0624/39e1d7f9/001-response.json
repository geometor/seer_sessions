These digits correspond to different colors. The input and output grids appear to be the same size (24x25). The most obvious change between input and output seems to be a color swap between magenta (6) and green(3) at specific locations. The backgrounds, and lines composed of white, blue, gray, and maroon appear identical, but the green and magenta objects are different.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
