            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was a very basic attempt to locate the positions of green (3) and magenta (6) pixels. It correctly identifies their locations, but it doesn't perform any transformation. The \"Expected Output\" is identical to the \"Input\", revealing that the core transformation logic is completely missing.  The provided example and results don't give us much to work with, other than exposing the lack of any actual transformation. The example input grid show vertical columns of green and magenta that alternate. The bottom right quadrant gets updated so that magenta is now where green was.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Multiple Examples:** We need to analyze all the training examples to understand the rule. A single, unchanged input-output pair is insufficient. I expect a pattern of swapping colors in specific regions or based on certain conditions.\n2.  **Identify Objects and Actions:**  We need to move beyond just finding pixel positions. We need to identify *objects* (contiguous regions of the same color) and describe how those objects are *transformed* (moved, recolored, resized, etc.). The provided code only identifies locations of green and magenta; it doesn't relate them.\n3. **Focus on relative position and adjacencies:** Use observation of relative positions, adjacencies, counts and object attributes to determine relationships\n\n**Metrics and Reports (using code execution, conceptual for now):**\n\nSince the provided code output is just printed positions, and the input/output are identical, standard metrics like pixel accuracy are meaningless at this stage. We will get this information by looking at the example itself:\n\nExample Input:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nExample Output:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3]]\n```\n\n- Find the bounding box of the columns in the top left, then the bottom right, then swap.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  -
