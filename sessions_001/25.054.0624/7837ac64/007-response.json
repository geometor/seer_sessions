There are a few distinct, isolated pixels of red (2) and azure (8). The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing only white (0), red (2), and azure (8) pixels. It appears the output grid is a highly reduced representation of the input, retaining only the non-green and non-white colors, and their relative positions seem to correspond to locations in the larger input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, find the red (2) and azure (8) pixels.\n2. **Extreme Down-sampling:** Create a new, much smaller 3x3 grid.\n3. **Map and reconstruct (condense):** Place the identified non-green, non-white colors (red and azure) into the new grid, maintaining approximate relative positioning from input. The other cells are filled with white (0). Because the grid has been reduced, the location is based on groups of 9 input cells.\n\nIn essence, the transformation filters out the dominant colors (green and white), and creates a drastically reduced \"map\" of the remaining colors' locations. The size reduction to 3x3 appears to be fixed in this instance.\n"
