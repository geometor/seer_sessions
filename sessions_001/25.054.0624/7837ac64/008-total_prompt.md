Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (27x27) primarily composed of green (3) and white (0) pixels.  There are a few distinct, isolated pixels of red (2) and azure (8). The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing only white (0), red (2), and azure (8) pixels. It appears the output grid is a highly reduced representation of the input, retaining only the non-green and non-white colors, and their relative positions seem to correspond to locations in the larger input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 27x27
    elements:
      - color: green
        value: 3
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: red
        value: 2
      - color: azure
        value: 8
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: red
        value: 2
      - color: azure
        value: 8

actions:
 - type: filter
   description: Remove all green and white pixels from the input grid.

 - type: condense
   description: Reduce the size of filtered grid, retaining relative color placement, producing the small grid.

relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: The positions of the red and azure pixels in the output grid roughly correspond to their positions in the input grid, after accounting for the extreme size reduction.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify and Isolate:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels that are *not* green (3) or white (0). In this case, find the red (2) and azure (8) pixels.
2. **Extreme Down-sampling:** Create a new, much smaller 3x3 grid.
3. **Map and reconstruct (condense):** Place the identified non-green, non-white colors (red and azure) into the new grid, maintaining approximate relative positioning from input. The other cells are filled with white (0). Because the grid has been reduced, the location is based on groups of 9 input cells.

In essence, the transformation filters out the dominant colors (green and white), and creates a drastically reduced "map" of the remaining colors' locations. The size reduction to 3x3 appears to be fixed in this instance.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
