examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: 4  # Yellow
        shape: Vertical lines and large block
      - color: 1  # Blue
        shape: Scattered pixels within the yellow block
      - color: 3  # Green
        shape: Scattered pixels within the yellow block
    output_objects:
      - color: 1
        relative_position: top-left
      - color: 3
        relative_position: top-right
    transformation: Downsample to 3x3, preserve relative positions of non-white colors.
    notes: The output seems to pick specific non-white and non-background colors, and place some of them in the top row.

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: 3  # Green
        shape: Vertical lines and background fill
      - color: 2  # Red
        shape: Scattered pixels within green areas
      - color: 8  # Azure
        shape: Scattered pixels within green areas
    output_objects:
      - color: 2  # red
        relative_position: top-center and middle-left
      - color: 8
        relative_position: bottom-right
    transformation: Downsample to 3x3, focus on red and azure.
    notes: output contains correct color.

  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: 1
        shape: Vertical Lines
      - color: 6
        shape: Isolated pixels
      - color: 3
        shape: isolated pixels
    output_objects:
      - color: 6
        relative_position: top row
      - color: 3
        relative_position: bottom row
    transformation: Downsample to 3x3 grid focusing on colors 3 and 6. The top row contains 6s, and the bottom row contains 3s. The middle row is all white (0).
    notes: output is not just positioning of the objects, but entire rows of the output are a single color

  - example_id: 4
    input_objects:
     - color: 8
       shape: Vertical Lines, background
     - color: 1
       shape: scattered pixels
     - color: 2
       shape: scattered pixels
    output_objects:
      - color: 1
        relative_position: Top-left
      - color: 2
        relative_position: all other positions
    transformation: Downsample to a 3x3. Colors 1 and 2 are present, with color 2 taking the most area.
    notes: output is not just positioning of the objects, but entire rows of the output are a single color
