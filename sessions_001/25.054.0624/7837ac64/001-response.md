Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input appears to be a large, complex grid composed of mostly yellow (4) and white (0) pixels, with a few instances of blue (1), and green (3). The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing only blue (1), white (0), and green (3). The output seems to be a highly abstracted representation of the input, focusing on a very specific subset of colors and possibly their relative positioning. It is as if, the output grid is summarizing key color features in the source.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Large grid with various pixel colors.
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1, 3, 4] # white, blue, green, yellow

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Small grid representing a transformation of the input grid.
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1, 3] # white, blue, green
      dimensions: [3, 3]

actions:
 - name: extract_colors
   description: Extract the specified colors from the image

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid through a specific rule.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Key Colors:** Focus only on the blue (1), white (0) and green (3) pixels in the input grid, ignoring all other colors (like yellow).
2. **Locate Top-Left:** Find the top-left most instance of those colors.
3. **Construct Output Grid:** Using that origin, select a 3 x 3 grid that has blue(1) at top-left corner, green(3) at top-right corner, and the rest all white(0).

In essence, the transformation extracts a very specific 3x3 sub-region based on specific color values from the original image.
