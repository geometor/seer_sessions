    *   Input Pattern: The expected output's colors appear in 3x3 blocks within a larger, repeating structure. The '1' (blue) pixels are in the 6th, 9th, 12th, etc. rows, and the 6th, 9th, etc. columns. The '3' (green) pixels are at row 6, column 12 and row 6, column 18. The '0's surround them. The selected area is in the lower-left of each repeated pattern.

*   **Example 2:**
