The primary colors involved appear to be blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4). The input grid seems to contain rectangular shapes of red, with single yellow pixels within them, and a small green/yellow cross-like shape. The blue acts like the background. The transformation appears to involve creating stripes through the red objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
