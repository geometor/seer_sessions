Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a flawed understanding of the transformation rule, likely overemphasized from the first example. It focused on expanding azure (8) pixels, and had an incorrect condition about adjacency to red (2) pixels, causing an unnecessary second expansion step. The results on the subsequent examples clearly show this: many pixels are incorrectly transformed. The code is replacing all colors with azure adjacent to red. The main issue is an incorrect assumption on the initial expansion.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Carefully look at all input/output pairs again, paying close attention to *all* color changes, not just azure.
2.  **Identify the True Rule:** Determine the *actual* relationship between red, azure and the other colors.
3.  **Revise the Natural Language Program:**  Clearly state the corrected rule, focusing on the conditions that trigger the color change.
4.  **Update observations:** Ensure all properties and objects are correct.
5.  **Plan for Code Modification:** With a solid natural language program, it will be easier to update the Python code in the next phase.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a more detailed analysis of each example, noting the important metrics:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Initial assumption: Azure expands, and expands further adjacent to red.
    *   Problem: The assumption does not include a color change of other pixels to azure, when not adjacent to red.
    *   Major differences: The assumption on red adjacency expansion is incorrect, there are areas that did not turn azure.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Initial assumption: Azure expands, and expands further adjacent to red.
    *   Problem: The assumption does not cover the case of expansion of other colors.
    *   Major differences: The assumption on red adjacency is incorrect, there should be more azure expansion.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Initial assumption: Azure expands, and expands further adjacent to red.
    *   Problem: The assumption does not cover the case of expansion of other colors.
    *   Major differences: The assumption on red adjacency expansion is incorrect, there should be a lot more azure color, but this example has no red.

**YAML Block (Observations):**

```yaml
observations:
  - example: 1
    objects:
      - color: 8  # Azure
        initial_positions: "Scattered throughout the grid"
        behavior: "Expands one layer around itself, changes color of adjacent pixels"
      - color: 2  # Red
        initial_positions: "Present in the grid"
        behavior: "Adjacent to azure, causes *all* adjacent pixels to become azure."
      - color: 0
        initial_positions: "background"
        behavior: "changes to azure when next to azure"

  - example: 2
    objects:
      - color: 2  # Red
        initial_positions: "Forms a continuous border and some isolated lines"
        behavior: "Adjacent to azure, causes *all* adjacent pixels to become azure."
      - color: 8
        initial_position: "does not exist"
        behavior: "appears, one layer surrounding red"
      - color: 1
        initial_position: "in grid"
        behavior: "changed to azure when adjacent to red"
      - color: 0
        initial_position: "background"
        behavior: "changes to azure when next to azure"
  - example: 3
      - color: 1  # Blue
        initial_positions: "Forms a continuous border and some isolated lines"
        behavior: "Adjacent to azure, causes *all* adjacent pixels to become azure."
      - color: 8
        initial_position: "does not exist"
        behavior: "appears, one layer surrounding blue"
      - color: 3
        initial_position: "in grid"
        behavior: "changed to azure when adjacent to blue"
      - color: 0
        initial_position: "background"
        behavior: "changes to azure when next to blue"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Target Pixels:** Find all pixels of a "target" color. The target color appears to be colors other than 0 in the input, and the target color changes in each example.
2.  **Expansion:** All pixels adjacent to a target colored pixel are changed to azure (8), including diagonally.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
