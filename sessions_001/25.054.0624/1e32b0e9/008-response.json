Consider these lines as \"barriers\" or \"fixed\" components.\n\n2. **Blue Pixel Influence:**  Focus on the blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n\n3. **Red Pixel Modification, but not with Knight's Move Adjacency:**\n   -  Examine red (2) pixels directly *above, below, or the to sides* (NOT diagonally or by Knight's move) of each blue pixel.\n   -  If the \"influence\" (adjacency) extends past a barrier row, those influenced red (2) pixels will not be changed. For example:\n        - Consider the isolated '1' pixel in the input grid, third to last row, column 9:\n            - The red pixels *above, below, left, and right* are changed\n        - Consider the isolated '1' pixel in the input grid, row 2, column 15:\n           - The red pixels *above, below, and left* are changed, but NOT to the right\n        - Consider the 3x1 block of '1' pixels in the input grid, rows 2-4, column 2:\n            - The red pixels *below, left, and right* are changed.\n\n4. **No Other Changes:** All other pixels, including white (0) pixels and red (2) pixels not adjacent to blue (1) pixels and not influenced past a red (2) barrier, remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_adjacent_pixels(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Gets directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    adjacent = []\n    if row > 0:\n        adjacent.append((row - 1, col))  # Up\n    if row < rows - 1:\n        adjacent.append((row + 1, col))  # Down\n    if col > 0:\n        adjacent.append((row, col - 1))  # Left\n    if col < cols - 1:\n        adjacent.append((row, col + 1))  # Right\n    return adjacent\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Identify barrier rows (rows 6 and 12, but 0-indexed as 5 and 11)\n    barrier_rows = [5, 11]\n\n    # Find blue pixels\n    blue_pixels = [(r, c) for r in range(rows) for c in range(cols) if input_grid[r, c] == 1]\n\n    # Modify red pixels based on blue pixel adjacency and barriers\n    for r, c in blue_pixels:\n        adjacent_reds = []\n        for ar, ac in get_adjacent_pixels(input_grid, r, c):\n            if input_grid[ar, ac] == 2:\n                # Check for barrier crossing\n                crosses_barrier = False\n                if r < ar: # adjacent is below\n                    for barrier_row in barrier_rows:\n                        if r < barrier_row < ar:\n                            crosses_barrier = True\n                            break\n                elif r > ar: # adjacent is above\n                     for barrier_row in barrier_rows:\n                        if ar < barrier_row < r:\n                            crosses_barrier = True\n                            break               \n                if not crosses_barrier:\n                    adjacent_reds.append((ar, ac))\n\n\n        for ar, ac in adjacent_reds:\n            output_grid[ar, ac] = 2 # Keep the value as 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
