The core transformation seems to involve the azure (8) pixels. Specifically, it appears that azure (8) regions are either expanding, or new azure pixels are being added, based on the positions of the other colors. There's a clear geometrical, grid-based aspect to the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
