2. **Locate Influencing Pixels:** Identify all pixels that *are not* part of the barrier rows.

4. **Barrier Rows Unchanged:** The pixels in the barrier rows do not change.

Okay, let's analyze the results of the first iteration and strategize for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified rule.  The code correctly identifies two "barrier" rows and attempts to propagate the color of non-barrier pixels to their neighbors. However, it fails dramatically on examples 2 and 3. The fundamental flaw is that the barrier rows are *not* fixed at rows 5 and 11.  The examples show that these barrier rows are different and consistent within each input/output pair, but are different between the examples. The propagation rule is almost correct, but the implementation misinterprets which pixels act as the "source" of the propagation. It looks as if we should use the barrier row color and propagate that to adjacent non-barrier rows.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Dynamic Barrier Detection:** Instead of hardcoding rows 5 and 11, we need to *detect* the barrier rows dynamically in each input grid.  The barrier rows appear to be the only rows that have a uniform color across the entire row, and that color is the same in both the input and output.
2.  **Corrected Propagation Rule:**  The current propagation logic is backwards.  The existing code changes neighboring cells to the color of a "source cell". Instead, the correct logic should be: if a cell is adjacent to a barrier row, change it to the color of the barrier row, unless the cell is already part of a different barrier row.
3. **YAML and NL Program Refinement:** Update the observations and natural language program to reflect these crucial changes.

**Metrics Gathering (Illustrative - Requires Code Execution for Full Accuracy)**

I will describe the metrics gathering process. I will provide illustrative data.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Barrier Row Colors: 8 (azure)
    *   Barrier Row Indices: 5, 11
    *   Pixels Changed (Expected): A significant number around the barriers
    *   Pixels Changed (Actual): Different from Expected, as seen in visual comparison.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Barrier Row Colors: 2 (red)
    *   Barrier Row Indices: 5, 11
    *   Pixels Changed (Expected, illustrative): Many 1s and some 0s near the barriers should change to 2.
    *   Pixels Changed (Actual): Very few pixels changed, incorrect colors.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Barrier Row Colors: 1 (blue)
    *   Barrier Row Indices: 5, 11
    *    Pixels Changed: many
    *   Pixels Changed (Actual): very few changed to the correct color

**YAML Block (Updated Observations)**

```yaml
observations:
  - task_id: "010"
    example_id: 1
    objects:
      - type: barrier_row
        properties:

          description: "Horizontal lines spanning entire width, color unchanged."
      - type: other_pixels
        properties:

      - type: other_pixels
        properties:

          final_color: "Matches adjacent barrier row if adjacent, otherwise unchanged."
    actions:
      - description: "Propagate barrier row color to directly adjacent (non-diagonal) non-barrier pixels."

```

**Natural Language Program (Revised)**

1.  **Identify Barrier Rows:** Examine each row in the input grid. A barrier row is a row where *all* pixels have the *same* color. There should be two barrier rows, and the color of these rows should be present in the example's color palette.
2. **Barrier Color:** Note the color of the barrier row - this color does not change between input and output.
3.  **Propagate Color:** For each pixel *not* in a barrier row, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right - not diagonally).
4. If a pixel is adjacent to *any* pixel that is part of a barrier row, set its
   color to the color of that barrier row.
5.  **Barrier Rows Unchanged:** The pixels in the barrier rows do not change their color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
