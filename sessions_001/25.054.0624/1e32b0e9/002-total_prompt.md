Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid with three distinct colors: white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The core transformation seems to involve the azure (8) pixels. Specifically, it appears that azure (8) regions are either expanding, or new azure pixels are being added, based on the positions of the other colors. There's a clear geometrical, grid-based aspect to the transformation.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_pixel
    color: red
    value: 2
    properties:
      - static: true  # Red pixels don't seem to move or change

  - name: azure_pixel
    color: azure
    value: 8
    properties:
      - dynamic: true # Azure pixels appear to change, possibly growing or with new ones added.

  - name: white_pixel
    color: white
    value: 0
    properties:
      - static: true   # acts as a background.

actions:
  - name: azure_expansion
    description: Azure pixels expand or appear around existing azure and potentially based on red locations.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The relationship between azure and red, and azure and other azure, seems important. Proximity/adjacency guides the expansion.
  - type: containment
    description:  Azure pixels tend to form connected regions or lines.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all existing azure (8) and red(2) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Iterate** through each *existing* azure (8) pixel.

3. **Propagate** For each adjacent position (up, down, left, right) to existing azure pixel:
     - **If** an adjacent position is empty (white, 0):
        - Change it to azure (8)

4. **Iterate** thought each *red* (2) pixel
   
    5. **Propagate** - For each adjacent postion (up, down, left, right) to red pixel:
     -  **If** an adjacent position is empty (white/0):
          - Do nothing
     - **Elif** an adjacent position containts an azure pixel:
          -  Expand azure, by adding azure pixels to all adjacents of the azure
             pixel.

Essentially, azure pixels form lines. And those lines become 2 pixel thickness if adjacent to red pixel

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
