Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and generated code were clearly off-base. The code attempts a complex logic involving alternating blue insertions based on the presence of green pixels in columns, preserving existing blue lines. However, the results across all three examples show a significant mismatch, indicating fundamental flaws in understanding the transformation rule. The strategy needs to shift from trying to refine this existing logic to completely re-interpreting the core pattern. From looking at expected output, the main issue is blue insertion is not correct. Looking at the errors, the size is always correct, but the colors and pixel counts are way off - this will help us quickly evaluate ideas in the future.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Discard the previous interpretation entirely. Focus on identifying simple, consistent relationships between input and output grids.
2.  **Focus on Invariants:** Identify elements that remain unchanged between input and output (e.g., the two solid horizontal lines are always preserved).
3.  **Simplify:** Look for the most basic transformations (copying, replacing, inserting) before considering complex conditional logic.
4. **Prioritize Blue Insertion:** The color blue appears more in the outputs that inputs, suggesting insertion.
5. **Green as Placeholder:** In each example, green has an important role
6.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a very basic program and add complexity only as needed to match the examples.

**Metrics and Observations (from code execution and visual inspection):**

I will manually create reports here, focusing on the relationship between input and output.

**Example 1 Report:**

*   **Input:** Two horizontal azure (8) lines. Red (2) and Azure (8) scattered.
*   **Output:** Two horizontal azure (8) lines are preserved. The red pixels are kept, and the adjacent azure pixels to them change color.
*   **Differences:**
    *   Many azure (8) pixels, specifically those adjacent to reds, are added.

**Example 2 Report:**

*   **Input:** Two horizontal red (2) lines. Blue (1) and Red (2) scattered.
*   **Output:** Two horizontal red (2) lines are preserved. Where there was scattered blue and reds, red pixels seem to fill in the empty areas with a preference for areas where there was blue.
*   **Differences:**
    *   The output has many reds added where adjacent to blue.

**Example 3 Report:**

*   **Input:** Two horizontal blue (1) lines. Green (3) scattered.
*   **Output:** Two horizontal blue (1) lines are preserved. The green pixels are also kept in the same places.
*   **Differences:**
    *   Blue fills where there are adjacent greens

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  invariant_objects:
    - type: horizontal_lines
      color: azure
      rows: [5, 11]
  transformation: fill
  fill_details:
    - object:
        color: azure
        condition: next to red

example_2:
  invariant_objects:
    - type: horizontal_lines
      color: red
      rows: [5, 11]
  transformation: fill
  fill_details:
     - object:
        color: red
        condition: next to blues

example_3:
  invariant_objects:
    - type: horizontal_lines
      color: blue
      rows: [5, 11]
  transformation:
    - action: preserve green pixels
    - action: fill
      fill_details:
        - object:
           color: blue
           condition: next to greens
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Horizontal Lines:** Copy any two complete horizontal lines of a single color from the input to the output, maintaining their original row positions and colors.
2.  **Preserve Unique Color:** Copy any unique colors pixels to their original location
3. **Fill Rule:** Except for preserved lines, fill adjacent areas of unique color pixels of the same color.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
