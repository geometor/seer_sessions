            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code is based on preserving two horizontal lines of the same color and filling areas adjacent to unique colored pixels. This approach clearly fails in all three examples, as evidenced by the high number of `pixels_off`. The filling logic also appears to be too aggressive and uncontrolled, leading to large areas of incorrect colors. The strategy needs to shift from simply preserving lines and filling, to a more sophisticated understanding of the relationships between objects and their positions. The core issue seems to be an incorrect interpretation of the filling rule: it's not just about filling adjacent to any unique color, but filling based on a combination of a 'line' concept, unique color, and proximity. In example two, diagonal neighbors are treated differently.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Filling Rule:** The current fill logic is too broad. We need to consider:\n    *   **Connectivity:** Filling should likely be restricted to 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) and not 8.\n    *   **Context:** Filling seems to be related to extending the colors from the single-pixel-wide, colored lines.\n    *   **Boundaries:** What stops the fill? It seems the fill is bounded by different colors and the edges of the grid.\n\n2.  **Consider Line Properties:** It does not seem to matter that the lines are\n    solid colors. It is more important that there are two lines.\n    The color and location may matter.\n\n3.  **Unique Colors are Important:** The code correctly determined which\n    colors should be preserved and the ones that do not appear on the output\n    (black in these examples.)\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example-Specific):**\nI will describe what I observe, then provide yaml.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   There are two azure (8) lines.\n    *   Unique colors are red (2) and azure (8).\n    *   The red (2) pixels form horizontal lines.\n    *   The filling of color 8 happens around each 8, except on rows with the\n        full line.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   There are two red (2) lines.\n    *   Unique colors are red (2) and blue (1).\n    *   The blue pixels are where the fill boundaries will be.\n    *   The red pixels in the line become the fill color.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   There are two blue (1) lines.\n    *   Unique colors are blue(1) and green (3).\n    *   The green pixels are where the fill boundaries will be.\n    *   The filling only extends from single pixel wide lines, of any length 1\n        or greater, to boundary.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    - type: horizontal_line\n      color: 8\n      rows: [5, 11]\n    - type: unique_pixels\n      color: 2\n      locations: [[1,2], [2,1], [2,2], [2,3], [3,2], [7,8], [8,7], [8,8], [8,9], [9,8], [13, 2], [14, 1], [14, 2], [14, 3], [15, 2]]\n    - type: unique_pixels\n      color: 8\n      locations: [[0,5],[0,10], [1,5],[1,10], [2,5],[2,10], [3,5],[3,10],[4,5],[4,10],[6,5],[6,10],[7,5],[7,10],[8,5],[8,10],[9,5],[9,10],[10,5],[10,10],[12,5],[12,10],[13,5],[13,10],[14,5],[14,10],[15,5],[15,10],[16,5],[16,10]]\n  transformation:\n    - preserve_lines: 8\n    - extend_unique_colors: [2, 8]\n    - fill_rule: 4-connectivity\nexample_2:\n  objects:\n    - type: horizontal_line\n      color: 2\n      rows: [5, 11]\n    - type: unique_pixels\n      color: 1\n      locations:  [[1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [2,1], [2,2], [2,3], [2,7], [2,8], [3,1], [3,2], [3,3],[8,14], [13,8], [14,7], [14,8], [14,9], [15,7], [15,8], [15,9]]\n    - type: unique_pixels\n      color: 2\n      locations: [[0,5],[0,10], [1,5],[1,10], [2,5],[2,10], [3,5],[3,10],[4,5],[4,10],[6,5],[6,10],[7,5],[7,10],[8,5],[8,10],[9,5],[9,10],[10,5],[10,10],[12,5],[12,10],[13,5],[13,10],[14,5],[14,10],[15,5],[15,10],[16,5],[16,10]]\n\n  transformation:\n    - preserve_lines: 2\n    - extend_unique_colors: [1, 2]\n    - fill_rule: 4-connectivity\nexample_3:\n  objects:\n    - type: horizontal_line\n      color: 1\n      rows: [5, 11]\n    - type: unique_pixels\n      color: 1\n      locations: [[0,5],[0,10], [1,5],[1,10], [2,5],[2,10], [3,5],[3,10],[4,5],[4,10],[6,5],[6,10],[7,5],[7,10],[8,5],[8,10],[9,5],[9,10],[10,5],[10,10],[12,5],[12,10],[13,5],[13,10],[14,5],[14,10],[15,5],[15,10],[16,5],[16,10]]\n    - type: unique_pixels\n      color: 3\n      locations:  [[1,2], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2], [7,2], [8,1], [14,15], [15,14]]\n\n  transformation:\n    - preserve_lines: 1\n    - extend_unique_colors: [1, 3]\n    - fill_rule: 4-connectivity\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Find two complete horizontal lines of the *same* color within the input grid.

The fill should not extend through diagonal connections. Do not extend colors across the complete preserved lines.\n"
