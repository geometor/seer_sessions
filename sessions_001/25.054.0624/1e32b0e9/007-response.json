The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the red (2) pixels, specifically those that are adjacent to blue (1) pixels, but the nature of \"adjacency\" needs further analysis. There's a large horizontal line of red (2) pixels that remains unchanged, suggesting that overall structure or specific configurations might influence the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider these lines as \"barriers\" or \"fixed\" components.\n\n2. **Blue Pixel Influence:**  Focus on the blue (1) pixels in the input grid.\n\n3. **Red Pixel Modification, but not with Knight's Move Adjacency:**\n   -  Examine red (2) pixels directly *above, below, or the to sides* (NOT diagonally or by Knight's move) of each blue pixel.\n   -  If the \"influence\" (adjacency) extends past a barrier row, those influenced red (2) pixels will not be changed. For example:\n        - Consider the isolated '1' pixel in the input grid, third to last row, column 9:\n            - The red pixels *above, below, left, and right* are changed\n        - Consider the isolated '1' pixel in the input grid, row 2, column 15:\n           - The red pixels *above, below, and left* are changed, but NOT to the right\n        - Consider the 3x1 block of '1' pixels in the input grid, rows 2-4, column 2:\n            - The red pixels *below, left, and right* are changed.\n\n4. **No Other Changes:** All other pixels, including white (0) pixels and red (2) pixels not adjacent to blue (1) pixels and not influenced past a red (2) barrier, remain unchanged.\n"
