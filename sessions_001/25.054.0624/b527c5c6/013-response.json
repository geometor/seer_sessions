The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve some kind of selective modification of existing objects and potentially the creation of new ones based on certain criteria. The input grid contains two distinct green (3) objects, each containing a single red (2) pixel. The output seems to modify the top-left green object and creates a new red object to the left of the lower-right green object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Within this object, locate the single red (2) pixel. For the top three rows of this green object, if the x index is less than 9, change all green (3) pixels to white (0).\n\n2.  **Bottom-Right Object Extension:** Identify the green (3) rectangular object at the lower part of the input grid. Add a column of red (2) pixels adjacent to the left edge of this bottom-right object, aligning it with the top row of the original bottom-right object. The red pixels mirror the shape of the adjacent border of the green object.\n\nEssentially, the top-left green object is partially \"erased\" or trimmed, while the lower object gains an adjacent red region.\n"
