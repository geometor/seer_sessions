Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), red (2), and white (0). The transformation appears to involve some kind of interaction between the green and red pixels, potentially related to their position and adjacency. The white pixels seem to act as a background and are possibly unchanged. The overall shape of the connected green component is altered, with some parts expanding vertically. Some red pixels are also introduced on the right side.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - green (3)
        - red (2)
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [height, width]
      cells: list of pixels

actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: Green pixels expand vertically downwards.
  - type: addition
    description: red pixels are added in specific locations on the right boundary of a green shape.
  - type: replacement
    description: red pixels replace green pixel

relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels of the same or different colors can be adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
  - containment: The grid contains all pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels. These form the primary objects.

2.  **Vertical Expansion (Green):**  For the leftmost green object, expand the green region downwards. The expansion extends to the bottom of the grid. The width of this object matches the original width, and the y coordinates are maintained.

3.  **Red Replacement:** All red pixels on the left become part of the expanding left green block.

4.  **Red Addition (Right Side):** For the right green object. Add red pixels at the right edge of the expanded shape. It appears this starts at the original red square on the right of the initial shape and continues downwards.

5. **Vertical Expansion (Red):** Expand any new red regions vertically downwards until the bottom of the board.

In summary, the leftmost green object expands down, replacing any reds on the left and encompassing them. Red pixels are generated on the right boundary of the rightmost green object and expand down.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
