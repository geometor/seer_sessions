Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are green (3), red (2), and white (0). The input grid appears to have two distinct regions: a green region at the top-left and a white region at the bottom-right, separated by an inverse-L green region. There's a single red pixel within the green region. The output grid maintains the same overall shape, but with changes within the white region, introducing parts of inverse L.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
