The output is a much smaller, simpler grid, primarily composed of the color magenta (6), with a few white (0) pixels. The input grid has distinct regions of color, including green (3), azure (8), magenta (6), and blue (1). The output grid seems to focus on a specific area within the larger input grid and simplifies the color palette.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
