            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of extracting a 5x5 subgrid from the top-right corner is correct in terms of location, but the color remapping logic is flawed and inconsistent across the examples. The code attempts to handle different color combinations with `if/elif` conditions, but this approach is not generalizable and fails to capture the underlying rule. The results show significant discrepancies between the expected and transformed outputs, especially in terms of color assignments. We need a more systematic approach to color mapping.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Identify the correct 5x5 region:** This part seems to be working fine, so we'll keep the `find_target_region` function.\n2.  **Analyze Color Relationships:** Instead of hardcoding color mappings, we need to determine the relationship between input and output colors *within* the 5x5 region *for each example*.\n3.  **Develop a Consistent Rule:** Based on the analysis, we'll formulate a rule that consistently transforms input colors to output colors across all examples.\n4. **Prioritize observations** - rank the facts in terms of how central they are to the solution.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\nI will create reports about each of the execution results.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Colors (5x5 region):** 0, 1, 3\n*   **Output Colors (5x5 region):** 0, 3\n*   **Expected Transformation:**\n    *   1 -> 0\n    *   3 -> 3\n    *   0 -> 0\n*  **Observed Transformation:**\n    * all values set to 0, except the last two columns set to 3\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Colors (5x5 region):** 0, 3, 8\n*   **Output Colors (5x5 region):** 0, 6\n*    **Expected Transformation:**\n    * 3 -> 6\n    * 8 -> 0\n    * 0 -> 0\n* **Observed Transformation:**\n    * mix of 0s and 6s\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input Colors (5x5 region):** 0, 1, 3, 5\n*   **Output Colors (5x5 region):** 0, 5\n*   **Expected Transformation:**\n    *   0 -> 0\n    *   1 -> 0\n    *   3 -> 5\n    *    5 -> 5\n* **Observed Transformation**\n    * mix of 0s and 6s\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      priority: 1\n      input_region: top_right_5x5\n      input_colors: [0, 1, 3]\n      output_colors: [0, 3]\n      color_mapping:\n        0: 0\n        1: 0\n        3: 3\n      grid_size: 5x5\n      object_description: \"The output is a copy of the 5x5 subgrid in the top right of the input, with some color changes\"\n\n  - example_2:\n      priority: 1\n      input_region: top_right_5x5\n      input_colors: [0, 3, 8]\n      output_colors: [0, 6]\n      color_mapping:\n        0: 0\n        3: 6\n        8: 0\n      grid_size: 5x5\n        object_description: \"The output is a copy of the 5x5 subgrid in the top right of the input, with some color changes\"\n\n  - example_3:\n      priority: 1\n      input_region: top_right_5x5\n      input_colors: [0, 1, 3, 5]\n      output_colors: [0, 5]\n      color_mapping:\n        0: 0\n        1: 0\n        3: 5\n        5: 5\n      grid_size: 5x5\n        object_description: \"The output is a copy of the 5x5 subgrid in the top right of the input, with some color changes\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Locate Subgrid:** Extract the 5x5 subgrid from the upper-right corner of the input grid.\n2.  **Map Colors:** Apply the following color transformation *within the extracted subgrid*:\n    *   If the input color is 0, keep it as 0.\n    *   If the input color is 1, change it to 0.\n    *   If the input color is 3, and 8 is NOT present in the subgrid, change it to either 6 or 5 depending on other colors in the area.\n        If 5 is NOT present, change 3 to 5.\n        If 8 is present, change 3 to 6.\n    *    If the input color is 8, change to 0.\n    *   If input color is 5, keep it as 5.\n\n3.  **Output:** The output grid is the transformed 5x5 subgrid.\n"
