"""
The transformation rule appears to involve duplicating the columns of the input grid. The number of times the columns are duplicated seems to correspond with the value of the input grid. Specifically, columns in the input grid with color '1' results in output where columns are not duplicated, color value '2' is duplicated once resulting in an additional column, and color value '3' results in columns being duplicated twice.

1.  **Observe Input:** Examine the input grid.
2.  **Determine Duplication Factor:** For each column determine the color value *n*.
3.  **Duplicate Columns:** The number of times to duplicate is *n*-1. Create a new output grid.  For each column in the input, copy that column to the output, then copy it again *n*-1 times.
4.  **Return Output:** The resulting grid is the output.
