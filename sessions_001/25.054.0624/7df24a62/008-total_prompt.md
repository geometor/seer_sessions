Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are colored pixels arranged in a grid. The colors present are yellow (4), blue (1), and white (0).  There are distinct yellow objects scattered across the grid. A blue square appears in the input and a mirrored version appears at the bottom. It appears the output maintains the yellow objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - yellow (4)
        - blue (1)
        - white (0)
      position: (row, column)
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: blue
      shape: square
      position: (row, column)
      size: 4x4

actions:
  - name: reflect
    object: blue square
    axis: horizontal

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Yellow pixels are scattered.
  - type: spatial
    description: Blue square is near the center, reflected image is on the opposite vertical side.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all yellow (4) pixels and a 4x4 blue (1) square within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Yellow:** Copy all yellow pixels from the input grid to the output grid at their original positions.
3. **Reflect Blue:**
    *   Find the horizontal center axis of a new empty grid.
    *   For each row of pixels starting below the blue square to the end of the blue square, add rows of blank pixels above the horizontal center of the new output grid.
    *   Mirror the original blue square on the opposite side of the input grid relative to the vertical placement. Place the mirrored 4x4 blue square in the bottom-center region.

In summary, the transformation preserves the yellow pixels and adds a mirrored blue square on the opposite vertical side of the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
