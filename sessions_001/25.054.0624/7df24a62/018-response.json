Yellow pixels can exist as single, isolated units or as connected components forming larger shapes.\n2.  **Determine Isolation:** A yellow pixel is considered \"isolated\" if it has no orthogonally adjacent (up, down, left, or right) neighboring pixels of the same color (yellow). Diagonally adjacent yellow pixels do not negate isolation.\n3.  **Apply Halo:** For each isolated yellow pixel, change the color of all adjacent pixels (including diagonally adjacent ones) from white (0) to blue (1), creating a \"halo\" effect, except when it's not 0.\n4. **Preserve:** Pixels that are not adjacent to single isolated yellow are not modified.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_adjacent_positions(grid, row, col, include_diagonal=True):\n    \"\"\"Gets the adjacent positions for a given cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    adjacent_positions = []\n    for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(rows, row + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(cols, col + 2)):\n            if (i, j) != (row, col):  # Exclude the cell itself\n                if not include_diagonal and (abs(i - row) + abs(j-col) > 1):\n                    continue\n                adjacent_positions.append((i, j))\n    return adjacent_positions\n\ndef is_isolated(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a yellow pixel is isolated (not orthogonally adjacent to other yellow pixels).\"\"\"\n    if grid[row, col] != 4:\n        return False\n\n    adjacent_coords = get_adjacent_positions(grid, row, col, include_diagonal=False)\n    for r, c in adjacent_coords:\n        if grid[r, c] == 4:\n            return False  # Not isolated if orthogonally adjacent to another yellow pixel\n    return True\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the halo rule.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through each cell to find isolated yellow pixels\n    for row in range(rows):\n        for col in range(cols):\n            if is_isolated(input_grid, row, col):\n                # Apply blue halo to all adjacent positions, including diagonals\n                adjacent_coords = get_adjacent_positions(input_grid, row, col, include_diagonal=True)\n                for r, c in adjacent_coords:\n                    if output_grid[r, c] == 0:  # Only change background (0) pixels\n                        output_grid[r, c] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
