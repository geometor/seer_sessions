"""
1.  **Identify Existing Objects:** Locate the existing 3x3 blue square and all yellow pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Yellow Pixel Interaction:**
    *   If a yellow pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but not diagonally) to any pixel of the existing 3x3 blue square, change that yellow pixel to blue in the output.
    *   If a yellow pixel is not adjacent to the existing blue square, there are two cases. First, consider expansion of yellow to blue in proximity of existing blue:
        * if yellow is immediately to the left of existing blue, new blue is generated to the immediate left of existing yellow.
        * if yellow is immediately above existing blue, new blue is generated one position above existing yellow
    * else, if yellow is not one of the above cases, keep it as black/background (0) in the output.

3. **Preserve Existing Blue:** Maintain the original 3x3 blue square in its original position in the output.

4.  **Background:** All other pixels that are not part of the identified objects or changed by the interaction rules remain black/background (0).

Okay, let's analyze the results of the tests and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program and code were based on observations from the first training example, which involved a 3x3 blue square and its interaction with yellow pixels. The code attempts to capture the rule of yellow pixels turning blue if adjacent to the blue square, and a specific "expansion" rule where blue extends one unit if yellow appears to left or above. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this initial rule is insufficient and misses key aspects of the transformation. The matches are all `False`, and many pixels are incorrect.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine all Examples:** Carefully look at all input-output pairs again, paying close attention to *all* color changes, not just blue and yellow. The initial focus was too narrow.
2.  **Identify All Object Types:** The description was fixated on a "3x3 blue square". Determine if this is truly a consistent object or if a more general description of object interactions should be used.
3.  **Generalized Interaction Rules:** Instead of specific rules ("left of blue", "above blue"), formulate more general rules about how *any* objects of different colors interact, based on adjacency or relative position. Consider cases where the 3x3 blue square is not present.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with a simple, high-level description of the transformation, and then iteratively refine it based on where it fails in the examples.

**Metrics and Reports (using print statements in a conceptual way - not a formal jupyter notebook):**

```python
# Conceptual - imagine this being executed, and providing output to include below
# Focusing on getting the core information

def analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """
    Analyzes an individual example. Reports differences.
    """
    
    print("Input Grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Expected Output:")
    print(expected_output)
    print("Transformed Output:")
    print(transformed_output)

    match = np.array_equal(expected_output, transformed_output)
    print(f"Match: {match}")

    if not match:
        diff = expected_output != transformed_output
        pixels_off = np.sum(diff)
        print(f"Pixels Off: {pixels_off}")
        
        # Count occurences of each color in expected output
        expected_color_counts = {}
        for color in range(10):
          expected_color_counts[color] = np.sum(expected_output == color)
        print(f"Expected Color Counts: {expected_color_counts}")
        
        # Count occurences of each color in transformed output
        transformed_color_counts = {}
        for color in range(10):
          transformed_color_counts[color] = np.sum(transformed_output == color)
        print(f"Transformed Color Counts: {transformed_color_counts}")
        
        print("Pixel differences (expected -> transformed):")
        for r in range(expected_output.shape[0]):
          for c in range(expected_output.shape[1]):
            if expected_output[r,c] != transformed_output[r,c]:
              print(f"  ({r},{c}): {expected_output[r,c]} -> {transformed_output[r,c]}")

# Example usage for each of the provided training examples (1 to 4)
#  ... call analyze_results for each example ...
```

The `analyze_results` calls (which I can't execute directly here) would provide specific output like pixel counts, color discrepancies, and coordinate-by-coordinate differences, as shown in the provided test results. I will summarize these below.

**Summary of Metrics (from the provided test results):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Match: False, Pixels Off: 22
    *   Key Errors:  Blue pixels were not generated correctly around the yellow in the lower part of the grids. Yellow pixels were incorrectly removed.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Match: False, Pixels Off: 14
    *   Key Errors: Blue was not generated. Yellow was incorrectly removed.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Match: False, Pixels Off: 50
    *   Key Errors: Blue pixels were missing. Yellow pixels were not altered to blue.
*   **Example 4:**
    *    Match: False. Pixels Off: 29
    *    Key Error: Many incorrect transformations of 4 to 0. No 0 to 1 transitions in the top left.

**Updated Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of the same color in the input grid.

2.  **Object Interaction - Yellow and Blue:**
    * If a yellow object is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, but *not* diagonally) to any pixel of a blue object, change all pixels in the *entire* yellow object to blue in the output grid.
    * If there is a blue region and a yellow region is directly to the left of the blue region, generate new blue pixels that extend to the left of the blue, and aligned with the rows of the yellow object. The existing yellow pixels are removed.
    * If there is a blue region and a yellow region is directly above the blue region, generate new blue pixels that extend above of the blue, aligned with the columns of the yellow object. The existing yellow pixels are removed.

3.  **Preserve Existing Blue:** Existing blue objects remain blue, and the new adjacent regions.

4. **Other Colors:** If a pixel is not adjacent to a blue object, then it stays as its original color.

5.  **Background:** All pixels that are not affected by an interaction rule will become or remain background/black (0).

Key Changes and Reasoning:

*   **Generalized Adjacency:** The rule now applies to *any* blue object, not just a 3x3 square.  This addresses errors in examples where the blue region wasn't a perfect square.
*   **Whole Object Transformation:** When yellow turns blue due to adjacency, *all* connected yellow pixels change, not just the directly adjacent ones. This is crucial for correctness.
*  **Specific cases for blue expansion:** The "expansion" rule seems consistent.

The updated program attempts to account for the observed behavior across all examples. It still needs to be implemented in code and rigorously tested.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
