The primary colors observed are yellow (4), blue (1), and black/background (0). There are distinct regions or \"objects\" of yellow and blue. The transformation seems to involve some interaction between the blue and yellow regions, with the blue potentially influencing the yellow, or a combination of blue and yellow creating another blue object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

First, consider expansion of yellow to blue in proximity of existing blue:\n        * if yellow is immediately to the left of existing blue, new blue is generated to the immediate left of existing yellow.\n        * if yellow is immediately above existing blue, new blue is generated one position above existing yellow\n    * else, if yellow is not one of the above cases, keep it as black/background (0) in the output.\n\n3. **Preserve Existing Blue:** Maintain the original 3x3 blue square in its original position in the output.\n\n4.  **Background:** All other pixels that are not part of the identified objects or changed by the interaction rules remain black/background (0).\n"
