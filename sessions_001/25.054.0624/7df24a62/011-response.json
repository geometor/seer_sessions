The code attempts to find blue shapes and move them to the top, but it doesn't handle overlaps correctly, nor does it accurately \"mirror\" the shapes. The \"mirroring\" concept is also not consistent with the observed output transformations in several examples.\n\nThe key issues are:\n\n1.  **Incorrect \"Mirroring\"**: The code simply copies the blue shapes to the top, starting from the leftmost column of their bounding box. It doesn't perform a horizontal flip, which might be a better interpretation.\n2.  **Overlap Handling**: The code attempts to avoid overlaps by checking and moving down, however its approach to collision detection is flawed.\n3. **Example 1**: the code has not correctly moved all the blue shapes to the top - additional copies of the shape remain at the bottom\n4. **Example 2**: the code has not correctly moved all the blue shapes to the top - additional copies of the shape remain at the bottom.\n5. **Example 3**: The code has not detected the blue shapes. Additional blue and yellow copies of the shape remain at the bottom.\n6.  **Example 4**: The code has not detected blue shape correctly and some of the blue shape is placed at the top. Additional blue and yellow shapes remain at the bottom.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate the Core Transformation**: Instead of \"mirroring,\" the transformation seems to be more about *relocating* blue shapes to the top of the grid, while preserving yellow pixels. The shapes appear to be copied or placed at the highest possible position in the output grid. Overlap avoidance logic needs refining, checking for *any* non-black pixel, not just yellow ones.\n2.  **Refine Shape Handling**: Ensure the code correctly identifies all contiguous blue shapes, even those adjacent to other colors.\n3. **Correct placement logic:** improve placement logic to select highest possible location.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using imagined code execution)**\n\nLet's use a more descriptive analysis, as if we had an extended code execution environment (which we'll simulate here).\n\n```python\n# --- Simulated Extended Code Execution Results ---\n\ndef
