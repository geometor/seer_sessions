Okay, let's analyze the results of the executed code on the training examples and devise a strategy for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code implements a size-based filtering approach, removing "noisy" small objects and retaining larger, more structured ones. While the core idea has merit, the results indicate several shortcomings:

1.  **Inaccurate Object Removal:** The code removes some objects that *should* be retained (e.g., parts of the large maroon '9' shapes in Example 1, parts of connected structures in all examples), and incorrectly preserves parts of others.
2.  **Incorrect Reconstruction:** It isn't filling missing areas or making any special actions with single pixel objects.
3.  **Color Palette Issues:**  The code, as it is removes many instances of colors that should be in the output, and is changing/removing some colors.
4. **Background color selection:** The assumption about background is incorrect.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Instead of relying solely on Depth First Search (DFS) and a size threshold, we should use additional criteria like, bounding boxes, object properties and consider adjacency.
2.  **Improve Reconstruction Logic:** After removing small noisy objects, compare the original grid with current state to identify the changes, find the context around changes to restore the appropriate pixels, and apply different methods to solid and non-solid colors.
3.  **Dynamic Background Determination:**  We can not make assumptions about the background, we need to look at the edges of the images, and also identify the most common color across the entire grid.
4.  **Handle Color Variations:**  The code seems to be altering some colors, the code needs to account for and preserve the original colors.

**Example Metrics and Observations**

I'll use Python code to gather more precise information about the objects and discrepancies in each example.

```python
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

def get_objects(grid):
    """Identifies connected components (objects) in the grid."""
    objects = []
    visited = set()
    rows, cols = grid.shape

    def dfs(row, col, current_object):
        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < rows and 0 <= col < cols) or grid[row, col] == 0:
            return
        visited.add((row, col))
        current_object.append(((row, col), grid[row, col]))
        dfs(row + 1, col, current_object)
        dfs(row - 1, col, current_object)
        dfs(row, col + 1, current_object)
        dfs(row, col - 1, current_object)

    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            if grid[row, col] != 0 and (row, col) not in visited:
                current_object = []
                dfs(row, col, current_object)
                objects.append(current_object)
    return objects

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Analyzes discrepancies between expected and transformed outputs."""
    input_objects = get_objects(input_grid)
    expected_objects = get_objects(expected_output)
    transformed_objects = get_objects(transformed_output)
    
    input_colors = Counter(input_grid.flatten())
    expected_colors = Counter(expected_output.flatten())
    transformed_colors = Counter(transformed_output.flatten())

    print("Input Objects:", len(input_objects))
    print("Expected Objects:", len(expected_objects))
    print("Transformed Objects:", len(transformed_objects))
    print("---")

    print("Input Colors:", input_colors)
    print("Expected Colors:", expected_colors)
    print("Transformed Colors:", transformed_colors)
    print("---")


    pixels_off = np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)
    print(f"Pixels Off: {pixels_off}")

    match = np.array_equal(expected_output,transformed_output)
    print(f"Match: {match}")

    size_correct = transformed_output.shape == expected_output.shape
    print(f"Size Correct: {size_correct}")

    # Check color palette (unique colors)
    expected_colors_set = set(expected_colors.keys())
    transformed_colors_set = set(transformed_colors.keys())
    color_palette_correct = expected_colors_set == transformed_colors_set
    print("Color Palette Correct:", color_palette_correct)
    # check counts
    correct_pixel_counts = expected_colors == transformed_colors
    print(f"Correct Pixel Counts: {correct_pixel_counts}")

    print("\n")
