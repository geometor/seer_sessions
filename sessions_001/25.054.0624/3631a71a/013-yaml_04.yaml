facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are the same size (30x30).
  - object: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 30x30
      - elements: Pixels
  - object: Pixel
    properties:
      - color: Integer (0-9) representing a color.
  - observation: |
      Large connected regions of the same color tend to be preserved in the output.
  - observation: |
      Isolated or small clusters of pixels are often removed or changed.
  - observation: |
     The central 9x9 area appears to be "cleaned", with inner color sections mostly replaced by the surrounding color.
  - observation: The output looks like it has had some 3x3 "sweeps" over it to find the dominant color.
  - action: Noise Reduction
    description: |
      Small, isolated pixel groups are replaced based on the colors of surrounding pixels.
  - action: Shape Preservation
    description: |
      Large contiguous areas of the same color are maintained.
  - relation: |
      The output appears to be a simplified, less noisy version of the input.
  - relation: |
      9's in lower left corner are almost completely removed.
