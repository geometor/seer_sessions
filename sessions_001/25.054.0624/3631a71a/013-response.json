The most obvious initial observation is a complex, seemingly symmetrical pattern in the input grid.  The output grid appears to be a simplified or \"cleaned\" version of the input. It seems like large, connected regions of the same color are largely preserved, while smaller, isolated, or \"noisy\" pixels are removed or replaced, often based on surrounding colors. The transformation may involve a noise reduction and simplification while preserving prominent connected shapes. There are many instances of a 3x3 sections replaced with either all of the middle color, or all with a surrounding color.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
