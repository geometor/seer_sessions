The input and output grids have the same dimensions (30x30). Visual inspection reveals that many pixels retain their color and position, while some others change, and there are noticeable regions and shapes. The most obvious changes appear to relate to the color of connected regions. The output grid appears to have had its objects simplified and any color that appeared only once inside the region has been changed to a neighboring color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
