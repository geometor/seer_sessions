            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example, which explains why it doesn't generalize well to the other examples. The core issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Maroon Object Handling:** The code assumes there's only *one* large maroon object to preserve. Other examples have multiple maroon objects, and smaller ones should also be preserved.\n2.  **2x2 Green Square Logic:** The original code attempted to preserve all original pixel around all 2x2 green square, but only the largest green 2x2 square in term of area should be preserved.\n3. **Missing Colors:** The original natural language program didn't mentioned anything about colors other than green and maroon.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Instead of just identifying the \"largest\" maroon object, identify *all* maroon objects and only replace maroon pixels that are not part of any object.\n2. **Change Green Pixel Logic**: Iterate all green 2x2 square object, if an object it found, store it, and find for the largest area one. Replace other pixels that aren't part of the object, if existed.\n3. **Color Preservation:** Look for other colors and how it should be transformed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies and relevant object properties:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Pixels Off:** 87\n*   **Size Correct:** True\n*    **Color Palette Correct:** False\n*   **Correct Pixel Counts**: False\n*   **Observation:** Many maroon(9) pixels were incorrectly changed to white (0). Also, the logic of all green pixels preservation is wrong, and all the maroon colors are gone.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Pixels Off:** 41\n*   **Size Correct:** True\n*   **Color Palette Correct**: False\n*    **Correct Pixel Counts**: False\n*   **Observation:** Similar to Example 1, maroon pixels are disappearing. The green square logic is still incorrect.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Pixels Off:** 41\n*   **Size Correct:** True\n*   **Color Palette Correct**: False\n*    **Correct Pixel Counts**: False\n*   **Observation:**  Same issues as previous examples.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n*   **Pixels Off:** 66\n*   **Size Correct:** True\n*   **Color Palette Correct:** False\n*   **Correct Pixel Counts**: False\n*   **Observation:**  Same issues, plus some other incorrect pixel changes.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: 9  # Maroon\n    type: multiple_objects\n    action: preserve_all\n\n  - color: 3  # Green\n    type: 2x2_square\n    action: preserve_largest_area\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Iterate through the input grid.\n2.  Identify all maroon (9) objects.\n3.  Identify all 2x2 green (3) squares, and find the largest one by area.\n4. Transform all colors in input grid that are not belongs to maroon objects and the largest 2x2 green squares to themself in output grid.\n5.  Output the modified grid.\n"
