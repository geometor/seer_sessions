Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain nested rectangles of different colors. The output grid seems to be a highly compressed representation of the input, retaining only the core structure of the nested rectangles, and the innermost shape.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 22x22
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - description: Contains nested rectangles of colors green(3), azure(8), red(2) and blue(1)

  - name: Output Grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - description: A compressed representation of the nested rectangles, maintaining positional information.
  - name: Outer Rectangle
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: green(3)
      - description: Encloses the entire grid
  - name: second Rectangle
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: azure(8)
      - description: inside green
  - name: third Rectangle
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: red(2)
      - description: inside azure
 - name: Center
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - description: inside red

actions:
  - name: Compress
    description: Reduce the grid size while preserving the core nested structure and colors.

relationships:
  - Input Grid contains nested rectangles.
  - Output Grid represents a compressed version of the Input Grid.
  - The colors and relative positions of the rectangles are maintained during compression.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Nested Rectangles:** Locate the nested rectangular shapes within the input grid. Note their colors (green, azure, red, blue) and nesting order (green outermost, blue innermost).
2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** A consistent, smaller grid that maintains the positional information of the main shapes in the original grid. In this example 7x7.
3.  **Create Compressed Structure:** Represent the outermost green rectangle by a green border of the grid.
4. Represent the azure rectangle by an azure border inside of the green border.
5. Represent the red rectangle by a red border inside of the azure border.
6. Represent the blue center as a single blue pixel within the red.

In essence, the transformation extracts the core "skeleton" of nested rectangles and their colors, discarding the redundant pixels within each rectangle's area. The output grid is like a zoomed-out, schematic view of the input grid's nested structure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
