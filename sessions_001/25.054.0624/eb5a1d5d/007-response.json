The input grid appears to be a large rectangle composed of two colors: gray (5) and magenta (6).  The magenta region is a smaller, centered rectangle within the larger gray rectangle. The output grid is significantly smaller and seems to represent a highly abstracted version of the input. It appears the output is a 3x3 representation of the input image.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
