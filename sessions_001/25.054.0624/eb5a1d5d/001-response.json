The input grid appears to contain nested rectangles of different colors (represented by digits). The output grid seems to be a highly condensed representation of the input, focusing on the central colored regions. Specifically, it seems the innermost rectangles are represented in the output. It is important to consider the colors and the positions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Find next outer rectangle color: find the color of the rectangle enclosing the inner most one.\n4.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 5x5 output grid.\n5.  **Populate Output:**\n    *   Fill the border (outermost row and column) of the output grid with the color of the outermost rectangle in the input grid (color 8 in the example).\n    * Set the central pixel (row 3, column 3) to the color of the innermost rectangle.\n    * Set the other inner pixels to the color of the rectangle that encloses the inner most.\n\nEssentially the rule isolates the structure defined by the innermost two rectangles. It is a reduction of the larger grid to a minimal representation based on the \"core\", and the size of the minimal representation is fixed at 5x5.\n"
