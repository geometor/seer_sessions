"""
1. Locate 4x4 Block: Find the 4x4 block of pixels in the lower-right region of the input grid. This block contains all or most of the non-background (non-zero) colors present in the entire input grid.
2. Extract Rows: Extract each row of the 4x4 block as a separate list.
3. Drop Row: If the first and second rows of the input 4x4 block contain all the same values, and those are the background color, drop the first row.
4. Circular Shift Right: For each extracted row (after potentially dropping one), perform a circular shift to the right.  This means moving the last element of the row to the beginning.
5. Construct Output Grid: Create the output grid by combining the shifted rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
