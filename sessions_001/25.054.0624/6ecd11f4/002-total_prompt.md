<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1344x1728 at 0x70FFF4B4B0D0>

**output:**
```
3 0 7
0 8 0
3 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70FFF4B4BD30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (27x21) containing multiple colored regions. There are large areas of white (0), and two prominent shapes: one blue (1) in the upper-middle and a smaller, multi-colored shape in the lower portion. The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing a subset of the colors and values from a specific region in the lower section of the input. The transformation seems to involve extracting a specific 3x3 subgrid from the input, defined by colored pixels and their values.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 27x21
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All colors present
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 3, 6, 7, 8] # Colors from lower region

  - type: region
    description: blue shape
    properties:
      color: 1
      location: upper-middle

  - type: region
    description: multicolored shape
    properties:
      colors: [2,3,4,6,7,8,9]
      location: lower-middle

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: Extracting a 3x3 region from the input.

relationships:
    - The output grid's colors and values correspond to a specific 3x3 region in the input grid.
    - The 3x3 region to extract does not include any pixels of value 1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Target Region:** Identify the multi-colored region in the lower part of the input grid. Specifically find a 3x3 subgrid.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the pixel values within this 3x3 subgrid.
3.  **Form Output:** Construct a 3x3 output grid using the extracted pixel values.

In essence, the program describes a subgrid extraction process. The core logic revolves around finding a specific colored section (multicolored) region and copying the corresponding pixel array.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
