1.  **Locate Target Region:** Scan the input grid from the bottom up. Find a rectangular region of non-zero colored pixels. This region is likely bordered by zero-colored pixels, at least above it. The region can vary in size like 3x3 or 4x4.

Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of finding a rectangular region at the bottom and extracting it *almost* works for the first two examples, getting the size correct but failing to match all the correct colors and positions. However, Example 3 dramatically fails, highlighting a fundamental flaw: the code isn't just extracting the colored region, it's also including large areas of background (black/0) pixels above and to the left and right. The initial strategy is on the right track in terms of *identifying* the target region, but the handling of 0 (black/background color) is incorrect. Also, the position of non-zero colored pixels in the selected block is not considered.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Region Selection:** The current `find_target_region` function incorrectly includes large areas of the background. It needs to more tightly bound the non-zero colored pixels. Instead of just finding any non-zero pixel in a row, it should find contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels.
2. **Correct Color Replacement**: The position/index of each color except 0 must be considered.
3. **Revisit Example 3**: Example 3 includes the same problem and the output height is less than the input height.

**Metrics and Observations (using the provided outputs):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   `pixels_off`: 4 (Indicates 4 pixels differ between expected and transformed output)
    *   `size_correct`: True (Output grid has the same dimensions as the expected output)
    *   `color_palette_correct`: False.
    *  `correct_pixel_counts`: False
*   **Example 2:**
    *   `pixels_off`: 3
    *   `size_correct`: True
    *   `color_palette_correct`: False
    *    `correct_pixel_counts`: False

*   **Example 3:**
    *   `pixels_off`: None
    *   `size_correct`: False
    *   `color_palette_correct`: False
    *   `correct_pixel_counts`: False

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Target Region:** Scan the input grid to identify the smallest rectangular region containing *all* non-zero (non-black) colored pixels. This region is defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices that contain any non-zero pixel.

2.  **Extract Region:** Copy the pixel values within the identified rectangular region.

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid with the exact dimensions (height and width) of the extracted region.

4. **Arrange:** Maintain the position of non-zero pixels from the input and set all other values to zero.

5.  **Output:** Return the extracted output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
