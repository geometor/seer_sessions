            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies green pixels and attempts to change adjacent white pixels to yellow. However, it has a critical flaw: it changes *all* adjacent pixels to yellow, regardless of their original color, and it extends diagonally, not just horizontally and vertically. The examples clearly demonstrate that only *originally white* pixels adjacent to green pixels should change, and only in the horizontal and vertical directions. The program needs to be very strict in application of color changes.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Restrict Color Change:** Modify the code to check if an adjacent pixel is white (0) *before* changing it to yellow (4).\n2.  **Limit Adjacency**: Ensure only up, down, left and right directions are considered neighbors. Diagonal neighbors need to be excluded.\n3. Review Edge Cases: I am concerned about pixels at the edges. I need to make sure that the logic does not cause errors. I want to make sure to consider this edge case.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on where the code's logic deviates from the expected output:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** The code incorrectly changes several white pixels to yellow where they are diagonally adjacent to green. It also propagates changes too far - if a white pixel is changed to yellow, then *its* neighbors are also changed if white. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Metrics:** 10 pixels are incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:** Similar to Example 1, the code changes diagonally adjacent white pixels and propagates changes incorrectly.\n    *   **Metrics:** 25 pixels are incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Observation:** Same issue as previous examples: incorrect diagonal changes and propagation.\n    *    **Metrics:** 29 pixels are incorrect.\n\n*    **Example 4:**\n    *    **Observation:** Same issue: diagonal changes and incorrect propagation.\n    *   **Metrics:** 34 pixels incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   **Observation:** This complex case highlights the propagation error significantly. It also confirms that *only* white pixels turn yellow.\n    *   **Metrics:** 101 pixels are incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Represents the input and output images.\n  - name: pixel\n    type: cell\n    properties:\n      color:\n        type: integer\n        values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n      position:\n        type: tuple\n        description: (row, column) coordinates.\n      adjacency:\n        type: list\n        description: List of adjacent pixel positions (up, down, left, right).\n  - name: green_pixel\n    type: pixel\n    description: A pixel with color value 3.\n  - name: white_pixel\n    type: pixel\n    description: A pixel with color value 0.\n  - name: yellow_pixel\n    type: pixel\n    description: A pixel with the color value 4\n\nactions:\n  - name: find_pixels\n    input: [grid, color]\n    output: list of pixel positions\n    description: Locates all pixels of a specific color.\n  - name: get_adjacent\n    input: [grid, pixel position]\n    output: list of adjacent pixel positions\n    description: Finds adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) for a given pixel.\n  - name: change_color\n    input: [grid, pixel position, color]\n    output: modified grid\n    description: Changes the color of a specific pixel in the grid, but only from white to yellow if adjacent to green.\n  - name: transform\n    input: input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n    description: Applies the transformation logic (find green, check adjacent white pixels, change to yellow)\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Green:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are colored green (value 3).\n2.  **Find Adjacent Pixels:** For each green pixel, locate its immediate neighbors. Neighbors are defined as the pixels directly above, below, to the left, and to the right (not diagonal).\n3.  **Conditional Color Change:** For each neighboring pixel:\n    *   If the neighboring pixel is white (value 0), change its color to yellow (value 4).\n    *   If the neighboring pixel is *not* white, leave it unchanged.\n4.  **Output:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with only the specified color changes applied. All other pixels remain their original color.\n"
