Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a revised natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies green pixels and attempts to change adjacent white pixels to yellow. However, it has a critical flaw: it changes *all* adjacent pixels to yellow, regardless of their original color, and it extends diagonally, not just horizontally and vertically. The examples clearly demonstrate that only *originally white* pixels adjacent to green pixels should change, and only in the horizontal and vertical directions. The program needs to be very strict in application of color changes.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Restrict Color Change:** Modify the code to check if an adjacent pixel is white (0) *before* changing it to yellow (4).
2.  **Limit Adjacency**: Ensure only up, down, left and right directions are considered neighbors. Diagonal neighbors need to be excluded.
3. Review Edge Cases: I am concerned about pixels at the edges. I need to make sure that the logic does not cause errors. I want to make sure to consider this edge case.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on where the code's logic deviates from the expected output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Observation:** The code incorrectly changes several white pixels to yellow where they are diagonally adjacent to green. It also propagates changes too far - if a white pixel is changed to yellow, then *its* neighbors are also changed if white. This is incorrect.
    *   **Metrics:** 10 pixels are incorrect.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Observation:** Similar to Example 1, the code changes diagonally adjacent white pixels and propagates changes incorrectly.
    *   **Metrics:** 25 pixels are incorrect.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Observation:** Same issue as previous examples: incorrect diagonal changes and propagation.
    *    **Metrics:** 29 pixels are incorrect.

*    **Example 4:**
    *    **Observation:** Same issue: diagonal changes and incorrect propagation.
    *   **Metrics:** 34 pixels incorrect.

*   **Example 5:**
    *   **Observation:** This complex case highlights the propagation error significantly. It also confirms that *only* white pixels turn yellow.
    *   **Metrics:** 101 pixels are incorrect.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are colored green (value 3).
2.  **Find Adjacent Pixels:** For each green pixel, locate its immediate neighbors. Neighbors are defined as the pixels directly above, below, to the left, and to the right (not diagonal).
3.  **Conditional Color Change:** For each neighboring pixel:
    *   If the neighboring pixel is white (value 0), change its color to yellow (value 4).
    *   If the neighboring pixel is *not* white, leave it unchanged.
4.  **Output:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, with only the specified color changes applied. All other pixels remain their original color.
