        type: list
        description: List of adjacent pixel positions (up, down, left, right).
  - name: green_pixel
    type: pixel
    description: A pixel with color value 3.
  - name: white_pixel
    type: pixel
    description: A pixel with color value 0.
  - name: yellow_pixel
    type: pixel
    description: A pixel with the color value 4

actions:
  - name: find_pixels
    input: [grid, color]
    output: list of pixel positions
    description: Locates all pixels of a specific color.
  - name: get_adjacent
    input: [grid, pixel position]
    output: list of adjacent pixel positions
    description: Finds adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right) for a given pixel.
  - name: change_color
    input: [grid, pixel position, color]
    output: modified grid
    description: Changes the color of a specific pixel in the grid, but only from white to yellow if adjacent to green.
