The primary colors involved are white (0) and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a change of color in a specific pattern. The green pixels in the input seem to be the focal points for the transformation. Specifically, yellow (4) pixels appear in the output adjacent to green pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
