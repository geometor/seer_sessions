            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a very limited understanding, focusing on two maroon rectangles and applying specific transformations (recoloring parts and filling adjacent areas). The results across the four examples show that this approach is incorrect. The code fails to generalize and produces outputs significantly different from the expected outputs. The main issue seems to be a rigid, hardcoded transformation that doesn't adapt to the varying sizes and positions of the maroon rectangles, nor does it capture the overall pattern of color changes. The filling of additional colored pixels is also not correctly done.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Examples:** Discard the initial, overly specific hypothesis. Focus on identifying common patterns and relationships across *all* examples, not just the first one.\n2.  **Identify Objects and Actions:** Clearly define the objects involved (maroon rectangles) and the actions performed on them (recoloring, surrounding with other colors).\n3.  **Generalized Transformation:** Describe the transformation in a way that applies regardless of the rectangles' size or specific location. Look at surrounding and relative positions.\n4. **Consider filling operations** Look at what determines how fill operations should be performed.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of observations from each example, focusing on object properties and actions:\n\n| Example | Input Objects                | Actions                                                     | Errors/Notes                                                                                                         |\n| :------ | :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | Two 2x2 maroon rectangles     | Partial recolor to blue/green; green/blue fill around them  | Incorrect recoloring;  incorrect fill; Most pixels are wrong                                         |\n| 2       | Two maroon rectangles (4x4, 2x2) | Partial recolor to blue/green; green/blue fill around them      |      Incorrect recoloring;  incorrect fill; Most pixels are wrong                                                                                                  |\n| 3       | Three maroon rectangles      | Partial recolor to blue/green; green/blue fill around them      |         Incorrect recoloring;  incorrect fill; Most pixels are wrong                                                                                               |\n| 4       | Three maroon rectangles         | Partial recolor to blue/green; green/blue fill around them      |      Incorrect recoloring;  incorrect fill; Most pixels are wrong                                                                                                     |\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: maroon_rectangle_1\n    color: maroon\n    shape: rectangle\n    properties:\n      - can_vary_size: true\n      - can_vary_position: true\n  - name: maroon_rectangle_2\n    color: maroon\n    shape: rectangle\n    properties:\n      - can_vary_size: true\n      - can_vary_position: true\n  - name: maroon_rectangle_3 #some inputs have three rectangles\n    color: maroon\n    shape: rectangle\n    properties:\n      - can_vary_size: true\n      - can_vary_position: true\n\nactions:\n  - name: recolor_partial\n    target: maroon_rectangle\n    details:\n      - change_part_to: blue\n      - change_part_to: green\n  - name: surround\n    target: maroon_rectangle\n    details:\n     - fill_with: blue\n     - fill_with: green\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Maroon Rectangles:** Find all maroon-colored rectangular objects within the input grid. There may be two or three.\n2.  **Partial Recolor (Inner):** Within each maroon rectangle:\n    *   Change the top-left quadrant, *if it exists*, to green. If the rectangle is only one row or column, leave maroon\n    *   Change the part of rectangle not changed to green, *if it exists*, to blue.\n3. **Partial Recolor Border:** Within each maroon rectangle:\n      * Change the top two rows to green, *if they exist*.\n      * Change the bottom two rows to green, *if they exist*.\n      * Change the left two columns to green, *if they exist*.\n      * Change the right two columns to green, *if they exist*.\n4.  **Surround with Colors:**\n    *   For the top-most and left-most rectangle, extend two columns to the right and fill with green.\n    * For the top-most and left-most rectangle, extend two rows down with blue.\n    *   For the bottom-most and right-most rectangle, extend two columns left and fill with blue\n    *   For the bottom-most and right-most rectangle, extend two rows up and fill with green\n\nThis natural language program provides a much more general and accurate description of the transformation, moving away from the rigid, example-specific approach of the initial attempt.\n"
