Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon/dark red (9), green (3), and blue (1). There are distinct maroon shapes in the input. The output seems to retain the maroon shapes but alters their surrounding context with green and blue colors. The shapes influence the colors around them. The output includes additional colors that weren't as prominent or organized in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: maroon_shape_1
    type: contiguous_region
    color: 9
    initial_position: [2,8]  # Top-left corner coordinates
    shape: rectangle
    dimensions: [4,4]
  - name: maroon_shape_2
    type: contiguous_region
    color: 9
    initial_position: [6,3]
    shape: rectangle
    dimensions: [2,2]
  - name: maroon_shape_3
    type: contiguous_region
    color: 9
    initial_position: [9, 13]
    shape: rectangle
    dimensions: [2,2]
  - name: green_background
    type: region
    color: 3
  - name: blue_background
    type: region
    color: 1

actions:
  - type: expand_region
    object: maroon_shape_1
    color_added: 3
    notes: expands up and to the left
  - type: expand_region
    object: maroon_shape_2
    color_added: 3
    notes: expands up and to the left

  - type: expand_region
      object: maroon_shape_3
      color_added: 1
      notes: expands up and to the left
  - type: expand_color_region
    start_color: 0
    new_color: 3
    direction: specific
    notes: "changes 0s above and beside certain 9 regions to 3, and other areas to 1"

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: above
    object1: maroon_shape_1
    object2: green_background
  - type: spatial
    relation: surrounds
    object1: green_background, blue_background
    object2: maroon_shapes

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Maroon Shapes:** Locate all contiguous regions of color 9 (maroon). These are rectangular shapes.

2.  **Green Expansion (Top-Left):**
    *   For the 4x4 and 2x2 maroon shapes on the left side of the grid, expand a region of color 3 (green) upwards and to the left.
    * The area of green is bound at the top and left by white.

3.  **Blue Expansion (Top-Right):**
      *   For the remaining maroon shape, create a new background using 1 (blue)
        in the area up and to the left

4. **Green fill:** Change white (0) cells above the top most maroon (9) shapes to green (3)

5. **Blue Fill:** Change white (0) cells in an area above and to the left of other
   maroon shapes using color blue (1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
