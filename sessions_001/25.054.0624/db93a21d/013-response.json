The input grid contains distinct maroon (9) colored rectangular shapes against a white (0) background. The output grid introduces new colors: green (3), blue (1), and retains the maroon (9) from the input. There appears to be a relationship between the locations and sizes of the maroon rectangles in the input and the colored regions in the output. The output grid seems to \"outline\" or \"frame\" the original maroon shapes with different colors and fill the area around the shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The blue shape is one pixel thick.\n5.  **Create Green Filling:** Starting from the top left corner, fill every white region with green until it connects with any other color.\n\n"
