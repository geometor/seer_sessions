            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code has several issues, leading to significant discrepancies between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs. The primary problems seem to stem from:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Outlining:** The `outline_rectangle` functions (all three versions) have flaws. They don't consistently create outlines as intended, sometimes extending beyond the boundaries, and sometimes creating outlines in white space where not supposed to. The with-gap outline logic is not handling all of the cases.\n\n2.  **Incorrect Filling:** The flood fill is too aggressive, and the code is not\n    correctly determining the limits of the filling operation.\n\n3. Incorrect assumption about sorting the rectangles.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Fix the rectangle finding logic**: there were errors in identifying and\n    iterating the correct cells for the rectangles, this is corrected now.\n\n2.  **Fix Outlining:** We need to rewrite the outlining logic to be pixel-perfect. Instead of iterating over ranges that might go out of bounds, we'll explicitly set the pixels for the outline based on the rectangle's dimensions, adding parameters to control thickness and, the gap when needed.\n\n3.  **Fix Filling:** We must add logic to consider all the colors in the grid as boundaries to stop the filling.\n\n4. **Refactor Rectangle sorting**:\n    - top-left rectangle means sort by row asc, col asc\n    - largest rectangle means sort by size desc\n    - right rectangle means sort by col desc\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for accurate counts):**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):\n    pixels_off = np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)\n    size_correct =
