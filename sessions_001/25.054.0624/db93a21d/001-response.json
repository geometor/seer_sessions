The input grid primarily contains white (0) and maroon (9) pixels, while the output grid introduces green (3) and blue (1) pixels in addition to the original colors. There appears to be a relationship between the placement of maroon pixels in the input and the placement of other colors in the output. Specifically, it seems like maroon regions are being \"outlined\" or \"bordered\" by green, and a new blue object is appearing seemingly where no objects were before.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
