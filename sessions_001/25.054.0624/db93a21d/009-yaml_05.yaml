observations:
  - object_type: maroon_rectangle
    description: Rectangular regions of color 9.
    properties:
      - bounding_box: Defines the top-left and bottom-right corners.
      - size: width and height of rectangle

  - action: fill_green
    description: Fill an area with color 3 (green).
    constraints:
      - bounded_by:  maroon rectangles, and white cells.
      - location:  Specifically above and to the left of certain maroon rectangles.

  - action: fill_blue
    description: Fill an area with color 1 (blue).
    constraints:
      - bounded_by:  maroon rectangles and grid edges.
      - location:  Specifically above and to the left of certain maroon objects.

  - action: fill_white_area
    description: Fill white regions above maroon with green or blue based on location relative to the bounding box.
    constraints:
      - color: Depends on other object properties and relative locations.
      - shape: defined by surrounding colored and white cells
