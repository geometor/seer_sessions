Within the yellow background, there are distinct colored objects (blue (1), red (2), magenta (6)). The output seems to modify these colored objects, possibly expanding or duplicating them, while maintaining their general shape and relative positions.  The key seems to be the interaction of these objects, especially where they touch.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

These are the \"colored shapes.\"  Each shape is identified by its unique color (1, 2, or 6).\n\n2. **Detect Contact Points:** For each colored shape, examine its perimeter (both side-by-side and diagonal neighbors). Identify any pixels where different colored shapes are adjacent.\n\n3. **Conditional Expansion - Blue (1):** If a blue shape touches another blue shape, do not expand the blue shape at that adjacency. If a blue shape touches shapes of a *different* color, then fill all adjacent yellow cells in the *entire grid* with the same color and value as the original colored shape.\n\n4. **Conditional Expansion - Red (2):** If a red shape touches other shapes of a *different* color, then extend a single continuous perimeter of the red shape around the the touching shape.\n\n5. **Conditional Expansion - Magenta (6):** If a magenta shape touches shapes of a *different* color, then fill any immediately adjacent yellow cells with the color of the magenta shape.\n\n6. **Background:** All remaining pixels retain their original yellow (4) color.\n\nKey differences between expansion rules:\n* Blue expands globally.\n* Red extends locally along the point of adjacency.\n* Magenta only extends to any adjacent yellow cells.\n"
