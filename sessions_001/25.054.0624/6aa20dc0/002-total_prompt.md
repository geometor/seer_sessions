Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, broken down into perceptions, a YAML fact block, and a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Background:** The majority of the input grid is filled with the color blue (represented by the number 1). This seems to be the background color.
*   **Objects:** There are isolated groups of pixels of other colors (red (2), green (3), and azure (8)). These appear to be distinct objects.
*   **Object Shapes:** Some objects are single pixels (e.g., the red and green ones in the top right of the input). Others are 2x2 squares (e.g., the red and green squares near the center and bottom). The azure (8) object at row 5, column 6 in the input is an "L" shape.
* **Changes between Input and Output:** The positions of the objects is mostly the same in the Input and output. The most notable change is the azure (8) colored pixels added to expand existing object.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - background:
      color: blue (1)
      description: Fills most of the grid.
  - objects:
      - color: red (2)
        shape: single pixel, 2x2 square
      - color: green (3)
        shape: single pixel, 2x2 square
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: L-shape, varies
  - transformation:
      - action: extend
        target: azure (8) objects
        condition: adjacent to existing azure (8)
        direction: outward, maintaining connectivity, 2x2 squares are grown to a 4x4 filling existing azure colored neighbors and expanding on to the blue background.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous groups of pixels that are not blue (1). These are the objects.
2.  **Locate Target color** Find all the objects of azure color (8).
3.  **Conditional Expansion:** Iterate through the azure objects. For the object with adjacent azure objects. Add azure color on top of adjacent, connected azure colored objects.
4.  **Expansion:** Expand the existing azure objects by filling any adjacent, blue(1) pixels, with azure, making them part of these objects. If the object is a 2x2 shape it becomes a 4x4.

In essence, the transformation expands any "azure" colored connected objects that are adjacent to each other.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
