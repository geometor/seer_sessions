example_1:
  objects:
    - color: 1  # Blue
      shape: large_background
      adjacent_to: [2, 8, 3]
    - color: 2  # Red
      shape: small_rectangle
      adjacent_to: [1]
    - color: 8  # Azure
      shape: small_rectangle
      adjacent_to: [1,2,3]
    - color: 3  # Green
      shape: small_rectangle
      adjacent_to: [1,8]
  transformation: "Background color changes to match adjacent objects, spreading outwards."

example_2:
  objects:
    - color: 4  # Yellow
      shape: large_background
      adjacent_to: [1, 6, 2]
    - color: 1  # Blue
      shape: small_cluster
      adjacent_to: [4,2,6]
    - color: 6 # Magenta
      shape: small_rectangle
      adjacent_to: [4,1]
    - color: 2 #red
      shape: small_rectangle
      adjacent_to: [4,1]
  transformation: "Background color changes to match adjacent object, spreading outwards. Overlap creates complex patterns"
example_3:
  objects:
    - color: 8  # Azure
      shape: large_background
      adjacent_to: [2, 3, 4]
    - color: 2 #red
      shape: small
      adjacent_to: [8,3]
    - color: 3 # green
      shape: small

      dominant: True
    - color: 4  # Yellow
      shape: small
      adjacent_to: [8,3]
  transformation: "Background color changes, with certain colors appearing dominant."
