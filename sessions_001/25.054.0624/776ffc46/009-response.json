            "text": "Okay, here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to improve the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code have a fundamental flaw: they are overly specific to the first training example and fail to generalize to the other examples. The core issue is the assumption about positioning and relative offsets are too rigid. The logic correctly identifies the need to find blue shapes, green shapes of the same configuration, and a surrounding gray shape, but the positional assumptions ( \"directly above it\" and calculations based on the gray object's and green shapes top left corner ) are incorrect.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to:\n\n1.  **Relax Positional Constraints:** Remove the assumption of \"directly above\". Instead, search for a matching green shape *anywhere* within the gray shape.\n2.  **Focus on Shape Matching:**  Emphasize the shape-matching aspect, regardless of absolute or relative position. The core rule is about the *existence* of a matching green shape inside a gray area, not its specific location relative to the blue shape.\n3. **Object Finding Improvement:** Ensure consistent object finding using a robust method, like DFS, which can account for irregular shapes.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, highlighting the discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Issue:** Fails to convert the blue '1' shapes to green '3' shapes. The \"directly above\" assumption is the main problem. It is looking for an offset match and not accounting for different potential locations of the top left pixel.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 10 (Indicates a significant number of incorrect pixels)\n        *   `match`: False\n        *   Notes: The expected change involves the lower three blue shapes and the lone blue square, but no changes were made to the provided output.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Issue:** Similar to Example 1, the positional constraint (\"directly above\") and the associated offset calculation prevents the correct transformation.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 18\n        *   `match`: False\n         *  Notes: The expected change involves the lower three blue shapes on the left, the lower three blue shapes connected by a single blue pixel, and the cluster of five blue pixels. The code did not apply any changes.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Issue:** The \"directly above\" condition and the hardcoded positional check fail. It looks for the green object in the wrong location.\n    *    **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 12\n        *   `match`: False\n        *   Notes: Similar pattern to example 1 and 2.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Issue:** The code does not correctly match blue shapes when the corresponding green shape is not directly above.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 9\n        *   `match`: False\n        *   Notes: Almost Identical pattern to previous examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - color: 1  # Blue\n    property: target_shape\n    description: Shapes that might change color.\n  - color: 3  # Green\n    property: reference_shape\n    description: Shapes determining the transformation condition.\n  - color: 5  # Gray\n    property: container_shape\n    description: Shapes that contain the reference shapes.\n\nactions:\n  - find_objects:\n    input: grid\n    output: list_of_objects\n    description: Identify all contiguous objects of the same color.\n  - match_shape:\n    input: target_shape, reference_shape\n    output: boolean\n    description: Check if a target shape has a matching reference shape.\n  - check_containment:\n    input: reference_shape, container_shape\n    output: boolean\n    description: Verify if a reference shape is fully contained within a container shape.\n  - transform_color:\n      input: target_object\n      condition: match_shape AND check_containment\n      action: change blue object to green.\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find Objects:** Identify all distinct, contiguous objects (shapes) in the grid.  An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color. Consider pixels connected, even diagonally.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on objects with colors blue (1), green (3), and gray (5).\n\n3.  **Gray Container:** For each gray (5) object, consider it a \"container\".\n\n4.  **Green Reference Shapes:** Within each gray container, identify all green (3) objects.  These are the \"reference shapes\".\n\n5.  **Blue Target Shapes:** Identify all blue (1) objects. These are the \"target shapes.\"\n\n6.  **Shape Matching and Transformation:** For each blue (1) object:\n    *   Compare its shape to *each* of the green (3) reference shapes *anywhere within any* gray container. The shapes must be identical in configuration but may be translated (located in different positions). The comparison should not rely on absolute position or a fixed offset between top-left corners.\n    *   If a shape match is found between the blue object and *any* green object *within any* gray container, change the color of all pixels in the matching blue object to green (3).\n\n7.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other objects that do not meet the above criteria remain unchanged. The background (color 0) also remains unchanged.\n"
