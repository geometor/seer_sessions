            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe current code attempts to move yellow objects adjacent to green objects. However, the strategy for moving yellow objects is flawed, as it simply uses the first green object found and its top-left position, rather than finding the _nearest_ green, and moving next to it. Also, it is attempting a 1:1 translation of the entire object, rather than moving individual pixels of the yellow object, and does not take into account obstacles, like azure or other colored objects.\nIt also does not account for cases where a yellow object may split when moved, and only moves relative to the yellow objects initial position.\n\nThe examples reveal the following issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Movement:** The yellow objects are not consistently moved to the closest available position adjacent to a green object. The current implementation seems to pick an arbitrary green object and uses that one location, leading to incorrect placement. It's clear that there's not a well-defined movement rule regarding obstacles.\n2.  **Object Integrity is not Preserved:** The relative position of the yellow object should be better preserved and only moved based on adjacent pixels.\n3. **Splitting:** in Example 3, the yellow objects are split because of obstacles and the simple movement rule.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Nearest Green:** Instead of simply using the location of the first encountered green object, we should move individual pixels of the yellow object to the nearest valid location, taking obstacles into account.\n2.  **Obstacle Handling:** Consider all colors as potential obstacles for movement.\n3. **Adjacent Pixel Movement**: Move each individual pixel of yellow object adjacent to the _nearest_ green.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Examples 1-3):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, incorporating observations:\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*   **Input:** Several yellow and green objects scattered, some large azure areas.\n*   **Expected Output:** Yellow objects moved next to green, preserving shape.\n*   **Actual Output:** Yellow objects only partially moved, no clear logic, large chunk of the yellow objects has disappeared and not preserved.\n*   **Mismatch:** 14 pixels. Many yellow pixels have disappeared.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*   **Input:** Many small yellow and green objects, some larger azure area in the middle.\n*   **Expected Output:** Yellow objects moved next to green.\n*   **Actual Output:** Very little movement, some green have changed to yellow\n*   **Mismatch:** 15 pixels. Many green pixels changed to yellow.\n\n*Example 3:*\n\n*   **Input:** large horizontal yellow rectangle, surrounded by green, some red.\n*   **Expected Output:** Yellow rectangle should split up and move to the nearest green, with yellow filling any open adjacent spots.\n*   **Actual Output:** No movement, and green has disappeared\n*   **Mismatch:** 18 pixels. Green pixels have disappeared.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example: 1\n    objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: variable\n        moved: true\n        movement_rule: adjacent_to_green\n        integrity: partially_preserved\n      - color: green\n        shape: variable\n        moved: false\n      - color: azure\n        shape: variable\n        moved: false\n    notes: \"Yellow objects should be moved next to green, preserving shape if possible. Current code moves incorrectly and removes parts of the yellow objects.\"\n\n  - example: 2\n    objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: variable\n        moved: true\n        movement_rule: adjacent_to_green\n        integrity: not_preserved\n      - color: green\n        shape: variable\n        moved: false\n      - color: azure\n        shape: variable\n        moved: false\n    notes: \"Yellow objects move very little. Many green objects are incorrectly colored yellow.\"\n\n  - example: 3\n    objects:\n      - color: yellow\n        shape: rectangle\n        moved: true\n        movement_rule: adjacent_to_green\n        integrity: not_preserved, splits into many parts\n      - color: green\n        shape: variable\n        moved: false\n    notes: \"The large yellow rectangle should be split to move parts adjacent to green.  Current implementation removes many green and makes no movement.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of yellow (4) and green (3) pixels in the input grid.\n2.  **Iterate Pixels**: Iterate through each pixel of each yellow object.\n3.  **Find Nearest Green:** For each yellow pixel, search for the nearest green pixel. \"Nearest\" is defined by the minimum number of moves (up, down, left, or right) required to reach a position that is adjacent to a green pixel without crossing other objects.\n4. **Move Yellow Pixels:** Move each yellow pixel to an available adjacent cell of the _nearest_ green pixel, if a position is free (value is 0).\n5. **Preserve:** Keep the relative shape of yellow objects intact as much as possible, moving individual pixels rather than entire objects at once.\n6.  **Obstacles:** Azure (8) pixels, red (2) pixels, and other yellow pixels act as obstacles - do not move through them.\n\n"
