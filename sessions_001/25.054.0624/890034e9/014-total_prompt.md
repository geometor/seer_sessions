Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are 21x21 grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   **Colors:** Multiple colors are present, including white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).
*   **Shapes:** There's a noticeable, irregular, somewhat circular shape formed by yellow (4) pixels in the center of the input grid. The same general shape made of yellow is recognizable in the output, although it seems to move around with some interference from other colors.
*   **Background:** The background is a noisy mix of red (2), green(3), white(0), and rarely blue(1).
*    **Change**: the yellow shape seems to remain unchanged between input and output, the only changes occur on the border of the yellow shape

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    description: The area of the image not part of the central shape.
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2, 3, 1] # White, Red, Green, Blue
      pattern: noisy, inconsistent

  - id: central_shape
    description: An irregular circular shape.
    properties:
      color: 4  # Yellow
      size: Varies, but substantial.
      position: Roughly centered.

  - id: border
    description: the pixels surrounding the central shape
    properties:
      colors: [0,2,3,4]

actions:
  - name: replace_color_at_border
    description: colors other than yellow change on the border of the central yellow shape
    parameters:
        border_pixel: the location of the pixel surrounding the central shape
        from_color: [0,2,3]
        to_color: [0,2,3,4]

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: grid
    to: [background, central_shape]
  - type: surrounds
    from: border
    to: central_shape

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Shape:** Locate the contiguous block of yellow (4) pixels that form the central, irregular circular shape.

2. **Identify Border Pixels:** the pixels surrounding the yellow shape

3. **Color replacement at Border:** For each pixel on the border of the shape, replace the colors other than yellow according to the following rules
    - find locations in the output grid where the colors are the same as in input grid
    - the colors at those locations in the output are preserved
    - all other border pixels are replaced by their values in the output

In essence, the transformation preserves the yellow shape and only modifies some colors on the border of the shape. The rest of the grid is untouched.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
