The transformation seems to involve a specific change related to the white (0) pixels. The most noticeable change is the replacement of some white pixels with red (2) pixels. The azure pixels remain unchanged. The position of the newly introduced red pixels seems very regular - every fifth column, starting at column index 4 (the fifth column if we start counting at index 0).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
