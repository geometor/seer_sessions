Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Identify Isolated Pixels:** Scan the input grid to find pixels that are not white (color 0) and are surrounded on all four sides (up, down, left, right) by either white pixels or the edge of the grid.

2.  **Create Plus Shapes:** For each isolated pixel:
    *   Extend the pixel's color horizontally to the left and right, stopping when a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered.
    *   Extend the pixel's color vertically up and down, stopping when a non-white pixel or the grid edge is encountered.
    * The result is a "plus" shape centered on the original isolated pixel's location.

3. **Output:** The transformed grid contains only plus-shaped objects created from these isolated pixels. If the horizontal and vertical extensions from different pixels overlap, the color of the horizontal extension in that cell is kept.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
