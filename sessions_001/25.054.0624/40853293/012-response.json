Stop the extension in each direction when a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.\n    *   Extend the pixel's color vertically, both up and down. Stop the extension in each direction when a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.\n\n3.  **Handle Overlaps:** If, during the extension, a pixel's extension would overwrite a pixel that is already part of *another* isolated pixel's extension, maintain the initial isolated pixel color.\n\n4. **Output:** The final grid will consist of these plus-shaped objects, potentially with some overlaps handled as described in step 3.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_isolated(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a pixel at (row, col) is isolated.\"\"\"\n    color = grid[row, col]\n    if color == 0:  # white pixels are not considered\n        return False\n\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n\n    if row > 0:\n        neighbors.append(grid[row - 1, col])  # Up\n    else:\n        neighbors.append(0)\n    if row < height - 1:\n        neighbors.append(grid[row + 1, col])  # Down\n    else:\n        neighbors.append(0)\n    if col > 0:\n        neighbors.append(grid[row, col - 1])  # Left\n    else:\n        neighbors.append(0)\n    if col < width - 1:\n        neighbors.append(grid[row, col + 1])  # Right\n    else:\n        neighbors.append(0)\n\n    for neighbor_color in neighbors:\n        if neighbor_color != 0:\n            return False  # Not isolated if any neighbor is not white\n\n    return True\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the rules.\"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)\n    height, width = input_grid.shape\n\n    isolated_pixels = []\n    for row in range(height):\n        for col in range(width):\n            if is_isolated(input_grid, row, col):\n                isolated_pixels.append((row, col, input_grid[row, col]))\n\n    for row, col, color in isolated_pixels:\n        output_grid[row, col] = color # Start with the isolated pixel itself\n\n        # Horizontal Extension\n        # Left\n        for c in range(col - 1, -1, -1):\n            if input_grid[row, c] == 0:\n                output_grid[row, c] = color\n            else:\n                break\n        # Right\n        for c in range(col + 1, width):\n            if input_grid[row, c] == 0:\n                output_grid[row, c] = color\n            else:\n                break\n\n        # Vertical Extension\n        # Up\n        for r in range(row - 1, -1, -1):\n            if input_grid[r, col] == 0:\n                output_grid[r, col] = color\n            else:\n                break\n        # Down\n        for r in range(row + 1, height):\n            if input_grid[r, col] == 0:\n                 output_grid[r, col] = color\n            else:\n                break\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
