            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the first attempt and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the hypothesis that the transformation involves removing the largest white (0) region and replacing it with the most frequent adjacent color. While the \"largest white region removal\" part seems correct in terms of the area affected, the replacement logic is flawed. The code replaces it with the most frequent color *adjacent* to the removed region, which is not consistent across all examples. Looking at the Expected Outputs vs Transformed Outputs the replacement color is not always adjacent, it's based on the colors in the entire grid.\n\nHere's the refined strategy:\n\n1.  **Confirm Object Identification:** Verify that identifying the largest connected region of white pixels is indeed the correct initial step. The consistent `size_correct: True` across examples reinforces this.\n2.  **Revise Replacement Rule:** The current adjacency-based replacement rule is incorrect. The examples suggest a global color analysis, not a local one. The replacement seems to use a global, most common color *other than* white, and consider edge cases.\n3. **Consider Edge Cases:** Check cases with no adjacent, non-white pixels.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (Using Code Execution)**\nI will write a quick python script to produce metrics to confirm.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)\n    transformed_output = np.array(transformed_output)\n\n    # 1.
