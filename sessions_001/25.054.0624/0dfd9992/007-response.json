The primary element is a 2D grid filled with single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There's a large, irregular white (0) shape in the center of the input, which is absent in the output. However, since the output is identical with input, it indicates that the white shape is probably not a significant object. The overall structure consists of various colored pixels arranged in rows and columns. No obvious motion, interaction, or animation is present within this single example.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
