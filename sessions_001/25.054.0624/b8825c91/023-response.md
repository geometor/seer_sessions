Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a reasonable hypothesis derived from the first training example: Azure (8) pixels change color based on adjacency to yellow (4) pixels, and yellow (4) pixels change to blue (1) when adjacent to magenta (6). However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule is overly simplistic and doesn't capture the full complexity of the transformation.  The numerous mismatches (pixels_off) in examples 2, 3, and 4 confirm this. The color changes are not consistent, and position/relative position logic is likely flawed and incomplete. Example 3 shows a large shift in expected colors that is very different than the other examples.

The current approach of using direct neighbor checks and hardcoded relative position rules is not robust enough. We need a more generalized approach that considers:
1.  The shape and structure of color-4 objects.
2.  The concept of the "edge" or border, and the relative position *within that border*.
3.  Review color palette and pixel counts.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the "Edge" Concept:** Instead of just checking immediate neighbors, we need to determine if an azure pixel is on the "edge" of a larger structure formed by color 4.
2.  **Refine Relative Positioning:** The current relative positioning (above, below, left, right) is too simplistic. We need to consider the context of the entire color-4 object.
3.  **Consider Alternative Transformations:** It's possible that there are other transformations happening that we haven't accounted for, not involving just colors 8, 4, and 6.
4.  **Object-Oriented Approach:** It may help to define objects (contiguous regions of the same color) explicitly, as this could allow us to analyze properties of these shapes and their borders more effectively.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for accuracy where possible):**

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(input_grid, expected_output, transformed_output):
    """Analyzes the transformation results."""

    match = np.array_equal(expected_output, transformed_output)
    pixels_off = np.sum(expected_output != transformed_output)
    size_correct = expected_output.shape == transformed_output.shape
    expected_colors = set(np.unique(expected_output))
    transformed_colors = set(np.unique(transformed_output))
    color_palette_correct = expected_colors == transformed_colors

    expected_counts = {color: np.sum(expected_output == color) for color in expected_colors}
    transformed_counts = {color: np.sum(transformed_output == color) for color in transformed_colors}
    correct_pixel_counts = expected_counts == transformed_counts

    results_string = (
        f"match: {match}\n"
        f"pixels_off: {pixels_off}\n"
        f"size_correct: {size_correct}\n"
        f"color_palette_correct: {color_palette_correct}\n"
        f"correct_pixel_counts: {correct_pixel_counts}\n"
        )

    return results_string
