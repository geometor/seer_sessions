Visually, the most prominent change is a \"diamond\" or \"rotated square\" shape in the center of the input grid, constructed of multiple colors. This shape seems to have been altered, or had a filter applied, in the output. The colors inside the diamond, and the color of its border, appear to be have changed, specifically, a central cross made of yellow changes to maroon, another inner cross of orange changes to blue.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
