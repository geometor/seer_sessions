It's likely related to specific color patterns, the presence of certain objects, or a dynamic size. Further analysis is required to determine the exact rule defining this region.\n\n2.  **Conditional Color Changes Within the Central Region:** Within the identified central region, the colors of certain pixels are transformed. The exact transformation rule is unknown and doesn't appear to be a simple one-to-one mapping. It may depend on surrounding pixel colors, position within the region, or other factors. We can observe colors 4,6,7,8,9,1, and 2 are changing.\n\n3.  **Preserve Outside Pixels:** All pixels outside the defined central region remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_central_region(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Attempts to identify the central region based on observed patterns.\n    This is a placeholder and needs to be significantly improved.
