Visual comparison reveals a 5x5 square at the center-right of the input grid, comprised of colors yellow (4), and azure (8) is replaced by blue (1), gray (5), azure(8), green(3) and maroon(9). This indicates a localized, color-based replacement rule. The rest of the grid remains unchanged, suggesting that the rule operates only on a specific, identifiable region.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
