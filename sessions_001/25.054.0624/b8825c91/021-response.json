            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and strategize for improvement.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a combination of area-specific transformations (the 5x5 square) and coordinate-specific changes.  The results clearly show this approach is incorrect.  It seems to be picking up *some* superficial patterns (changing yellow to blue in a region), but it's missing the core logic. The coordinate-specific changes are largely, if not entirely, wrong.\n\nThe consistent failure across multiple examples indicates a fundamental flaw in the understood rule. Instead of trying to patch the existing coordinate-based rules, we should shift our focus. It seems like the intended changes happen in more local area. Looking at the diffs, It looks like changing colors of objects adjacent to others.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Discard Coordinate-Specific Rules:** The coordinate-specific rules are not reliable and should be abandoned.\n2.  **Focus on Local Object Interactions:** Re-examine the examples, paying close attention to relationships between *adjacent* objects (groups of pixels of the same color). The transformations likely involve changes based on the colors of neighboring pixels.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Color Changes:** The yellow-to-blue rule might be a coincidence or a partial rule. We need to re-evaluate *all* color changes in the context of neighboring colors.\n4. Use all four example transformations, not just the first, to develop the program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example)**\n\nI will use text analysis of my previous results. I cannot use `code_execution` in\nthis 'dream' phase, so I will rely on the visual output and pixel counts.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Many yellow pixels were incorrectly changed to blue.\n    *   The specific azure changes were almost entirely wrong.\n    *   Pixels off: 21\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Fewer yellow pixels, but changes in the lower area.\n    *   Fewer off by coordinate changes\n    *   Pixels off: 12\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Bottom left 4x4 square of 4s. Many changed to 1s.\n    *   The specific azure changes were almost entirely wrong.\n    *   Pixels off: 24\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Area of 4s and some other changes.\n    *   The specific azure changes were entirely wrong.\n    *   Pixels off: 13\n\n**YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: 9 # Multiple objects of various colors\n        - color: 6\n        - color: 5\n        - color: 1\n        - color: 7\n        - color: 3\n        - color: 8\n        - color: 4 # Yellow, potentially a target\n      output_objects:\n        - color: 9\n        - color: 6\n        - color: 5\n        - color: 1\n        - color: 7\n        - color: 3\n        - color: 8\n      changes:\n        - from: 4 # Yellow\n          to: 1   # Blue, in a large group, but some are not\n        - from: 8\n          to: [5,3,9]  # conditional based on an unknown\n          \n  - example_2:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: [9, 6, 1, 8, 2, 5, 7, 4]\n      output_objects:\n        - color: [9, 6, 1, 8, 2, 5, 7, 3]\n      changes:\n        - from: 4 # Yellow\n          to: 1   # Blue in several cases, but not always - top area\n        - from: 4\n          to: 5\n        - from: 8\n          to: [2,9] #conditional on unknown\n  - example_3:\n      input_objects:\n        - color: [9, 3, 2, 8, 7, 5, 1, 6, 4]\n      output_objects:\n        - color: [9, 3, 2, 8, 7, 5, 1, 6]\n      changes:\n        - from: 4\n          to: [1,2]\n        - from: 8\n          to: [5,3] #conditional\n\n  - example_4:\n      input_objects:\n        - colors: [2, 7, 6, 8, 9, 1, 5, 3, 4] # Multiple objects\n      output_objects:\n        - colors: [2, 7, 6, 8, 9, 1, 5, 3]\n      changes:\n        - from: 4\n          to: [1,6]\n        - from: 8 # Azure\n          to: 3   # Green, conditional\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure (8) Pixels:** Locate all pixels that are azure (color 8).\n2.  **Conditional Changes based on adjacent colors**\n    *   If an azure (8) pixel is adjacent to the edge of an object of color 4, the\n        azure pixel might change to a different color, such as 3,5,9, based on\n        relative position.\n    *   If a pixel of color 4 is adjacent to an object of color 6, change to a 1.\n\nThis program focuses on local interactions and avoids making assumptions about global coordinates. It emphasizes the conditional nature of the transformations, which depend on the immediate neighbors of a pixel. The exact conditions for the azure pixel changes still need to be determined, but this framework is more likely to succeed than the previous one.\n"
