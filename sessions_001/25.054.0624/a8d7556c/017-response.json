            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code execution and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the core concept: changing white pixels to red based on adjacency to gray pixels. However, it's overly sensitive and changes white pixels to red even when those pixels are part of a small group (less than three white pixels). The errors are related to where exactly it changes pixels and suggests errors in how it uses adjacency. Examining each example closely shows many pixels are incorrectly transformed, implying both type 1 and type 2 errors.\n\nThe original prompt states that only white regions with *more than two pixels*\nshould be affected, but the examples show that it is not universally true\nbecause smaller regions ARE transformed when adjacent to grey. It appears that\nall white pixels adjacent to gray are changed to red, regardless of size.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Adjacency Calculation:** Double-check the `is_adjacent_to_gray` function. The provided code correctly checks only orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n2.  **Re-evaluate Region Size Constraint:** The original constraint of \"more than two pixels\" is NOT consistent across the examples. We will eliminate this from the natural language program.\n3.  **Analyze Errors:** Examine the mismatched pixels to understand any missed edge cases or subtle rules. It seems there are no special edge cases at the boundary of the grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using `code_execution` where appropriate):**\nSince this is the dreamer phase, I will simulate running the code. I have the results, so I won't rerun the code but use the results as if I did.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   `pixels_off`: 69.  This is a large number of errors, indicating a systemic issue.\n    *   The errors seem to cluster around gray pixels, but some eligible white pixels aren't changed, and some ineligible ones are.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   `pixels_off`: 98. Even more errors than the first example.\n    *   Similar error pattern as example 1, reinforcing the conclusion of a systemic issue.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    `pixels_off`: 62\n    *    Similar error pattern as previous examples.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: white_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: 0\n      state: changeable\n      adjacency:\n        to: gray_pixel\n        type: orthogonal\n    actions:\n      change_color:\n        to: red\n        condition: adjacent_to_gray\n\n  - object: gray_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: 5\n      state: static\n    actions: {}\n\n  - object: other_pixel\n    properties:\n      state: static\n    actions: {}\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify all white (0) pixels.\n2.  For each white pixel, check for orthogonal adjacency (up, down, left, right) to a gray (5) pixel.\n3.  If a white pixel is orthogonally adjacent to a gray pixel, change its color to red (2).\n4.  All other pixels remain unchanged.\n"
