objects:
  - name: white_shape
    color: 0
    description: The primary shape(s) in the input.  Can be irregular.
    role: seed for the fill
  - name: gray_background
    color: 5
    description: The background color that will be partially filled.
    role: background
  - name: red_fill
    color: 2
    description: The color used to fill parts of the gray background.
    role: fill
  - name: grid
    description: 2d array, the entire input

actions:
  - name: find_adjacent
    input: white_shape, gray_background
    output: adjacent_pixels
    description: Identifies gray pixels directly adjacent (orthogonally and diagonally) to the white shape.
  - name: fill
    input: adjacent_pixels, gray_background
    output: modified_grid
    description: Changes the color of the identified adjacent gray pixels to red.
  - name: preserve_shape
    input: white_shape, input_grid
    output: output_grid, white_shape
    description: ensure the shape of the white area stays the same between input and output

rules:
  - adjacency: Includes orthogonal (up, down, left, right) and diagonal neighbors.
  - fill_limit: Only gray pixels directly adjacent to white pixels are filled.  Fill does not propagate beyond the initial adjacent pixels.
  - boundary: Filling stops at the edges of the grid.
