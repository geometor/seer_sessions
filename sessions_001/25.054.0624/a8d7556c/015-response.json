            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying connected white regions and changing *some* white pixels to red was a good starting point. However, the selection criteria for which white pixels to change are clearly too naive. The \"Transformed Output\" images show inconsistent and incorrect placement of the red pixels compared to the \"Expected Output\". We need a more precise rule to determine the placement of red pixels within the white regions. The failures appear to be about pixel selection strategy.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Gather More Detailed Metrics:** We need to understand *where* the red pixels are placed within each white region. Are they at the edges, the center, or following some other pattern relative to the surrounding non-white pixels? We should examine the coordinates of the correctly and incorrectly changed pixels.\n2.  **Refine Selection Logic:** Based on the detailed metrics, we'll adjust the pixel selection strategy within the `transform` function. The current arbitrary selection of `region[1]` and `region[2]` needs to be replaced with a rule based on the observed pattern. It might involve relative position.\n3.  **Consider surrounding pixels:** The solution might consider adjacent or nearby pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example-by-Example):**\n\nI'll use a bit of manual observation, aided by looking at the output images.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Expected Output:** Red pixels seem to form a \"thick\" outline or partial fill within the larger white areas, often adjacent to gray (5) pixels.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Red pixels are somewhat random, often not adjacent to gray, and sometimes form lines where they shouldn't.\n* The connected regions greater than size 2 requirement makes some sense.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Expected Output:** Similar to Example 1, red pixels fill in parts of larger white areas, mostly near gray pixels.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Again, incorrect and sporadic placement of red pixels.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Expected Output:** The pattern of red pixels relative to white and gray areas is consistent with the other examples.\n*   **Transformed Output:** Similar issues to the previous examples; the red pixel selection is not matching the expected output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 014-py_07\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: [18, 18]\n          colors: [0, 2, 5]  # white, red, gray\n      - type: connected_region\n        properties:\n          color: 0  # white\n          shape: irregular\n        actions:\n          - change_color:\n              to: 2  # red\n              selection_rule: \"adjacent to color 5\" # gray\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: [18, 18]\n          colors: [0, 2, 5]\n      - type: connected_region\n        properties:\n          color: 0\n          shape: irregular\n        actions:\n          - change_color:\n              to: 2\n              selection_rule: \"adjacent to color 5\"\n  - example_id: 3\n    objects:\n      - type: grid\n        properties:\n          dimensions: [18, 18]\n          colors: [0, 2, 5]\n      - type: connected_region\n        properties:\n          color: 0\n          shape: irregular\n        actions:\n          - change_color:\n              to: 2\n              selection_rule: \"adjacent to color 5\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify all connected regions of white (0) pixels.\n2.  For each white region with more than two pixels:\n    *   Change white pixels to red (2) if they are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right, *not diagonal*) to a gray (5) pixel.\n3. Leave all other pixels unchanged.\n"
