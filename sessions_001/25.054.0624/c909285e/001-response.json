The output is a much smaller grid, also of colored pixels. The colors in the output grid appear to be a subset of the colors in the input grid. The output grid seems to represent a simplified or \"extracted\" version of a pattern within the input grid. The input has repeating patterns, and the output appears to be a single instance of the repeating unit. The input pattern is a 5x5 repeating object.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
