The output is a smaller grid that seems to be a \"zoomed-in\" and simplified representation of a section of the input grid. The colors in the output grid are present in the input, but not all colors from the input section are present in the output. The output appears to be a rectangular sub-region of the input. The surrounding context outside the output sub-region is ignored, but could have some bearing on determining *which* sub-region will be the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
