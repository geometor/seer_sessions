There are distinct regions of uniform color and repeating patterns within those regions. It appears some areas of the input may correspond to areas in the output.\n*   **Output:** The output is a much smaller grid, also composed of colored pixels. The output grid seems to extract a specific, smaller pattern present within the larger input grid, while potentially changing some pixel colors too, in particular changing all 5s to 6s.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve identifying and extracting a particular, recurring sub-grid (or \"object\") from the input, along with position translation and color substitution.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Surrounding border included in the input is not included in the output.\n\nEssentially, the program describes a \"find and extract, and then substitute\" process. We locate a specific repeating subgrid within the complex input, extract it, perform a color change and then that forms our simplified output.\n"
