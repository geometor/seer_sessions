The transformation seems to involve:\n\n1.  **Expansion:** The azure pixels expand, creating larger azure areas.\n2.  **Pattern Creation:** The expansion follows a specific pattern, seemingly creating vertical and horizontal lines, and filling in areas.\n3.  **Boundary Interaction:**. It appears the azure extends to the border of the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Create Vertical azure lines, extending up and down from each initial azure pixel, until another azure block or edge is hit. Fill all spaces in between with azure.\n4.  Create Horizontal azure lines, to the left and right of each initial azure pixel and the newly expanded vertical sections, until another azure block or edge is hit. Fill all spaces in between with azure.\n\nIn essence, the azure pixels act as seeds, growing lines and filling enclosed areas in a structured way. The key is the combination of vertical and horizontal expansion, and the filling operation, bounded by existing azure regions or the grid's edges.\n"
