Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially mostly white (0) with a few azure (8) pixels. The transformation seems to involve:

1.  **Expansion:** The azure pixels expand, creating larger azure areas.
2.  **Pattern Creation:** The expansion follows a specific pattern, seemingly creating vertical and horizontal lines, and filling in areas.
3.  **Boundary Interaction:**. It appears the azure extends to the border of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_pixel
    color: azure (8)
    initial_positions: [[2, 11], [5, 14], [8, 17]]
    properties:
      - expandable: true
      - direction: vertical and horizontal

  - name: white_pixel
    color: white (0)
    properties:
      - replaceable: true

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: azure_pixel
    constraints:
      - fill_available_space: true
      - create_lines: horizontal, vertical
      - border_expansion: true

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Azure pixels expand adjacently to other azure or white pixels.
  - type: replacement
    description: White pixels are replaced by expanding azure pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Expand** existing azure area vertically and horizontally by placing the new border of the output to be azure and filling the areas to be azure.
3.  Create Vertical azure lines, extending up and down from each initial azure pixel, until another azure block or edge is hit. Fill all spaces in between with azure.
4.  Create Horizontal azure lines, to the left and right of each initial azure pixel and the newly expanded vertical sections, until another azure block or edge is hit. Fill all spaces in between with azure.

In essence, the azure pixels act as seeds, growing lines and filling enclosed areas in a structured way. The key is the combination of vertical and horizontal expansion, and the filling operation, bounded by existing azure regions or the grid's edges.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
