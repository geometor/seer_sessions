examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: 8  # Azure
          shape: sparse, single pixels
          positions: scattered
      output_objects:
        - color: 8  # Azure
          shape: larger, filled square with some blank space around the border
          positions: covers most of the grid, follows border with empty cells
      transformations:
        - action: fill
          details: "Fill the grid based on an inferred boundary, using the input color, leaving blank cells around the edge of the boundary"

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: 2  # Red
          shape: sparse, single pixels
          positions: scattered
      output_objects:
        - color: 2  # Red
          shape: fills a row and outlines a larger square, leaving a border
          positions: second row, plus outlining shape
      transformations:
        - action: fill
          details: "Fill the grid based on the trigger color and outlining a square, leaving a blank space around the border"

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - color: 3  # Green
          shape: sparse, single pixels
          positions: scattered
      output_objects:
        - color: 3  # Green
          shape: Partial fill based on outlines with diagonals and partial borders
          positions: covers most of the grid following a pattern with blanks for cells which form part of a boundary
      transformations:
        - action: fill
          details: "Fill grid selectively, considering diagonals and borders created by trigger cells"
