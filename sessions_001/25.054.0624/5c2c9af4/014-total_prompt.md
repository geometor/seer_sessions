Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid contains isolated green (3) pixels scattered across a background of white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to construct a rectangular border around each isolated green pixel, extending both vertically and horizontally. The green pixels are maintained. There's also an apparent "filling" operation happening within the areas bounded, but it's constrained by the single green pixel. It is an "expansion" of green pixels within constraints.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_pixel
    color: green
    value: 3
    properties:
      - isolated: true  # Indicates it's not directly adjacent to other green pixels
      - surrounded: true #in output

  - name: white_pixel
    color: white
    value: 0
    properties:
      - background: true

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: green_pixel
    description: Expands outwards horizontally and vertically, changing white pixels to green.
    constraints:
        - limited to single expansion in straight lines

  - name: constrain
    agent: edge
    description: limit the fill to within a specific area.

relationships:
  - subject: green_pixel
    relation: surrounded_by
    object: white_pixels #in the input
    
  - subject: expanded area
    relation: bounded
    object: constraint

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Isolated Green Pixels:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the input grid that are not directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any other green pixels.

2.  **Horizontal and Vertical Expansion**: For each isolated green pixel:
    *   Extend a line of green pixels horizontally to the left until a non-white pixel is hit or the edge of the grid.
    *   Extend a line of green pixels horizontally to the right until a non-white pixel is hit or the edge of the grid.
    *   Extend a line of green pixels vertically upward until a non-white pixel is hit or the edge of the grid.
    *   Extend a line of green pixels vertically downward until a non-white pixel is hit or the edge of the grid.

3. **Final output:** green pixels created.

In summary, the transformation takes each isolated green pixel and creates lines of green pixels until it can not.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
