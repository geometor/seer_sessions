facts:
  - object: background
    color: white (0)
    role: static, fills empty space
  - object: red_pixels
    color: red (2)
    input_state: scattered, isolated
    output_state: connected, forming nested squares
  - transformation: dilation_and_connection
    description: Red pixels expand and connect to form nested square structures.
  - spatial_relationship: input_to_output
    description:  The positions of the initial red pixels in the input influence, but do not directly correspond to, the positions of red pixels in the output.  The output's structure is a global transformation, not a local one.
