      rule: "If a blue pixel is between two non-white, non-blue pixels, change the blue pixel to match the color of adjacent non-white and non-blue."
      correct: false
    vertical_expansion:
      rule: "If a vertical_strip with color 8 is found, fill its whole column with color 8, if it is not blocked."
      correct: partially #only expands between min and max columns.

      correct: false
    vertical_expansion:
      rule: "If a vertical_strip with color 9 or 8 is found, fill its whole column with respective color, if it is not blocked."
      correct: false

      correct: false
    vertical_expansion:
      rule: "If a vertical_strip with certain colors is found, fill its whole column with respective color, if it is not blocked."
      correct: false
general_observations:
  - "Shapes are consistently altered to create vertically extended strips."
  - "Horizontal filling is context-dependent and incomplete."
  - "Vertical expansion logic is consistently misapplied in all given examples."
