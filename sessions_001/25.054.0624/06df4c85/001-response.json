The primary colors observed are:\n\n*   **0 (White):** Background color, often surrounding other colored areas.\n*   **8 (Azure):** Forms a consistent, repeating background pattern.\n*   **2 (Red), 1 (Blue), 3 (Green):** These colors appear in 2x2 blocks within the azure background.\n\nThe transformation seems to involve manipulating the non-azure colored blocks (2x2 blocks).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

That is three copies of red block should be present.\n   * If the x-coordinate for the top-left pixel is 15 (for 2x2 red blocks), no extra copy is required.\n    * If the block's color is 1 (blue) or 3(green), duplicate it at x-coordinates such to get two copies.\n\n4.  **Maintain Background:** The azure (8) background pattern and any white (0) regions outside the copied blocks remain unchanged. The duplication does not effect other color blocks.\n"
