Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are identical in size (23x23).
*   The grids consist of pixels with values ranging from 0 to 9, representing different colors.
*   There are repeating patterns of '0 0 1' in many rows, and solid rows of '1's.
*   There are distinct colored objects (red '2', yellow '4', maroon '9', azure '8') within the '0 0 1' patterns.
*   The colored objects in the output appear to be modifications or expansions of the colored objects in the input. Some seem to have changed the value of adjacent '1's.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 23
      columns: 23
      values: [0-9]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
        4: yellow
        8: azure
        9: maroon
  - type: object
    properties:
        colors: [red, yellow, maroon, azure]
        shape: Adjacent pixels of same color

actions:
    - type: modify
      description: Changing a blue pixel to match a neighboring color.
      conditions:
        - adjacency: The pixel is directly adjacent to a colored object.
    - type: expand
      description: expanding the color along the rows.

relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels can be horizontally, or vertically adjacent.
  - containment: Colored objects are contained within the grid.
  - modification: color '1' (blue) changes color adjacent to colored objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Colored Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with colors other than white (0) and blue (1). These are the initial "colored objects" (red, yellow, maroon, and azure).

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
    *   If a pixel is blue (1) and is horizontally adjacent to the *same* colored object on *both* its left and right, change the blue pixel's color to match that of the object.
    * if a blue pixel has different colored objects to its left and right, then maintain its color

3.  **Iterate through colored objects:**
    * For the objects with the colors, maroon(9) and azure(8), expand the objects within their respective vertical sections in the entire column if there is an azure object.

4. **No vertical consideration:** The color propagation/modification of the blue pixel happens only horizontally within a row.

In summary, the transformation involves expanding colored objects horizontally by converting adjacent blue pixels, only if the blue pixel has neighbors of the *same* color on either side in that row.
For the maroon(9) and azure (8), there are sections where all the blue(1) has been changed to maroon or azure, if it's between two instances of maroon or azure respectively.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
