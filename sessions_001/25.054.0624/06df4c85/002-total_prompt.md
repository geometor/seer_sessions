Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value from 0 to 9. The primary colors observed are:

*   **0 (White):** Background color, often surrounding other colored areas.
*   **8 (Azure):** Forms a consistent, repeating background pattern.
*   **2 (Red), 1 (Blue), 3 (Green):** These colors appear in 2x2 blocks within the azure background.

The transformation seems to involve manipulating the non-azure colored blocks (2x2 blocks).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 20
      - height: 20
      - cell_values: [0-9]
  - type: block
    description: 2x2 square of pixels
    properties:
      - colors: [1, 2, 3]
      - size: 2x2
      - position: variable

actions:
    - type: repeat
      description: copies a block of pixels
      parameters:
        - source: block of pixels
        - destination: location in grid

relationships:
  - type: background
    description: azure (8) pixels form the background and structure for other objects
  - type: contained_in
    description: the 2x2 color blocks (red, blue, green) are surrounded by azure pixels

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all 2x2 blocks of uniform color within the input grid, excluding those of color 8 (azure).

2.  **Conditional Replication:** For each identified 2x2 block, check its horizontal position (x-coordinate of its top-left pixel).

3. **Horizontal Expansion:**
   * If the x-coordinate for the top-left pixel is 3 or 9 (for 2x2 red blocks), duplicate the 2x2 block of red pixels, to the x coordinates 6, 12. That is three copies of red block should be present.
   * If the x-coordinate for the top-left pixel is 15 (for 2x2 red blocks), no extra copy is required.
    * If the block's color is 1 (blue) or 3(green), duplicate it at x-coordinates such to get two copies.

4.  **Maintain Background:** The azure (8) background pattern and any white (0) regions outside the copied blocks remain unchanged. The duplication does not effect other color blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
