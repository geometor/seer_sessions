The output grid seems to highlight certain areas of the input grid with green and adds red inside the azure objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Change the color of these interior pixels to red (2).\n\n3.  **Change Background**: Replace the white background with green(3)\n\nIn summary: The transformation involves identifying azure shapes, filling their interiors with red, and changing the white background to green.\n"
