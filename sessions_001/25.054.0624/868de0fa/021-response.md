Okay, here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The current code struggles with multiple blue regions and correctly placing the 2x2 red square within them. It seems to have issues with:

1.  **Inconsistent Red Square Placement:** The red square isn't always centered within the upper blue regions, and sometimes it overwrites parts of the input incorrectly.
2.  **Incorrect Region Selection for Orange Filling:** The orange filling logic needs to better accommodate edge cases with partial borders.
3.  **Overlapping regions:** The code isn't performant with overlapping areas.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Improving Region Identification:** Refine the `find_regions` function or its usage to handle overlapping or adjacent regions more robustly.
2.  **Precise Red Square Logic:** Modify the red square placement to be relative to each individual blue region's bounding box, ensuring it's centered and doesn't extend beyond the region's boundaries.
3.  **Refine Border Exclusion:** Ensure the orange fill is correctly excluding border in cases where the object extends to the edge of the image.

**Example Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on the discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   The red square is placed at the top-left corner instead of being centered within the top-left blue region.
    *   Orange fill in the bottom is correct.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   The red square should be in the top right region. The code creates orange squares in the top region
    *   The orange square isn't correctly centered within the remaining blue region.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Red squares appear, but misaligned, and orange squares are misaligned.
    *   The code has difficulty with the multiple non-contiguous blue regions.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   The red square placement is off-center in the upper blue region.
    *   Orange filling in the correct area

*   **Example 5:**
    *    Orange fill is in the incorrect region
    *   Red square in the top rectangle should be lower.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels in the input grid. Consider each region as a separate object.

2.  **Bottom-Most Region Processing:**
    *   Select the blue region with the lowest y-coordinate (bottom-most region).
    *   Fill the interior of this selected region with orange (7), excluding a one-pixel wide border around the region.

3.  **Other Regions Processing:**
    *   For all the *other* blue regions (all blue regions that are not the bottom most)
    *   Calculate the center coordinates (geometric center) of the region's bounding box.
    *   Place a 2x2 square of red (2) pixels centered at the calculated center coordinates. The placement should be entirely within the blue region; if the region is too small, skip red square placement for that region.

4.  **Copy Unchanged:** Any pixels that are not part of the transformed blue regions (i.e. are white) will maintain their original value.
