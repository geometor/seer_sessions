The input grid primarily consists of 0s (white) and 1s (blue).  The output grid introduces new colors: 2 (red) and 7 (orange). The positions of the 0s (white) remain unchanged. The transformation seems to focus on the 1s (blue). It appears that connected regions of 1s are being identified, and some, but not all are changing color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
