A contiguous block is defined as a group of one or more blue pixels connected horizontally, vertically and/or diagonally.\n2. Recolor Large Blue Blocks: If a contiguous blue block consists of 3 or more blue pixels, change those pixel's colors to red (2).\n3. Recolor a Specific Pixel: If the blue pixel has the location (1,1), change its color to orange(7).\n4. Preserve Other Pixels: All other pixels retain their original colors. Specifically, isolated blue pixels (those not part of a larger contiguous block) and white pixels remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_blocks(grid, color):\n    visited = set()\n    blocks = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_block):\n        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= col < grid.shape[1]) or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        current_block.append((row, col))\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(row + dr, col + dc, current_block)\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[row, col] == color and (row, col) not in visited:\n                current_block = []\n                dfs(row, col, current_block)\n                blocks.append(current_block)\n    return blocks\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    blue_blocks = find_contiguous_blocks(input_grid, 1)\n\n    for block in blue_blocks:\n      if len(block) >= 3:\n        for row, col in block:\n          output_grid[row, col] = 2\n      elif len(block) >0:\n          row, col = block[0]\n          if row == 1 and col == 1:\n              output_grid[row,col] = 7\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
