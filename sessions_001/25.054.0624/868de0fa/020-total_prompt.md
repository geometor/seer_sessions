Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), red (2) and orange (7). The input grid seems to contain distinct blue (1) and white(0) regions, while the output grid introduces new colors like red(2) and orange(7) within or replacing those regions. The transformation seems to involve identifying certain colored regions and either changing their color or filling sub-regions within them with a different color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - regions:
        - color: blue (1)
          shape: irregular, connected
        - color: white (0)
          shape: irregular, background
  - name: Output Grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - regions:
        - color: blue (1)
          shape: Similar but potentially modified from input
        - color: orange(7)
          shape: occupies a vertical subregion of input's blue(1)
        - color: white (0)
        - color: red (2)
          shape: occupies a subregion of input's blue(1)
actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: region
    parameters:
      - original_color: blue (1)
        new_color: orange (7)
        condition: "A large vertical part of the blue region"
      - original_color: blue (1)
        new_color: red(2)
        condition: "A small rectangular subregion in the center."
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The orange and red regions are fully contained within the original blue regions of the Input Grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Bottom transformation:** The bottom-most blue region is selected. Within this select region replace the blue color with orange except the border.
3.  **Center transformation:** Within the central large blue region in the top, a subregion, which is a rectangle of 2x2 and colored with red.
4. **Copy Unchanged:** All pixels that are not part of the identified blue regions (i.e., the white pixels) are copied unchanged from the input to the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
