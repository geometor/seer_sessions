The input grid appears to be primarily composed of white (0) and blue (1) pixels, while the output grid introduces red (2) and orange (7) pixels, seemingly based on the arrangement of the blue pixels in the input. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

A contiguous block is defined as a group of one or more blue pixels connected horizontally, vertically and/or diagonally.\n\n2.  **Recolor Large Blue Blocks:** If a contiguous blue block consists of 3 or more blue pixels, change those pixel's colors to red (2).\n\n3. **Recolor a Specific Pixel** If the blue pixel has the location (1,1), change its color to orange(7).\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels retain their original colors. Specifically, isolated blue pixels (those not part of a larger contiguous block) and white pixels remain unchanged.\n"
