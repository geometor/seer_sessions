  - object: blue_block
    description: Contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels.
    properties:
      top_row_block: True if any part of the block is in the first two rows (0 and 1), otherwise False.
      size: The number of pixels in the block.
    actions:
      - if: top_row_block is True
        then: |
          Check for "skipped" blue pixels.  A skipped blue pixel is one where there's a blue pixel
          to the left or right (but not diagonally) with exactly one pixel of any color in between within
          the top two rows.  If a skipped pixel exists, change the in-between pixel to orange (7).
      - if: top_row_block is False and size >= 3
        then: Change all pixels in the block to red (2).
      - if: starts in coordinate (1,1)
        then: Set the (1,1) color to orange.
  - object: white_pixel
