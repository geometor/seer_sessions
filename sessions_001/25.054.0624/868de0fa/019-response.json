The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), red (2) and orange (7). The input grid seems to contain distinct blue (1) and white(0) regions, while the output grid introduces new colors like red(2) and orange(7) within or replacing those regions. The transformation seems to involve identifying certain colored regions and either changing their color or filling sub-regions within them with a different color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
