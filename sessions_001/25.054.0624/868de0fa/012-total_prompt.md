"""
1.  **Identify Blue Blocks:** Examine the input grid. Identify all contiguous blocks of blue (1) pixels. A contiguous block consists of one or more blue pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
2.  **Categorize Blocks:** Determine if each blue block is a "top-row block." A block is a "top-row block" if *any* of its pixels are located in row 0 or row 1 of the grid.
3.  **Transform Top-Row Blocks:**
    *   If the top-row block starts at row 1, column 1 and the second element is 1, set the color of (1,1) to orange (7). Check the next two down and one to the right, and two to the right. Set these to orange as well if they exist.
    *  Scan the top two rows. For every blue pixel that is part of a top-row block, trace to see if other blue pixels are connected, within the top two rows, by skipping a cell. Replace all skipped cells with orange (7).
    *   If a contiguous block of blue pixels with 3 or more pixels *only* exists in the top two rows, and is not transformed to orange by skipping, do not transform it.
4.  **Transform Other Blocks:** For blue blocks that are *not* top-row blocks:
    *   If a block has 3 or more pixels, change all pixels in that block to red (2).
5.  **Preserve White Pixels:** White (0) pixels always remain unchanged.

Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code has several issues. It correctly identifies contiguous blue blocks and distinguishes between "top-row blocks" and others. However, the transformation logic is flawed, especially the "skip transform" and the special case handling at (1,1). The transformation of non-top-row blocks also needs refinement. The strategy is to:

1.  **Refine Top-Row Transformation:** Simplify and correct the logic for transforming blue blocks in the top two rows. Focus on the "skipping" behavior and ensure it's applied correctly and consistently.
2.  **Improve Non-Top-Row Transformation:** Ensure that blue blocks outside the top two rows are correctly transformed to red based on their size.
3.  **Address Edge Cases:** The current implementation performs poorly. Consider a general rule about transforming.
4.  **Iterative Testing:** After each modification, re-evaluate against all training examples.
5.  **Simplify logic:** Focus on clear action surrounding the blue objects.

**Metrics and Observations**
*   All outputs are the correct size.
*   All outputs use the expected color palette [0,1,2,7].
*   Pixel counts do not match expected.

Here's a breakdown of observations and the proposed logic in the YAML and natural language program:

```yaml
observations:
  - object: blue_block
    description: Contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels.
    properties:
      top_row_block: True if any part of the block is in the first two rows (0 and 1), otherwise False.
      size: The number of pixels in the block.
    actions:
      - if: top_row_block is True
        then: |
          Check for "skipped" blue pixels.  A skipped blue pixel is one where there's a blue pixel
          to the left or right (but not diagonally) with exactly one pixel of any color in between within
          the top two rows.  If a skipped pixel exists, change the in-between pixel to orange (7).
      - if: top_row_block is False and size >= 3
        then: Change all pixels in the block to red (2).
      - if: starts in coordinate (1,1)
        then: Set the (1,1) color to orange.
  - object: white_pixel
    description: Pixels with color white (0).
    properties: {}
    actions:
      - Remain unchanged.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Blocks:** Find all contiguous groups of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Top-Row Blocks (Rows 0 and 1):**
    *   Iterate through the first two rows (row indices 0 and 1).
    *   For each blue pixel, check for "skipped" blue pixels horizontally. A "skipped" blue pixel is defined as another blue pixel two positions away (either left or right) with one pixel (of any color) between them, all within the top two rows.
    *   If a "skipped" blue pixel is found, change the color of the pixel in between to orange (7).
3. **Check position (1,1):**
    * If pixel at (1,1) is blue set it to orange.
4.  **Other Blue Blocks:**
    *   For blue blocks *not* entirely within the top two rows: If a block contains 3 or more pixels, change all pixels within that block to red (2).
5.  **White Pixels:** White (0) pixels always remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
