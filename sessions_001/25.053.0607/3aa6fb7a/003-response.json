There are two azure objects in each example, and a slightly different process for each.\n\n3.  **First azure object**: Examine the object, if it is at least 2 pixels tall, add one blue pixel immediately to the right of the second azure pixel from the top.\n\n4.  **Second azure object**: Examine the object and if it is a \"mirrored L\" shape (two pixels high, and two pixels wide in a mirrored-L configuration), add one blue pixel in the corner of it.\n\n**Summary**\nThe transformation identifies specific azure-colored shapes and adds a blue pixel adjacent to each one, using a slightly different rule for each.\n"
