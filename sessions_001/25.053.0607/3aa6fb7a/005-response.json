These are our target objects.\n\n2.  **Classify objects:** Find a vertical line object and a reversed L object.\n\n3. **Process First Object (Vertical line):**\n    *   If one exists, get the second pixel (from the top)\n    *    Add a blue pixel to the immediate right.\n\n4. **Process Second Object (reversed L):**\n    *   If it exists, get the first pixel (top-left)\n    *   Add a blue pixel one position down.\n\n5.  **Output:** The output grid is the input grid with the added blue pixels inside the azure objects.\n"
