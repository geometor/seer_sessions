Object 1 is in the top-left, and Object 2 is in the bottom-right, rotated by 180 degrees.\n\n2.  **Detect Change**: New objects with color 1 are generated.\n\n3.  **Analyze Position**: Object 3 which is of color 1 can be placed in the empty slot of the first object. The empty slot of the second object is filled with the second object of color 1.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rule:** The input grid has two azure (color 8) L-shaped objects. Add a blue (color 1) pixel to fill the empty corner of each L-shape, thus forming 2x2 squares.\n\n"
