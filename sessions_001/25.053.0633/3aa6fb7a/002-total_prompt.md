Okay, let's analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation.

Here's a breakdown of my observations and the deduced transformation rule:


```yaml
observations:
  - grid_size: 7x7
  - input_colors:
    - 0: white
    - 8: azure
  - output_colors:
    - 0: white
    - 1: blue
    - 8: azure
  - object_types:
    - azure_shapes: Two separate L-shaped objects, one in the top-left and another in the bottom-right.
  - changes:
      - One azure pixel in each of the L shapes becomes blue.
      - The azure to blue change is always the pixel that is "inside" the "L" shape or "adjacent to the vertical and horizontal lines of the L"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all connected azure (8) shapes in the input grid. In this case identify "L" shaped azure objects.
2.  **Locate Inner Pixel**: Find, in each L shape, the azure pixel where a vertical and horizontal azure pixel neighbor it.
3.  **Change color**: Change the color of identified pixel to blue (1).
4. **Preserve other pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid retain the same color.

In summary, the transformation identifies "L"-shaped azure colored objects, and changes
the "inside" pixel from azure to blue while all other pixels remain the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
