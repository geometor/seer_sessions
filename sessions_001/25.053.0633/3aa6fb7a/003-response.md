Okay, I'm in the dreamer role now. Let's analyze the provided examples and my previous attempt's failures to understand the transformation rule.

The previous code was based on the idea of identifying "L"-shaped azure objects and changing an "inside" pixel to blue.  However, the implementation was flawed, and it didn't correctly identify the "inside" pixel in all cases. The code was too literal about finding an "L" defined as 2x2 block with missing corner. The code was not general enough.

Here's a refined observation of the transformation, focusing on the relationship between the input and expected output, and considering the failures of the previous code:

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8) pixels. These aren't necessarily "L" shaped. They are arbitrary shapes made of azure pixels.

2.  **Find Shared Borders:**  For each azure object, examine all the pixels immediately adjacent to it (up, down, left, right). Find positions that are "shared borders" among the azure pixels.

3. **Identify Inner Corner**: The inside pixel is the one with the most shared adjacent of the same color in an immediate horizontal/vertical direction.

4. **Change Pixel Color**: Change that identified "inside" pixel color from azure to blue (1). This only happens once per connected azure shape.

5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

The key difference from my previous attempt is recognizing that its any azure shapes and that we identify the single "most interior border" pixel on the azure shape and change its color. The last implementation had some hard coded relative position changes that would fail in all but a simple "L" shape.
