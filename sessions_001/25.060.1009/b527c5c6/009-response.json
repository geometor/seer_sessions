There are also a few isolated red (2) pixels within the green areas.\n*   The output grid seems to retain the overall shape of the green areas from the input.\n*   The red pixels in the input seem to influence changes in the output, sometimes expanding or shifting.\n* White areas remain white.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
