Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Copy the Grid:** Start with a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve White:** All white (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output.
3.  **Preserve Green regions**: Maintain green (3) in output, except adjacent to red.
4.  **Modify Red:**
    *   If a red pixel is next to existing green, it and all adjacent pixels become red in output.
    *   If a single red pixel exists in the input, the three pixels above are converted to `3 2 3` respectively.
    *   If there are adjacent reds in a line, replace those with a solid red line.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code captures some aspects of the transformation, particularly the handling of white pixels and some of the red pixel transformations. However, it's clear from the test results that the logic concerning green and red pixel interactions, especially the conditions under which red pixels cause changes and how green is handled, needs improvement. Specifically, it's missing the "spread" or "fill" aspect where the red color extends. The current code is converting green to red if any red is a neighbor. It also does not handle cases of isolated red dots as a trigger.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output/predicted output triplet, focusing on discrepancies. We'll look for incorrect color changes, missed color changes, and extra color changes.
2.  **Object and Relationship Identification:** Identify all distinct objects (contiguous regions of the same color), their properties (color, shape, size), and their spatial relationships (adjacency).
3.  **Rule Refinement:** Iteratively adjust the natural language program and the corresponding code based on the error analysis. Focus on clarifying the conditions for red expansion and green preservation.
4.  **Verification**: Re-test after each adjustment until results align with all examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get accurate metrics, I'll simulate code execution and examine the arrays. Since I can't directly execute code here, I'll describe what I *would* do and the expected results.

*Example 1*

-   **Input:** A 3x3 grid with a single red pixel in the center.
-   **Output:** The top three pixels are `3 2 3`, and the original red pixel remains.
-   **Prediction:** Correct
-    Notes: This tests the single red case

*Example 2*

-   **Input:** Horizontal line of red with green on either side.
-   **Output:** Solid red line
-   **Prediction**: Correct
-   Notes: This confirms the green to red conversion for adjacent pixels

*Example 3*

-   **Input:** Red line with green to the right, two dots of isolated green
-   **Output:** Red line and red dot on right, isolated green remains unchanged
-   **Prediction**: Incorrect, right green dot removed
-   Notes: Introduces isolated pixel handling, requires changes in program.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel_group
    color: red
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - can_expand
  - type: pixel_group
    color: green
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - can_be_converted_to_red_if_adjacent
  - type: pixel_group
    color: white
    properties:
      - background
      - static
actions:
  - name: expand_red
    condition: red_adjacent_to_green
    result: convert_green_to_red
  - name: create_pattern_323
    condition: single_red_pixel
    result: set_three_pixels_above
  - name: preserve_color
    condition:
      - white_pixel
      - nonadjacent_green_pixel # green and not next to red
    result: no_change

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Copy Grid:** Create a copy of the input grid as the output grid.
2.  **Preserve White:** White pixels in the input remain white in the output (this is implicit in the copy).
3.  **Single Red Pixel Rule:** If there's a *single* red pixel (not adjacent to other red pixels), change the three pixels directly above it to the pattern `3 2 3` (green, red, green), *if those three pixels exist*.
4. **Green to Red Conversion:** Convert any green pixel to a red pixel if it has any neighboring red pixel.
5.  **Preserve Non-adjacent Green:** If a green is NOT adjacent to any red, it does not change.

The key improvement is the precise definition and ordering. The initial rule for adjacency needed refined to indicate what is adjacent to what.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
