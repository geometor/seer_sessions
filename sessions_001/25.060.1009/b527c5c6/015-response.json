The height is determined by the position of the other red pixel.\n5. **Paint Red:** Create a red horizontal bar in the location of the moved lower red pixel.\n\nThe program takes an input grid, identifies green regions and any red pixels inside the regions, and repositions the red regions in the rows based on the initial position of the red pixels.\n"
