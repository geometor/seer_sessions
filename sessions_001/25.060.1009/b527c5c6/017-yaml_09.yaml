- transformation_rule: |
    1. Identify all connected green regions.
    2. Within each green region, locate any red pixels.
    3. Expand the green region upwards, filling all pixels with green, starting from the column bounds of the region and up to the row containing the (first encountered) red pixel.  If multiple red pixels exist in a region, only the top-most one seems to matter, the expansion stops at the first red pixel.
    4. Keep all the existing elements of the input grid that was not overwritten by step 3.
