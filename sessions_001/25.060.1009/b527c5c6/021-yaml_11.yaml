objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 20x20
      - colors: [0, 2, 3]
    regions:
      - color: 3
        description: large block in the top-left
      - color: 0
        description: background, mostly lower and right side
      - color: 2
        description: isolated pixels within the green and white areas

  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 20x20
      - colors: [0, 2, 3]
    regions:
      - color: 3
        description: similar shape to input, but some extension downward
      - color: 0
        description: reduced area compared to input
      - color: 2
        description: vertical line on the left, extended horizontal block replacing the input's isolated pixel
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rules:
      - the green (3) extends vertically down to include the area previously occupied by isolated red cell, keeping its left position unchanged
      - the red isolated cell (2) near the bottom becomes a horizontal extension of red pixels, and appears to move upwards 1 line
      - the red isolated cell in the top, left of center, creates a vertical red line from top to bottom, keeping its x position
