The input grids appear to have a vertical and a horizontal line of single color crossing each other, against a background that is mostly filled with 0. The position of vertical and horizontal lines shifts between examples. The transformation seems to alter cells where the horizontal line intersects the vertical line.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
