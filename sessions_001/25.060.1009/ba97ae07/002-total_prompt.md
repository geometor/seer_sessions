**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. The input grids appear to have a vertical and a horizontal line of single color crossing each other, against a background that is mostly filled with 0. The position of vertical and horizontal lines shifts between examples. The transformation seems to alter cells where the horizontal line intersects the vertical line.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - name: vertical_line
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: integer (non-zero)
      - position: column index
      - length: extends to grid height
  - name: horizontal_line
    type: object
    properties:
     - color: integer (non-zero)
     - position: row index
     - length: extends to grid width
  - name: background
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: integer (0)
      - shape: fills the remaining grid

actions:
    - name: intersect
      input: [vertical_line, horizontal_line]
      description: Finds overlapping/common cells.
    - name: replace_color
      input: [grid, intersect output, vertical color]
      description: overwrites value in target cell, using the color of the vertical line.
      
relationships:
  - type: intersection
    between: [vertical_line, horizontal_line]
    result: set of cells
  - type: background
    between: [background, vertical_line]
  - type: background
    between: [background, horizontal_line]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the vertical and horizontal lines within the input grid. A line is defined as a continuous set of cells of the same non-zero color, extending either across an entire row (horizontal) or down an entire column (vertical). The background consists of 0.

2.  **Find Intersection:** Determine the cell where the vertical and horizontal lines intersect. This is the cell that shares the same row index as the horizontal line and same column index of the vertical line.

3. **Apply transformation:** Within the horizontal line, replace the color of the intersection pixel by the vertical line color.

4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
