The input grids seem to have repeating patterns of colored squares, with the color '0' (white) acting as a background. The output appears to be a list of the unique colors present in the input, but ordered in a way which I have to determine. The colors in the output stack vertically.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
