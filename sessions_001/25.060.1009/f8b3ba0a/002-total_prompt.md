**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a sequence of single digits. The input grids seem to have repeating patterns of colored squares, with the color '0' (white) acting as a background. The output appears to be a list of the unique colors present in the input, but ordered in a way which I have to determine. The colors in the output stack vertically.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9] # Representing different colors.
      - shape: variable (rows x columns)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    description: Ordered sequence of digits representing colors.
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - length: variable

actions:
  - name: identify_unique_colors
    description: Find all the unique colors present in the input grid (excluding 0).
  - name: order_colors
    description: Determine a consistent rule for the color order.
    
relationships:
   - input_grid colors map to output_sequence elements.
   - the output_sequence has an order of colors.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Unique Colors:** Scan the input grid and identify all unique colors present, ignoring the background color '0'.

2. **Order Colors:** Order the unique colors in a consistent manner. Examining the examples, the order is determined based on the color that is present in the **top most, then left most unique color objects** in the input grid.

3.  **Output Sequence:** Create a list (sequence) of the ordered colors, represent the list a vertical stacked grid, each cell containing a unique color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
