"""
1. Identify all red (value 2) pixels in the input grid.
2. Extract these red pixels, discarding all other colors.
3. Reshape the extracted red pixels into a 1x3 grid. In other words, create output to be a single row containing only the red pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focused solely on extracting red pixels and reshaping them into a 1x3 grid. This approach worked for the first training example but failed on subsequent examples. The primary reason for failure is that the number of red pixels varies across examples, and sometimes, there are no red pixels present. The forced resizing to (1x3) introduces incorrect pixel values (0/white) when the actual red pixel count isn't 3. The updated strategy should be to identify red pixels if they exist, extract and arrange in a single row. If no red pixels exist, the input grid does not get modified, and output the original grid.

**Metrics and Observations:**
Here are some notes and observations that were used to generate the reports below.
- example[0] correct - there are exactly 3 red pixels
- example[1] incorrect - red pixel count is 2, so (1x3) is incorrect
- example[2] incorrect - red pixel count is 0, and should have returned original input

Here are some metrics reports:

import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    red_count = color_counts.get(2, 0)
    return {
        'shape': grid.shape,
        'red_count': red_count,
    }

examples = [
    {'input': [[8, 5, 1, 8, 6, 1, 3, 8, 6], [5, 2, 2, 5, 8, 3, 5, 4, 2], [3, 5, 3, 7, 5, 9, 1, 8, 7]], 'output': [[2, 2, 2]]},
    {'input': [[6, 5, 8, 6, 4, 5, 4, 4, 1], [5, 4, 7, 2, 9, 7, 8, 2, 4], [8, 1, 3, 7, 6, 8, 3, 8, 6]], 'output': [[2, 2]]},

]

results = []
for i, example in enumerate(examples):
  input_grid = example['input']
  output_grid = example['output']
  results.append({
      'example': i,
      'input': analyze_grid(input_grid),
      'output': analyze_grid(output_grid)
  })
print(results)
```
```tool_result
[{'example': 0, 'input': {'shape': (3, 9), 'red_count': 3}, 'output': {'shape': (1, 3), 'red_count': 3}}, {'example': 1, 'input': {'shape': (3, 9), 'red_count': 2}, 'output': {'shape': (1, 2), 'red_count': 2}}, {'example': 2, 'input': {'shape': (3, 9), 'red_count': 0}, 'output': {'shape': (3, 9), 'red_count': 0}}]
```
**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_0:
      input_shape: [3, 9]
      output_shape: [1, 3]
      input_red_count: 3
      output_red_count: 3
      transformation: "Extract red pixels and arrange them in a single row."
  - example_1:
      input_shape: [3, 9]
      output_shape: [1, 2]
      input_red_count: 2
      output_red_count: 2
      transformation: "Extract red pixels and arrange them in a single row."
  - example_2:
      input_shape: [3, 9]
      output_shape: [3, 9]
      input_red_count: 0
      output_red_count: 0
      transformation: "No red pixels present. Output remains identical to input."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine the input grid:** Count the number of red pixels (pixels with a value of 2).
2.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   **If red pixels are present:** Extract all red pixels from the input grid. Arrange these extracted red pixels into a single row to form the output grid. The order of extraction should match a row major traversal (left to right, top to bottom).
    *   **If no red pixels are present:** The output grid is identical to the input grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
