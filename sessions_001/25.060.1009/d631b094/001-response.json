The input grids are all 3x3, while the output grids vary in size but seem to be 1 row with a variable number of columns, with repeated colored pixels. The core operation appears to be identifying the non-zero digits in the input grid and creating a new grid containing only those non-zero colors, repeated a number of times dependent on how many occurrences there are in the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
