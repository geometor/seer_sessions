Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors observed are white (0), yellow (4), and red (2). The input grid seems to contain two distinct objects: a larger yellow structure and a smaller red square within it. The output grid maintains the yellow and red structures but introduces two new, isolated red pixels in the top right quadrant of the grid, while keeping other part the same as input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  yellow_structure:
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: irregular, resembling an arch or an open rectangle
    position: bottom-center of the grid
    size: occupies multiple cells
  red_square:
    color: red (2)
    shape: square
    position: inside the yellow structure, bottom-center
    size: 2x2
  new_red_pixels:
    color: red(2)
    shape: single pixels
    position: top right corner, relative to the upper bound of yellow structure

actions:
  - type: addition
    object: new_red_pixels
    location: top-right, with vertical and horizontal offsets from yellow structure.

relationships:
  - red_square is contained within yellow_structure
  - new_red_pixels are placed at a specific offset and outside of the original objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Existing Objects:** Locate the existing yellow (4) structure and the red (2) square within it.
2.  **Preserve:** Keep the yellow structure and red square to the output.
3.  **Determine New Pixel Locations:**
    *   Find the highest row (minimum y-coordinate) occupied by the yellow structure.
    *   Place the first new red pixel two row above the highest row of the yellow structure, and at the very beginning of that row (index 0).
    *   Place the second new red pixel two rows above the highest row of the yellow structure, and one row before the very last entry of that row.
4.  **Add New Pixels:** Create two new red (2) pixels at the calculated locations.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
