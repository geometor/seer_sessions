Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies the "topmost" and "leftmost" non-background colored pixel within the smallest bounding box that encloses all non-background pixels. 
It then duplicates or moves that pixel's color to a new "target region". 
The "target region" is the largest background-colored region (value 0) that is adjacent to any part of the boundary of any non-background colored region.
If multiple copies of the target color are required, they are added along the top or left boundaries of the new region.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
