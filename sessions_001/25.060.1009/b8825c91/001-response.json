The input and output grids have the same dimensions in all the provided examples. The transformation appears to be a local operation, potentially involving a pixel and its immediate neighbors, or a specific pattern replacement. A very noticeable change is replacement of certain colors, seemingly those enclosing 'holes'.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify all \"enclosed regions.\" An enclosed region is defined as a contiguous group of pixels of the same color, completely surrounded by a different, single color. Contiguous means 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right - not diagonal). The surrounding \"border\" pixels must all be of the same color.\n\n2.  **Replace Interior Color:** For each enclosed region, replace the color of the enclosed region's pixels with the color of the surrounding border pixels. If the border has more than 1 unique color the region is not changed.\n\n3. **Other pixels**: all other pixels keep original value.\n\nEssentially, the transformation \"fills in\" enclosed areas with the color of their surrounding border.\n"
