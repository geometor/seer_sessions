Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the need to recolor specific regions. However, the description "spatially determined, affecting regions that are towards the lower right corner of the grid" is too vague and doesn't accurately capture the rule. The code correctly recolors all instances of yellow (4) to green (3) and light blue (8) to maroon (9), regardless of their position. The provided examples and the successful execution on ALL training examples indicates that the spatial constraint is incorrect. The rule is a simple color replacement, which the generated function already does correctly.

**Strategy:**

1.  Since code execution was 100% successful, there is no need to change the generated function
2.  Update the natural language program and YAML description to reflect correct context

**Metrics and Observations:**

Since the code works, there is no need for metrics. I will simply describe the successful transformation in the natural program.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: d511f180
facts:
  objects:
    - description: input grid
      properties:
        colors: [0, 4, 8]
    - description: output grid
      properties:
        colors: [0, 3, 9]
  actions:
    - description: Recolor all pixels.
      details:
        - Change all yellow (4) pixels to green (3).
        - Change all light blue/azure (8) pixels to maroon (9).

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.**
2.  **Change the color of these pixels to green (3) in the output grid.**
3. **Identify all azure/light blue(8) pixels in the input grid.**
4. **Change the color of these pixels to maroon(9) in the output grid.**
5.  **All other pixels remain the same color.**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
