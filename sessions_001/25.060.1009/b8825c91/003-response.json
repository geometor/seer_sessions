Here's my report on the provided input-output pair:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe input and output are grids of the same dimensions (16x16). Each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. Visual inspection reveals large blocks of uniform color, suggesting objects. The primary difference between input and output appears to be a change in color in specific regions. In particular, the colors represented by '4' (yellow) in the center of the input grid appears to be replaced with '3'(green), the inner region with '8'(light blue) and finally the smallest interior area is transformed from '4'(yellow) again to '9' (dark red) in the lower right.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
