Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited observation (likely just the first example). It focused on replacing gray pixels with green pixels based on adjacent white pixels, particularly in a checkerboard-like pattern and has hard-coded behavior. It's clear from the additional examples and execution results that the original rule is too specific and incorrect in many cases. The function fails to correctly transform several inputs, particularly when all gray pixles bordered by white pixels on the top and bottom, and the first and last rows. It's overly reliant on a horizontal and vertical white pixel condition.

The core issue is that it's a partial pattern, not the underlying rule. The strategy for resolving errors will involve:

1.  **Broadening Observation:** Carefully examining *all* provided input/output pairs to identify the *consistent* rule. We cannot focus on a single feature (like horizontal/vertical neighbors) but must consider the overall context.
2.  **Identifying the Core Condition:** Determine the *precise* condition under which gray pixels become green.
3.  **Rejecting Premature Optimization:** The initial code jumped to a specific checkerboard pattern and horizontal/vertical neighbors too quickly. We must first find the general rule.
4.  **Refining the Natural Language Program:** Rewriting the program to be a clear, concise, and *complete* description of the transformation.
5. **Developing a robust function:** Rewrite the python code to match the new natural language program.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately analyze the errors, I need to see the *actual results* of running the `transform` function on *each* input grid, compared to the *expected* output grid. Since I cannot execute code directly, I will use this prompt to document my observation *about each example* using the limited information I have been provided. This section is crucial for identifying the true pattern.

Since I do not have the visual display or the result of the code, I will make notes based on the code provided:

*   **Example 1:** (Assumed successful based on initial code description). The first row transformation of gray to green is handled.

*   **Example 2:** The code, as described, will likely *fail* because it appears to *only* replace gray pixels with green pixels when the gray pixel in the first row has two vertical and two horizontal white neighbors. This condition is NOT met in this example.

*   **Example 3:** Similar to example 2, the code will likely *fail* because the gray pixels that should be transformed are not in the first row and/or do not have two white horizontal and vertical neighbors.

*   **Example 4:** Similar to examples 2 and 3, the code will likely *fail*.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain gray (5) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      The output grids contain green (3) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      Gray pixels are replaced by green pixels.
  - observation: |
     The transformation depends on the relative position of a gray pixel and all it's white neighbors
  - object: gray_pixel
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      adjacent_pixels: [up, down, left, right]
    actions:
      - replaced_with: green (3)
        condition: adjacent white pixels on top and bottom, or left and right, especially on the borders of the image.
  - object: white_pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    actions: []
  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable
    actions: []
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** gray pixels (value 5).
3.  For each gray pixel:
    *   Check for adjacent white pixels.
    *   If a gray pixel on the **first row** has adjacent white pixels **above and below**, replace it with a green pixel (value 3).
    *   If a gray pixel on the **last row** has adjacent white pixels **above and below**, replace it with a green pixel (value 3).
    *   If a gray pixel has adjacent white pixels on the **left and right**, replace it with a green pixel (value 3)

This revised program focuses on all white pixels adjacent to the gray ones. It removes the premature optimization around the checkerboard concept. It correctly prioritizes the location on the first and last row as important context.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
