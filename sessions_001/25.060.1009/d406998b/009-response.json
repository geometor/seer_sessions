The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x12). The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), gray (5), and green (3). The transformation appears to selectively change some gray (5) pixels to green (3), while other pixels remain unchanged. It's likely that a spatial pattern or rule dictates which gray pixels are changed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
