Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The input grid appears to have a pattern of gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The output grid introduces green (3) pixels, seemingly replacing some of the gray pixels based on a specific rule. The dimensions of the grid remain constant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: [0, 3, 5]  # Possible pixel values (colors)
      color: [white, green, gray]
      position: (row, col) # (x,y)

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: (3, 14)  # Rows, Columns
      cells: list of pixels

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    agent: system
    input: pixel (gray)
    output: pixel (green)
    condition: specific spatial rule (to be determined)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    between: pixels
    details: adjacency, pattern (alternating, checkerboard-like)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   Gray pixels on the top row are replaced by green if the gray colored pixel has two vertically or two horizontally adjacent white pixels.
    *    Gray pixels on the left and right edge should remain unchanged.
    *    Gray pixels along the bottom edge that has two horizontally adjacent white pixels get replaced with green ones.
    *    Gray pixels along the edge in the middle row should remain unchanged.
    * Other gray pixels remain unchanged

In simpler terms, select the gray pixels that are on the border of a 2x2 block, and replace only those that are not in the edge columns (columns 0 and 13) and edge rows, if they have two adjacent white pixels.
