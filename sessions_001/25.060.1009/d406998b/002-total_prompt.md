**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.  The dominant colors are white (0) and gray (5). The transformation seems to selectively replace some gray (5) pixels with green (3) pixels, while leaving others unchanged. The key is to discern the pattern or rule determining *which* gray pixels are changed. The overall grid dimensions remain constant between input and output. There aren't any obvious geometric transformations like rotations or reflections.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, cols] # Variable, but consistent within each example pair
      elements: pixels
      colors: [0, 5, 3] # white, gray, green

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: int # 0, 3, or 5
      position: [row_index, col_index]

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    parameters:
      old_color: 5
      new_color: 3
    conditions:
      # This is what we need to define in the natural language program
      positional_rule:  "Alternating columns, see natural language program"

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: "Pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically."
    - type: spatial
      description: "Pattern of replacement is spatially determined."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine each pixel in the input grid. Only gray (5) pixels are candidates for modification.

2.  **Column-Based Alternation (starting from the left edge of the grid):**
    *   Consider every other column starting with the *third* column containing at least one grey pixel. Let's call the first of these columns, `col_1`.
    *   Within `col_1`, and all subsequent columns at 3-column intervals to the *right* (`col_1 + 3`, `col_1 + 6`, ...), replace any gray (5) pixel with a green (3) pixel.
    *   Within `col_1`, and all subsequent columns at 3-column intervals to the *left* (`col_1 -3`, `col_1 - 6`, ...), replace any gray (5) pixel with a green (3) pixel.

3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not gray (5) in the designated alternating columns remain unchanged. All gray pixels in other columns, not defined above, remain unchanged.

In summary: the transformation replaces grey pixels with green, in alternating *columns* that contain grey, starting at the third column containing grey.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
