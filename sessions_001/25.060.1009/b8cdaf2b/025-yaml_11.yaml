observations:
  - example: 1
    input_yellow_pixels:  "[(7, 3), (7, 7)]"
    output_yellow_pixels: "[(4, 3), (5, 3), (4, 7), (5, 7)]"
    rule: "For each column containing a yellow pixel, two yellow pixels are added three and two rows above the highest row that contains a yellow."
    result: "Correct"

  - example: 2
    input_yellow_pixels:  "[(5, 4), (5, 5)]"
    output_yellow_pixels: "[(2, 4), (3, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5)]"
    rule: "For each column containing a yellow pixel, two yellow pixels are added three and two rows above the highest row that contains a yellow."
    result: "Incorrect"

  - example: 3
    input_yellow_pixels:  "[(2, 6), (2, 7)]`
    output_yellow_pixels: "[(8, 6), (7, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7)]"
    rule: "For each column containing a yellow pixel, two yellow pixels are added three and two rows below the lowest row that contains a yellow."
    result: "Incorrect"
