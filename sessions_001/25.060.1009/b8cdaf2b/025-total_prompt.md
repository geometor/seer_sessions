Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Bottom Object:** Find the horizontal line of red and yellow pixels at the bottom of the input grid (rows 6 and 7).

2.  **Place Yellow Pixels:**
     Locate columns in the red/yellow object where yellow pixels are present. For each located column, place a yellow pixel at row index `[height - 4]` and `[height-3]` , where `height` represents the height of the input grid.

3. Leave other pixels unchanged.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    height = input_grid.shape[0]

    # Find columns with yellow pixels in the bottom two rows
    for col in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
        if input_grid[height - 1, col] == 4:
            # Place yellow pixels
            output_grid[height - 4, col] = 4
            output_grid[height - 3, col] = 4

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
