The input grid contains zeros (white), eights (azure), and a single three (green). The output grid introduces threes (green) in a seemingly symmetrical pattern around the existing three, while keeping the original elements (8 and 3) in the bottom two rows unchanged. The zeros in the top 3 rows are locations that may change.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
