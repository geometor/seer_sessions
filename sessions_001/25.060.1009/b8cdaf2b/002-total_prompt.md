**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The input grids consistently transform into output grids of the same dimensions. The transformation isn't a simple global operation (like changing all instances of one color to another). It appears to be context-sensitive, meaning the change of a pixel depends on its neighbors or its position within the grid. The most visually prominent change is often the alteration of pixels near, but not part of, the bottom two rows.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - object: "Grid"
    properties:
      - "2D array of pixels"
      - "Each pixel has a color value (0-9)"
  - object: "Pixel"
    properties:
      - "Color value"
      - "Row index"
      - "Column index"
  - observation: "The bottom two rows of the grid remain unchanged in all examples"
  - observation: "Changes mostly occur above bottom two rows"
  - observation: "colors are replaced, added, or stay the same based on a pattern"
  - relationship:
      - "Pixels directly above colored pixels get replaced."
      - "if the row above those has a color, it might get the color from two rows below."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Grid:** Start with a copy of the input grid. This ensures that unchanged parts of the grid are preserved.

2.  **Preserve Bottom Two Rows:** Explicitly state that the bottom two rows of the input grid are directly copied to the output grid without modification.

3. **Iterate from third to last row, upwards** Iterate rows upwards starting from the third-to-last row.

4.  **Conditional Color Change:** For each pixel above the bottom two rows, going upwards.

        a. If it is a '0' (white)
        b. Check, two rows below, and get the color.

5.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output.

In simpler terms, the core logic seems to be: "The bottom two rows are copied. Go upwards from there. If we find color `x`, look up two rows. If the color is `0`, put an `x` there.".

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
