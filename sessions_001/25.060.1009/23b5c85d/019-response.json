This approach worked for the first training example but failed on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't solely about magenta pixels. We need to generalize the rule to account for other colors and potentially other spatial relationships or object properties. The other examples suggest that some specific shape with a unique color defines a subgrid region.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples**: Not just the magenta one. Look for patterns. Identify the 'key' object, its properties, which determine the subgrid extraction.\n2.  **Generalize**: Update the natural language program to reflect a more general rule, not specific to just magenta.\n3.  **Code Execution**: Use the environment's capabilities to get exact data.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**\n\n```tool_code\ntask.present_examples(include_test=False)\n```"
