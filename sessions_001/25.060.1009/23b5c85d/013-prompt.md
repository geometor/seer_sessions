Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid to identify all distinct rectangular objects. A rectangular object is a contiguous block of pixels with the same color. Record the color, dimensions (height and width), and position of each object.
2.  **Find Blue Objects:** Among all identified objects, find all objects that are blue (color value 1).
3.  **Determine Largest Blue Object:** If blue objects exist, determine the *largest* blue object. The size of an object is determined by the product of its height and width (number of pixels).
4. **Determine output dimension:** The size of the output must be the same of the largest blue object.
5.  **Create Output:** Create an output grid filled entirely with blue color (value 1) with the dimensions of the largest blue object. If no blue objects are found, no output is created.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
