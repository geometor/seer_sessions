Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels. There are distinct rectangular regions of blue (1), magenta (6), and yellow (4). The output is a much smaller grid containing only the yellow (4) pixels. It appears the task involves extracting a specific colored region.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: blue
    id: blue_rect
  - type: rectangle
    color: magenta
    id: magenta_rect
  - type: rectangle
    color: yellow
    id: yellow_rect
  - type: grid
    id: input_grid
  - type: grid
    id: output_grid

properties:
  - object: blue_rect
    attribute: position
    value: (top-middle)
  - object: magenta_rect
    attribute: position
    value: (bottom-middle)
  - object: yellow_rect
    attribute: position
    value: (embedded within blue_rect, right side)
  - object: input_grid
    attribute: dimensions
    value: (18 x 15)
  - object: output_grid
    attribute: dimensions
    value: (2 x 2)
  - object: yellow_rect
     attribute: dimensions
     value: (2x2)

actions:
  - type: extraction
    agent: SEER
    target: yellow_rect
    source: input_grid
    destination: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: contains
    subject: input_grid
    object: blue_rect
  - type: contains
    subject: input_grid
    object: magenta_rect
  - type: contains
    subject: input_grid
    object: yellow_rect
  - type: spatial
    relation: "within"
    subject: yellow_rect
    object: blue_rect

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the rectangular region of yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract** this yellow region.
3.  **Output** the extracted yellow region as a new grid.

In essence, the transformation rule is to isolate and output the yellow sub-grid.
