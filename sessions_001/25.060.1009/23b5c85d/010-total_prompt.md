Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 20x20 grid containing multiple colored rectangular objects. The output is a 3x3 grid containing only the color blue (represented by the digit 1). The input grid includes rectangles of green (3), yellow (4), red (2), azure (8) and blue (1). The blue rectangle in the input is located near the lower right corner and has the size 3 x 2 pixels. The position and dimension is related to the dimension of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: green
    position: (3, 1) # top-left corner coordinates
    dimensions: (7, 9)
  - type: rectangle
    color: yellow
    position: (3, 10)
    dimensions: (4, 6)
  - type: rectangle
    color: red
    position: (10, 4)
    dimensions: (5, 6)
  - type: rectangle
    color: azure
    position: (2, 12)
    dimensions: (6, 7)
  - type: rectangle
    color: blue
    position: (15, 14)
    dimensions: (2, 3)
  - type: background
    color: white

output:
  dimensions: (3x3)
  content: all blue (1)

relationships:
    - output_size_matches_input_object: blue rectangle

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct rectangular objects based on contiguous blocks of the same color. Note color, size, and location.

2.  **Locate the target object:** Locate the blue colored object that is positioned at bottom right area of the input.

3. **Determine output size**: The size of the output grid is identical to the dimensions of the blue object in the input, but transposed, such as the blue rectangle is 2 by 3, and output 3 by 2.

4.  **Create Output:** Create an output grid of the determined size (from step 3), filled entirely with blue color (value 1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
