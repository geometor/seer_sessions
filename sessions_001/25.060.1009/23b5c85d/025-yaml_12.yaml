facts:
  - observation: "Each input grid contains a single contiguous block of a non-zero color."
  - observation: "The output grid always contains only the non-zero colored block from the input grid."
  - observation: "The background (color 0) is always removed."
  - observation: "The shape of the output grid matches the bounding box of the non-zero colored object in the input grid."
  - observation: "The position of the non-zero colored object in the input grid does not affect its position in the output grid (it's always top-left aligned)."
