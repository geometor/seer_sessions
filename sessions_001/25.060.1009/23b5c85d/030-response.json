            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies and extracts the yellow (color 4) object in the input grid. The provided code works perfectly for all three examples. The initial natural language program was already accurate and comprehensive. We will re-state it and add observations.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using the provided code, no changes needed for gathering metrics)**\n\nThe code execution results already provide the necessary metrics:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Match: True\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Match: True\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (2, 5)\n    *   Actual Output Shape: (2, 5)\n    *   Match: True\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - context: |\n      The input grid contains a single object of interest, defined by the color yellow (4). The rest of the grid is filled with the background color (0, white).\n  - objects:\n    - name: yellow_object\n      color: 4\n      description: |\n        A contiguous region of pixels with color value 4.  The shape of this region varies.\n    - name: background\n      color: 0\n      description:  The background that surrounds the object of interest.\n  - actions:\n    - name: extract_object\n      description: |\n          The yellow object is identified, and a new grid is created containing only the pixels within the bounding box of that object. The output grid's dimensions match the extent of the yellow object.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find the contiguous region of pixels colored yellow (4) within the input grid.  This forms the object of interest.\n2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Calculate the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the yellow object. This defines a rectangular bounding box around the object.\n3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new output grid by extracting the portion of the input grid that falls within the bounding box. This new grid contains only the yellow object, with no surrounding background pixels.\n4. Return the extracted grid.\n\n"
