Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: a larger region of red (2) pixels enclosing a smaller square region of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid consists entirely of azure (8) pixels, matching the color and shape of the inner region in the input. The surrounding red and white regions are completely removed. The transformation seems to focus on extracting a specific sub-region.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        position: border
      - color: red
        value: 2
        position: encloses_azure_region
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        position: inner_square
        dimensions: 3x3

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        position: fills_grid

  - action: extract_region
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Extracts the inner azure square region from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target region:** Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) colored pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine dimensions:** Find the dimensions of this azure block (in this case, 3x3).
3.  **Extract:** Create a new grid with the dimensions of the azure block.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill the new grid entirely with azure (8) pixels. Essentially, the output grid is a copy of the azure region.
5. Remove all other colours and not connected to the azure object.

In essence, the program isolates and extracts the inner azure square from the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
