            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and the training examples to refine the natural language program and the code's approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code focused on finding the smallest azure square and extracting it. This worked for the first training example, but it fails for the second training sample as there is no azure square. The key is to revise the program to deal with inputs that does not contains any azure square.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of the expected output with the code's output:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 6x6 grid with an azure square (2x2) and other colored pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 azure square.\n    *   Code Output: 2x2 azure square.\n    *   Result: Success. The code correctly identified and extracted the smallest azure square.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid with a mix of colors, but no azure colored pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: 3x3 red square.\n    *   Code Output: An empty array.\n    *   Result: Failure. The code couldn't find any azure square and return an empty grid, not a 3x3 red square as expected.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *  Input: 11x6 grid, with no azure squares.\n    *  Expected output: 3x3 green sqaure\n    *  Code output: \\[\\[]]\n    *  Result: Failure. Expects a 3x3 green square.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: \"The code's logic is based on finding and extracting the *smallest* azure square.\"\n  - input_grid_1: \"Contains a 2x2 azure square.\"\n  - output_grid_1: \"Is the 2x2 azure square from the input.\"\n  - input_grid_2: \"Does *not* contain an azure square.\"\n  - output_grid_2: \"Is expected to be a 3x3 red sqaure, which the current code does *not* address.\"\n  - input_grid_3: \"Does *not* contain any azure squares\"\n  - output_grid_3: \"3x3 green sqaure\"\n  - program_focus: \"Needs to shift from *only* looking for azure squares to a more general rule that handles other cases.\"\n  - current_limitation: \"The code will fail on inputs that don't have any azure square\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Check for Azure:** First, examine the input grid to see if it contains any azure-colored (value 8) squares.\n2.  **Azure Square Rule:** If azure squares are present, identify the smallest azure square within the input grid. The output grid will be this smallest azure square.\n3.  **No Azure Case:** If no azure squares exists, then check the size of the output grid. The output must be a 3x3 square of a specific color.\n4. Determine the color of this square: red if output is a 3x3 and green if output is a 3x3.\n5. Return this extracted grid.\n\n"
