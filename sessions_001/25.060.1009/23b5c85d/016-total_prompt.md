Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels. There are distinct rectangular blocks of green (3), red (2), and magenta (6) pixels. The output appears to be a smaller grid containing only the magenta pixels. The spatial arrangement of the magenta pixels within the larger input grid seems to be preserved in the smaller output grid, albeit condensed. The white and other colored pixels from the input are not in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 10x15
      - colors: [0, 2, 3, 6]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 3x2
      - colors: [6]
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: green
      - dimensions: 8x4
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: red
      - dimensions: 4x3
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: magenta
      - dimensions: 3x2
actions:
  - type: filter
    description: Select only pixels of color 6 (magenta).
  - type: condense
    description: Remove empty rows and columns to create a minimal bounding grid.
relationships:
  - magenta_rectangle_location: The magenta rectangle is positioned in the bottom middle-left of the green rectangle.
  - red_rectangle_location: The red rectangle is position in the top right of the grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** Focus on pixels with the color value 6 (magenta).
2.  **Isolate Target Pixels:** Disregard all pixels that are not magenta.
3. **Construct Bounding Grid:** Create the smallest possible rectangular grid that contains all the magenta pixels, removing any completely empty rows or columns that resulted from removing the non-magenta pixels.
4.  **Output:** Return the resulting condensed grid of only magenta pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
