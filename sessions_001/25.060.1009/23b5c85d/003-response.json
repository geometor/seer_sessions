The input grid contains two distinct colored regions: a larger region of red (2) pixels enclosing a smaller square region of azure (8) pixels.  The output grid consists entirely of azure (8) pixels, matching the color and shape of the inner region in the input. The surrounding red and white regions are completely removed. The transformation seems to focus on extracting a specific sub-region.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
