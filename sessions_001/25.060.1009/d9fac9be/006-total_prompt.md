Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a very simple observation: identifying and counting red pixels.  It's clear from the results that this is overly simplistic and doesn't capture the full transformation logic.  The code correctly handles some cases (where the output is a single red pixel) but fails when there are multiple or zero red pixels and when other conditions are not accounted for, like the number of the red regions (discontiguous pixels).

Our strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze each example meticulously:**  Examine the input and output grids, noting not just the presence of red, but also the *number* of discontiguous single red pixels.
2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately reflect the relationship between the number of red pixel regions and the output.
3.  **Update the YAML facts,** describing objects, properties, and actions.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To get accurate metrics, I'll use a combination of observation and manual counting (since I can't execute code directly in this environment). I will describe and count each red region manually, then, use that as a reference to explain the result.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: Has one red pixel.
    *   Output: Has one red pixel.
    *   Result: Correct. The initial code works as expected in this simple case.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: Has two separated red pixels.
    *   Output: Has `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` two by two grid of white pixels.
    *   Result: Incorrect. The code outputs a single red pixel, not a 2x2 white grid.
    *  Observation: The output dimensions seem related with the number of separated red regions found.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: Has four single red pixels.
    *   Output: Has `[[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]` four by four grid of white pixels.
    *   Result: Incorrect. The code outputs a single red pixel, not a 4x4 white grid.
    * Observation: The output dimensions seem related with the number of separated red regions found.

*   **Example 4:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: Has a red 3x2 rectangle, a red 1x2, and two separated red single pixels.
    *   Output: Has `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]` two by two grid of white pixels.
    *   Result: Incorrect. Output has only one red pixel.
    * Observation: Counting only the *discontiguous single red pixels* produces a 2x2 all-white output.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: red_pixel
    description: A single pixel with the color red (value 2).
    properties:
      - color: red
      - value: 2
      - shape: 1x1
      - count: variable (depends on the input grid)

  - object: output_grid
    description: A grid containing only white pixels.
    properties:
      - color: white
      - value: 0
      - dimensions:  "N x N, where N is the number of discontiguous single red pixels in the input."

  - action: count_red_pixels
    description: Count the number of discontiguous 1x1 red pixels in the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: integer (count)

  - action: create_output_grid
    description: Create an N x N output grid filled with white pixels, where N is the count of discontiguous, single red pixels.
    input: integer (count from count_red_pixels)
    output: output_grid
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify and Count Discontiguous Red Pixels:** Examine the input grid and count only the *discontiguous single pixels* that are red (value 2). Ignore red regions of any other shape.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid will be a square grid of size N x N, where N is the number of discontiguous single red pixels counted in step 1.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an N x N grid filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
