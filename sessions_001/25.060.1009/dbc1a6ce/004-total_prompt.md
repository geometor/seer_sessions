Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color represented by a number (0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0) and blue (1). The transformation seems to involve introducing a new color, azure (8), in relation to the existing blue pixels. The azure color appears to "fill" areas adjacent to the blue pixels, forming a cross-like shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      cells:
        - value: 0-9  # Represents colors
          color_names: [white, blue, azure]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - value: 0
          name: white
        - value: 1
          name: blue
        - value: 8
          name: azure

actions:
  - name: fill_adjacent
    description: "Azure (8) pixels are placed adjacent to blue (1) pixels."

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: "Azure pixels are placed horizontally and vertically adjacent to blue pixels, creating a cross shape centered on the original blue pixel."
  - type: input_output
    description: The output grid extends the blue areas in the input by drawing cross with a new color, keeping the blue intact.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** blue pixel:
    *   **Place** an azure (8) pixel directly above it, if within the grid boundaries.
    *   **Place** an azure (8) pixel directly below it, if within the grid boundaries.
    *   **Place** an azure (8) pixel directly to the left of it, if within the grid boundaries.
    *   **Place** an azure (8) pixel directly to the right of it, if within the grid boundaries.
    *   **Place** Azure (8) to all adjecent sides of the blue pixel created on the previous step.
3. **Keep** the rest of the pixels of input grid unchanged.

In essence, the transformation draws an azure (8) cross around each blue (1) pixel, with the original blue pixel remaining at the center of each cross. The white(0) pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
