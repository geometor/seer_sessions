Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** Both input and output are 2D grids of the same dimensions (12x12).
*   **Colors:** The input grid primarily contains white (0) and blue (1) pixels. The output grid introduces azure (8) pixels while retaining some of the original blue and white pixels.
*   **Shapes:** The blue pixels in the input appear to form disconnected single-pixel objects or small clusters.
*   **Transformation:** The azure (8) pixels in the output seem to be related to the blue (1) pixels in the input, often appearing adjacent to them, sometimes replacing them, and sometimes extending from them. The azure pixels seem to "fill in" areas around the blue pixels, especially making a "cross" with the blue pixel in the center.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: blue_pixels
    type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    shape: individual or small clusters
    location: scattered throughout the grid
    input_state: present
    output_state: present or replaced

  - id: azure_pixels
    type: pixel
    color: azure (8)
    shape: clusters, often adjacent to blue pixels
    location: around blue pixels
    input_state: absent
    output_state: present

  - id: white_pixels
    type: pixel
    color: white (0)
    input_state: present
    output_state: present

actions:
  - name: fill_adjacent
    agent: unknown
    target: blue_pixels
    result: azure_pixels appear adjacent to blue_pixels, sometimes replacing them

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    from: azure_pixels
    to: blue_pixels
  - type: replacement
    from: blue_pixels
    to: azure_pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** blue pixel:
    *   **Check directly adjacent cells:** If there is a blue pixel in a cardinal direction, change it into azure.
    *   If a cell is empty/white in a cardinal direction and not out-of-bounds of the image: Add a new azure (8) pixel to the directly adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right) of that current blue pixel. If the original blue pixel had *any* adjacent blue pixels, replace all original directly-adjacent blue pixels with an azure pixel.

In summary: It creates a cross of azure pixels centered on blue pixels, with one-pixel padding around blue pixels when the blue pixels aren't touching other blue pixels. If blue pixels are touching other blue pixels, the blue pixels are turned into azure pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
