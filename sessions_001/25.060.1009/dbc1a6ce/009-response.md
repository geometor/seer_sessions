Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, with most pixels being white (0) and some being blue (1). The transformation seems to involve a new color, azure (8), appearing in relation to the blue pixels. The azure pixels appear to "fill in" areas horizontally adjacent to the blue pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - azure (8)
      position: [row, column]
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Horizontal connection between pixels.
actions:
  - type: fill
    agent: blue pixel
    target: horizontally adjacent white pixels
    result: change white pixels to azure
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** blue pixel:
    *   **Check** for horizontally adjacent white (0) pixels to the right.
    *   **Change** any continuous sequence of horizontally adjacent white (0) pixels to the right of the blue pixel into azure (8) pixels, stopping when a non-white pixel, or the edge of the grid, is met.
    *   Check for horizontally adjacent white pixels to the left.
    *    Change any continous sequence of horizontally adjacent white(0) pixels to the left of the blue pixel into azure (8) pixels, stopping when a non-white pixel, or the edge of the grid, is met.

In essence, the blue pixels act as "seeds" from which azure "grows" horizontally, overwriting white pixels until it encounters a boundary (a non-white pixel or the grid edge).
