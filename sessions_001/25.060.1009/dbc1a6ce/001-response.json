The transformation appears to involve a third color: azure (8). The azure pixels seem to be related to the blue pixels in the input, expanding or connecting them in some way. The shapes formed by the azure pixels are always lines and there is at least one azure pixel adjacent to each blue pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
