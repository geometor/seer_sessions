**input:**
```
6 6 6
0 0 0
6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7FC253C82450>

**output:**
```
6 0 0
6 0 6
6 0 6
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: magenta (6) and white (0). The output grid also contains magenta and white pixels, but their arrangement is different. The core transformation seems to involve a redistribution of the magenta and white pixels. It appears as though the magenta pixels are "moving" or being "rearranged".

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0, 6] # 0: white, 6: magenta

actions:
  - type: rearrangement
    description:  Pixels are moved within the grid.
    details:
      - magenta_pixels: maintain count, change position
      - white_pixels: maintain count, change position

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: positions of colored pixels within the grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Locate all magenta (6) and white (0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Maintain**: Preserve the same *number* of magenta and white pixels
3.  **Column Shift**:
     -   Magenta pixels in the top row of the input move to the left-most column in the output.
     -   White pixels fill the rest of the column in the original position
4. **Maintain** bottom-left corner from input to output
5. **Output**: second and third columns from the first row in the input go to the last two spaces on the bottom row.

In essence, it relocates all magenta to the first column and bottom row, without changing counts, and shifts the remaing white pixels to fill the remaining spaces.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
