**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 0 2
0 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7FC252B9ABD0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
0 0 2
2 0 0
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid containing values 0 (white) and 2 (red).
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid, also containing 0 (white) and 2 (red). It appears to be a modified version of the input grid.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve a change of position of the digits, which represent colors. It resembles a rotation or a reflection.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are both 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The grids contain only two colors: white (0) and red (2).
  - observation: |
      The output is related to the input. It appears the content of input is mirrored along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal
  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: grid
        dimensions: 3x3
        elements: [0, 2]
      - name: output_grid
        type: grid
        dimensions: 3x3
        elements: [0, 2]
  - actions:
      - name: reflect
        description: Reflect the grid along diagonal
        agent: system
        input: input_grid
        output: output_grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Take the 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Reflect:** Reflect/Mirror the input along the top-right to bottom-left diagonal. This means exchanging values along the anti-diagonal (from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner).
3.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

In essence, the transformation is an exchange of pixel values across this diagonal.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
