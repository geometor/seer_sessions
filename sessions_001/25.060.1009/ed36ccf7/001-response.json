Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a swap of values between some of the cells. There's a clear diagonal or rotational symmetry to be observed. The non-zero color swaps between the top left and the remaining parts of the first row and the first column, preserving their relative positions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
