observations:
  - object: 2x2 subgrid
    properties:
      - contains: 4 pixels
      - rotation: 90 degrees clockwise
    selection_criteria:
      - varied: Top-left pixel color is not consistent (8, 5, and 1 observed).
      - pattern_1: In examples 0, 2: subgrid colors are [[5, 1], [5, 8]].
      - pattern_2: In examples 1, 3: subgrid colors are [[5, 0], [0, 0]].
      - pattern_3: In example 4: subgrid colors are [[8,5], [1,8]]
      - location: The subgrid can appear at different locations within the larger grid.
    actions:
      - rotate: The subgrid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
  - grid:
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      - preserve: Pixels outside the selected 2x2 subgrid remain unchanged.
