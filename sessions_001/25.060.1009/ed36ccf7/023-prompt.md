Previous Code:
```python
"""
Reflects a 3x3 grid along its top-right to bottom-left diagonal.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by reflecting it along the top-right to
    bottom-left diagonal.

    Args:
        input_grid: A 3x3 list of lists representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A 3x3 list of lists representing the transformed grid.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input array
    output_array = np.copy(input_array)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
