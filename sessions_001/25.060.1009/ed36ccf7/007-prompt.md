Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rotates a specific 2x2 subgrid within the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise. The subgrid to be rotated is identified by having the color 8 (azure) in its top-left cell. If no such subgrid is found, the input grid remains unchanged.

1.  **Identify Potential Subgrids:** Examine all possible 2x2 subgrids within the input grid.
2.  **Locate Target Subgrid:** Find the 2x2 subgrid where the top-left cell is color 8 (azure).
3.  **Handle Absence:** If no such subgrid exists, the output is identical to the input.
4.  **Rotate:** If the target subgrid is found, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   The top-left cell moves to the top-right position.
    *   The top-right cell moves to the bottom-right position.
    *   The bottom-right cell moves to the bottom-left position.
    *   The bottom-left cell moves to the top-left position.
5.  **Preserve Rest:** All other pixels in the grid that are not part of the rotating subgrid remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
