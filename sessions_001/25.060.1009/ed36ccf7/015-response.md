Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and provide my observations.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 3x3 grids.
*   The grids contain two colors, represented by the digits 0 (white) and 9 (maroon).
*   The position of the colors changes between the input and output. It seems to be some sort of rotation or reflection.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors: [0, 9] # white, maroon
    input_state: "0 0 9; 0 0 9; 9 9 9"
    output_state: "9 9 9; 0 0 9; 0 0 9"
  - observation: The grid appears to be rotated or reflected.
  - input_object:
      color: maroon
      shape: L-shape
      position: bottom right
  - output_object:
      color: maroon
      shape: L-shape
      position: top-left, rotated 180.
  - action: The maroon L-shape has been rotated 180 degrees.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 180-degree rotation of the grid. The L-Shaped object made out of marron (9) pixels is being rotated.

1.  Take the Input Grid
2.  Rotate the entire contents of the grid by 180 degrees.
3.  Present the rotated grid.
