Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red and Green Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are red (value 2) or green (value 3).

2.  **Create Squares:** For each red and green pixel:
    *   Create a 3x3 square in the output grid with the same color as the original pixel.
    *   Center the 3x3 square on the location of the original pixel.

3.  **Handle Overlap:** Examine every cell in the output grid. If any cell is within *both* a red 3x3 square and a green 3x3 square, change its value to 5 (gray). It does *not* matter if the cell is currently 0, 2 or 3. If it's within overlapping squares, it becomes 5.

4.  **Blank Cells:** Any cells in the output grid that weren't filled by the above steps remain 0 (white/blank).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
