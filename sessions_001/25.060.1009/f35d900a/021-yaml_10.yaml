   description: Each initial pixel (3 and 8) expands outwards in a 3x3 mirrored block.
 - name: channel_creation
   description: A pathway of grey (5) pixels connects, and separates the original and mirrored blocks of the same color.
 - name: reflection
   description: the expanded blocks are created in a mirrored pattern.

relationships:
  - green_azure_adjacent: The green and azure pixels are initially diagonally adjacent to each other.
  - mirror_symmetry:  The 3x3 blocks created around the seed pixels are mirror images across rows and columns.
  - connector_path: The grey pixels form a straight line, like a channel, between mirror-expanded sections of same-color blocks.
