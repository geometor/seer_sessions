Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grid appears mostly empty (filled with 0s), with a few isolated non-zero pixels (2 and 3, representing red and green). The output grid has a more complex structure, with regions of different colors, and seems to be derived from a patterned interaction with the positions of the 2 and 3 pixels in the input grid, as well as gray (5) pixels that are not in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
