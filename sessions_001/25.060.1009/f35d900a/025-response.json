            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and made some assumptions that don't hold true for all examples. The core issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Distance Calculation:** The code uses Manhattan distance to find the nearest azure pixel to connect. This doesn't guarantee the *visually* nearest block in cases with vertical offsets.\n2.  **Overlapping Block Handling:** The code *attempts* some logic to prevent connections when extended blocks overlap horizontally, however it needs more rigorous handling of overlapping expanded pixels. Specifically, expanded blocks of the same color should merge.\n3.  **Connection Ambiguity:** More than one azure block may be nearest.\n4.   **Missing connections**\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Correct Object Identification**: Ensure the code correctly identifies the expanded 3x3 blocks as single objects, rather than individual pixels.\n2.  **Refine \"Nearest\" Definition:** Define \"nearest\" in terms of horizontal distance *after* expansion and merging. Connection happens only between the rightmost green cell and the leftmost azure.\n3. **Address the connection ambiguity**\n4.  **Overlap Handling:** Implement proper merging of overlapping expanded blocks of the same color.\n5. **All other pixels should be white**\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for accurate reports)**\n\nI'll use a combination of manual observation and small Python snippets to gather specific information about each example.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    \"\"\"Provides a basic description of the grid: dimensions and

with adjacent green blocks\n    connects_to: azure block\n\n  - type: block\n    color: azure (8)\n    initial_shape: 1x1\n    expanded_shape: 3x3\n    behavior: expands, merges with adjacent azure blocks\n    connects_to: green block\n\n  - type: path\n    color: grey (5)\n    behavior: connects rightmost edge of expanded green block to leftmost edge of nearest expanded azure block, horizontal line, only on center row of the green block.\n\nactions:\n  - expand: Each green and azure pixel becomes a 3x3 block of the same color.\n  - merge: Overlapping expanded blocks of the same color become a single contiguous block.\n  - connect:  A grey path connects the rightmost green block to the *nearest* leftmost azure block.\n  - background: set all other pixels to white\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Expansion and Merging:** Identify all green (3) and azure (8) pixels in the input grid. Expand each of these pixels into a 3x3 block of the same color, centered on the original pixel location. If expanded blocks of the *same* color overlap, merge them into a single, contiguous block.\n\n2.  **Nearest Block Connection:**\n    *   Iterate over all green blocks created from expansion (and merging).\n    * For each green block, find the \"nearest\" Azure Block\n    *   The \"nearest\" block is defined as having the minimum horizontal distance between the rightmost edge of the green block and the leftmost edge of the azure block. The vertical position is not relevant for determining the \"nearest\".\n    *  Connect the blocks. Create a horizontal path of grey (5) pixels extending from the rightmost column of the green block to the leftmost column of the *nearest* azure block.\n    * This connection path must be placed on the row that corresponds to the vertical center of the green block.\n    * If a green block and azure block overlap, do not draw a connector\n\n3. **Background**: all cells not occupied by expanded blocks or connector path are white.\n\n"
