objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    shape: dynamic  # Can be 1x1, 3x1, 1x3, or 3x3
    behavior: expands based on proximity to other red or yellow objects
  - color: yellow
    value: 4
    shape: dynamic  # Can be 1x1, 3x1, 1x3, or 3x3
    behavior: expands based on proximity to other red or yellow objects
  - color: gray
    value: 5
    shape: 1x1
    behavior: appears at intersections of expanded red and yellow objects
  - color: white
    value: 0
    shape: 1x1 # background
    behavior: default fill color, remains unchanged unless overlapped

actions:
  - name: expand
    target: red and yellow objects
    rules:
      - condition: "if red object is in same row as another red or yellow object, but not same column"
        result: "expand to 3x1 vertically"
      - condition: "if red object is in same column as another red or yellow object, but not same row"
        result: "expand to 1x3 horizontally"
      - condition: "if red object is in same row AND same column as another red or yellow object"
        result: "expand to 3x3"
      - condition: "same rules apply to yellow objects"
  - name: intersect
    target: expanded red and yellow objects
    rules:
      - condition: "expanded regions overlap"
      - result: "overlapping pixels become gray (5)"
  - name: preserve
    target: background
    rules:
        - condition: pixels that are not red, yellow or gray after expansion
        - result: pixels remain white
