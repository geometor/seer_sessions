<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=4000x2256 at 0x7FC25B62EBD0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (input and output) containing colored pixels represented by numbers 0-9. The primary elements are colored "objects" formed by contiguous pixels of the same color. There's a consistent transformation between the input and output grids, suggesting a rule-based manipulation of these objects. The transformation seems to involve a combination of:

1.  **Object Identification:** Identifying distinct colored objects in the input.
2.  **Replication/Expansion:** Creating multiple copies or expanding the identified objects.
3.  **Placement:** Positioning the replicated/expanded objects in a specific arrangement in the output grid.
4.  **Background Insertion:** A grey (color 5) object seems to fill spaces between and around replicated color objects.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: colored_pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - shape: contiguous block
      - size: number of pixels
    actions:
      - identified: input grid
      - replicated: output grid
      - expanded: output grid
      - positioned: output grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    details:
      - input_objects: Original objects in input.
      - output_objects: Replicated/Expanded objects in output.
      - background_objects:  Gray filling around objects in output.

  - type: transformation
    details:
      - replication_pattern: "Creates copies of original objects."
      - expansion_pattern: "Expands objects by adding a layer of the objects color around each object."
      - placement_pattern: "Mirrors objects across a vertical central axis, gray object filling in available gaps"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify all distinct, contiguous colored pixel groups (objects). Treat each isolated colored object.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each colored pixel in an object, a horizontal line with length 3 and the color of the object is created, where the original pixel is at the center of the line.
3. **Vertical Expansion:** For each colored pixel in an object, a vertical line with length 3 and the color of the object is created, where the original pixel is at the center of the line.
4.  **Mirroring:** If one object is to the left/right of the horizontal center of the input, its mirrored position will be on the right/left of the horizontal center of the output.
5.  **Create background:** After expansion/mirroring of objects, if there are empty pixels between and around the expanded pixels of the objects, a grey pixel (color 5) will be placed.
6.  **Fill Background:** Fill the remaining empty cells in the output grid with color 0 (white/blank).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
