The input grid contains isolated instances of green (3) and azure (8) pixels. The output grid appears to construct a mirrored, interlocking pattern around the original pixel locations, with grey (5) pixels filling a sort of 'channel' between them. The background is white (0).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These are the \"seed\" pixels.\n\n2. **Mirror Expansion:** For each seed pixel, create a 3x3 block of the same color centered on the seed pixel's original location.\n\n3. **Reflection:** The expanded blocks appear mirrored. The azure block at (3,12) expands to the mirrored location of the green block at (8,12) and vice-versa.\n\n4. **Grey Channel Creation:**  Connect the expanded green blocks with a horizontal path of grey (5) pixels. Similarly connect expanded azure blocks. The gray channels follow the most direct route - one segment per pair. Grey pixels do *not* form 3x3 blocks.\n\n5. **Fill Background:** All remaining pixels are white (0).\n"
