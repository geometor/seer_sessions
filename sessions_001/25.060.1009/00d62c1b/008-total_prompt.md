The transformation rule is to insert a yellow (4) pixel between any two adjacent green (3) pixels in the horizontal or vertical direction. If there are no green pixels, the output is identical to the input.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to insert a yellow pixel between adjacent green pixels, both horizontally and vertically. The testing revealed that it mostly works.
The problem is that the code does both horizontal and vertical checks, and adds the rows and cols as it iterates.
It also has some strange row insertions at the end that is not related to the original logic.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Simplify Insertion Logic:** Iterate and mark locations, perform insertions in separate step.
2.  **Fix Final Row Insertions:** remove that code since it does not relate to the
    original logic.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the results:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:**
    ```
    [[3 4 3 4 3 1 3 4 3 4 3]]
    ```
*   **Observation:** Correct.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*    **Actual Output:**
    ```
    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]
    ```
*   **Observation:** Almost correct. There is an added row of yellow at the end.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[3, 0, 3],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [3, 0, 3]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[3, 0, 3],
     [0, 0, 0],
     [3, 0, 3]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:**
    ```
    [[3 0 3]
     [0 0 0]
     [3 0 3]]
    ```
*   **Observation:** Correct.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_pixel
    color: 3
    description: Pixels with the value 3 (green).
  - name: yellow_pixel
    color: 4
    description: Pixels with the value 4 (yellow). These are inserted.
  - name: other_pixel
    color: other
    description: pixels that are not green

actions:
  - name: insert_yellow
    description: Insert a yellow pixel between two adjacent green pixels.
    direction: horizontal or vertical
    condition: Two green pixels are adjacent.

grid_properties:
  - adjacency: Important for determining where to insert yellow pixels.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all green (3) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each green pixel, check if it has any adjacent green pixels in the horizontal or vertical directions.
3.  **Insert:** If two green pixels are adjacent horizontally, insert a yellow (4) pixel between them. If two green pixels are adjacent vertically, insert a yellow (4) pixel between them.
4.  **Otherwise:** If no two green pixels are adjacent, return grid with no changes.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
