            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to insert a yellow pixel between adjacent green pixels, both horizontally and vertically. The testing revealed that it mostly works.\nThe problem is that the code does both horizontal and vertical checks, and adds the rows and cols as it iterates.\nIt also has some strange row insertions at the end that is not related to the original logic.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Simplify Insertion Logic:** Iterate and mark locations, perform insertions in separate step.\n2.  **Fix Final Row Insertions:** remove that code since it does not relate to the\n    original logic.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the results:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    [[3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3]]\n    ```\n*   **Actual Output:**\n    ```\n    [[3 4 3 4 3 1 3 4 3 4 3]]\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** Correct.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n*    **Actual Output:**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** Almost correct. There is an added row of yellow at the end.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    [[3, 0, 3],\n     [0, 0, 0],\n     [3, 0, 3]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[3, 0, 3],\n     [0, 0, 0],\n     [3, 0, 3]]\n    ```\n*   **Actual Output:**\n    ```\n    [[3 0 3]\n     [0 0 0]\n     [3 0 3]]\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** Correct.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: green_pixel\n    color: 3\n    description: Pixels with the value 3 (green).\n  - name: yellow_pixel\n    color: 4\n    description: Pixels with the value 4 (yellow). These are inserted.\n  - name: other_pixel\n    color: other\n    description: pixels that are not green\n\nactions:\n  - name: insert_yellow\n    description: Insert a yellow pixel between two adjacent green pixels.\n    direction: horizontal or vertical\n    condition: Two green pixels are adjacent.\n\ngrid_properties:\n  - adjacency: Important for determining where to insert yellow pixels.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify:** Locate all green (3) pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each green pixel, check if it has any adjacent green pixels in the horizontal or vertical directions.\n3.  **Insert:** If two green pixels are adjacent horizontally, insert a yellow (4) pixel between them. If two green pixels are adjacent vertically, insert a yellow (4) pixel between them.\n4.  **Otherwise:** If no two green pixels are adjacent, return grid with no changes.\n\n"
