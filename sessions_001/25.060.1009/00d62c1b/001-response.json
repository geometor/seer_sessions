Here's my analysis of the transformation:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The primary colors involved seem to be green (3) and yellow (4), with a background of white (0). The transformation appears to involve selectively changing some green pixels (3) to yellow (4). The shape and size of the green regions vary, but the change seems related to connectivity and adjacency of green cells.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

From careful observation we can say the following:\n    *   If a green pixel has two or more green neighbors, then the center pixel become yellow.\n    *  All other green pixels not satisfying the center pixel condition from above remain the same color.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input. Copy all non-green pixels directly from the input to the output. For the green pixels, apply the rule described above changing its value to 4 (yellow), otherwise maintaining the value of 3.\n\nEssentially, the transformation identifies some \"center\" green pixels based on how they are connected with neighbors and changes their color to yellow. The transformation preserves all pixels that are not green and some of green pixels that do not have a sufficient number of neighbors.\n"
