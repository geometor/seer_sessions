<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3776x2640 at 0x7FC253D4C5D0>Okay, I've reviewed the example input-output pairs. Here's my analysis of the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The primary colors involved seem to be green (3) and yellow (4), with a background of white (0). The transformation appears to involve selectively changing some green pixels (3) to yellow (4). The shape and size of the green regions vary, but the change seems related to connectivity and adjacency of green cells.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x columns)
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - 0: white
          - 3: green
          - 4: yellow
      - position: (row, column)
      - adjacency:  pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonal)

actions:
  - type: color_change
    properties:
      - from_color: 3 (green)
      - to_color: 4 (yellow)
    conditions:
      - adjacency: The green pixel is adjacent to other green pixels. The extent and logic of the transformation needs further clarification.

relationships:
    - adjacency: determines which pixels are considered neighbors
    - connectivity: groups of adjacent pixels of the same color form connected regions or shapes.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Apply Transformation Rule**: Iterate through the green regions. From careful observation we can say the following:
    *   If a green pixel has two or more green neighbors, then the center pixel become yellow.
    *  All other green pixels not satisfying the center pixel condition from above remain the same color.

3.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input. Copy all non-green pixels directly from the input to the output. For the green pixels, apply the rule described above changing its value to 4 (yellow), otherwise maintaining the value of 3.

Essentially, the transformation identifies some "center" green pixels based on how they are connected with neighbors and changes their color to yellow. The transformation preserves all pixels that are not green and some of green pixels that do not have a sufficient number of neighbors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
