Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  Preserve the background: White (0) pixels remain unchanged.
2.  Fill Interior: All green pixels that are not on the edge of a contiguous green object become yellow.
    In other words, if a green pixel is completely surrounded by other green pixels (not diagonally), it changes to yellow (4).
    Green pixels adjacent to any white pixel, remain green.

    """Gets the neighbors of a cell (up, down, left, right)."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    neighbors = []

        neighbors.append(grid[row - 1, col])  # Up

        for col in range(cols):
            # Check if the pixel is green (3)

                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, row, col)

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying interior green pixels and changing them to yellow. This rule works for the first example but fails on the others. The other examples introduce additional considerations. The failures indicate that the current program is too specific and needs to generalize to handle different scenarios present in the other examples. The program fails on example three because there is no background to consider. We need to consider edge cases to make sure we are accounting for all possibilities and revise the natural language program and resulting code.

**Strategy:**
My strategy is to check the actual results against the expected results and then update the natural language program based on these deltas.

**Metrics and Observations:**
Here's a breakdown of each example and the observed results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid with a green border and a single yellow pixel in the center.
    *   Expected Output: Same as input.
    *   Actual Output: Same as input.
    *   Result: Success.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid with green squares in the corners and center, forming a '+' shape.
    *   Expected Output: Same as input.
    *   Actual Output: Same as input.
    *   Result: Success.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid, entirely green.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3 grid, entirely green.
    *   Actual output: middle pixel changed to yellow
    *   Result: Failure, only center pixel should be yellow.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: rectangle
        color: green
        description: outer border
      - type: pixel
        color: yellow
        description: center pixel
    background:
      color: white
  output:
     objects:
      - type: rectangle
        color: green
        description: outer border
      - type: pixel
        color: yellow
        description: center pixel
    background:
      color: white
  transformation:
    rule: "No change, all objects within the background remain the same."

example_2:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: shape
        color: green
        description: '+' shape made of 5 squares
    background:
      color: white
  output:
    objects:
      - type: shape
        color: green
        description: '+' shape made of 5 squares
    background:
      color: white
  transformation:
    rule: "No change, the green '+' shape within the white background remains unchanged"

example_3:
  input:
    objects:
      - type: rectangle
        color: green
        description: entire grid
  output:
    objects:
      - type: rectangle
        color: green
        description: entire grid
  transformation:
    rule: "No change. the green color is not changed."

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through all pixels.
2.  If a pixel is green determine if there is a white neighbor. If so, leave it green. If a pixel is completely surrounded by green, change it to yellow.
3.  If there is no background, do not make any transformations.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
