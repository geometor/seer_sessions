Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output grids are the same dimensions (20x20).
*   The input grid contains only white (0) and green (3) pixels.
*   The output grid contains white (0), green (3), and yellow (4) pixels.
*   The green (3) pixels in the input seem to mostly remain green (3) in the output.
*   Some green (3) pixels, specifically those adjacent to other green(3) pixels, are replaced by Yellow(4).
*   It appears that isolated green objects may remain, but clusters are changing.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: white (0)
    description: The background canvas of the grid.

  - id: green_pixel
    color: green (3)
    description: Individual pixels or contiguous groups of green color.

  - id: yellow_pixel
    color: yellow (4)
    description: new color, appears to be within green_pixel clusters

rules:
  - name: background_stays
    action: background remains background
    description: background pixels (white, 0) in the input remain unchanged in the output.

  - name: fill_interior
    condition: green pixel is within the interior of another object
    action: change to yellow
    description: Green pixels inside object are changed to yellow

  - name: single_pixel_object_stays_green
    condition: green pixel object with one pixel
    action: keep green

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: Yellow pixels appear adjacent to green pixels, suggesting an interaction or transformation based on proximity.
    - type: containment
      description:  yellow pixels in input are within the area previously all green

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the output grid being identical to the input grid.
2.  **Background Preservation:** All white (0) pixels in the input remain white (0) in the output.
3.  **Interior fill:** All green pixels that are not on the edge of a contiguous green object become yellow. In other words, if a green pixel is completely surrounded by other green pixels, it changes to yellow (4). Green pixels touching a white pixel, remain green.

Essentially, the transformation "fills in" the interior of green objects, and edge pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
