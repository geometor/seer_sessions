"""
1.  **Identify Closed Green Region:** Locate a closed, contiguous region of green (value 3) pixels in the input grid. A closed region is defined as one where all green pixels are connected (8-way adjacency) and completely enclosed by non-green pixels, forming a boundary.
2.  **Fill Interior of Green Region:** Change the color of all the internal pixels of the identified closed green regions from green (3) to yellow (4).
3.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the modified region. All other pixels in the grid retain their original colors.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
