Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color within the input grid.
2.  **Select Target Object:** Select the object with color 2 (red).
3.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle that contains the entirety of the red object. The top-left coordinate will determine the output size, starting from 0,0.
4. **Extract and Transform:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with dimensions relative to the target object. Copy only the red object's pixels to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions. This is, in essence, cropping and extracting the sub-grid defined by the object
5.  **Discard Other Objects:** Ignore all objects that are not red.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code focused on identifying and extracting the red object (color 2) within the input grid. This approach worked correctly for the first example, but the results on the subsequent examples reveal a critical flaw: the program assumes there is *only one* red object, and selects it as the object to crop. The presence of multiple red objects, or the requirement to perform additional actions beyond simple extraction.

Here's the core issue and the strategy:

*   **Problem:** The initial program is too specific, only cropping a single red object, and does not account for cases where there might be more than one red element or a different action needs to be performed.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  **Gather Detailed Information:** Analyze *all* training examples meticulously. Identify all objects (not just red ones), their relationships (positions, sizes, colors), and any other visual patterns. Pay close attention to the differences between the input and output grids.
    2.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed information, create a more generalized and robust natural language program that accurately captures the *full* transformation logic, even if it involves multiple steps or conditions.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To get accurate information about the grids, I will use a function that extracts relevant details:

```python
import numpy as np

def grid_info(grid):
    """
    Extracts information from a grid: dimensions, unique colors, and object counts.
    """
    objects = find_objects(grid)
    colors = sorted(list(set([c for c, _ in objects])))
    object_counts = {}
    for color, coords in objects:
        if color not in object_counts:
            object_counts[color] = 0
        object_counts[color] += 1

    return {
        'shape': grid.shape,
        'colors': colors,
        'object_counts': object_counts
    }

    """

    """
    results = []
    for example in task_data['train']:  # Process only training examples
        input_info = grid_info(np.array(example['input']))
        output_info = grid_info(np.array(example['output']))
        results.append({
            'input': input_info,
            'output': output_info
        })
    return results

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color in the input grid.
2.  **Target Object(s):** Focus on objects of color 2 (red).
3.  **Find smallest red object:** Of the red objects, find the object with the smallest area.
4. **Determine Bounding Box of smallest shape:** Find the smallest rectangle that contains all pixels of the *smallest* red object.
5.  **Extract and Transform:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the dimensions of the bounding box determined in the previous step. Copy *only* the pixels of the smallest red object to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding box.
6.  **Discard Other Objects:** Ignore all other objects and colors.

This revised natural language program now considers all of the examples. It correctly identifies that we need to find the smallest red object, calculate the bounding box *of the smallest red object*, and extract *that* to a new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
