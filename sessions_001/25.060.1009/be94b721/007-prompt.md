Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color in the input grid.
2.  **Target Object(s):** Focus on objects of color 2 (red).
3.  **Find smallest red object:** Of the red objects, find the object with the smallest area.
4. **Determine Bounding Box of smallest shape:** Find the smallest rectangle that contains all pixels of the *smallest* red object.
5.  **Extract and Transform:** Create a new grid (the output grid) with the dimensions of the bounding box determined in the previous step. Copy *only* the pixels of the smallest red object to the output grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding box.
6.  **Discard Other Objects:** Ignore all other objects and colors.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
