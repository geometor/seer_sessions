Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid. The most prominent visual feature in the input grids is a vertical column of blue pixels (color 1). The output grids seem to be derived from the input, significantly reduced in size, and feature azure pixels (color 8) in locations related to, but not a direct copy of, the blue column. The surrounding pixels are primarily white (0), maroon (9) . The height of the output grid is always the same of input one, while the width changes.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - feature: vertical_blue_column
        color: 1 (blue)
        location: column_index_varies
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0, 8)
      - height: same as input
      - width: 3
      - feature: azure_pixels
        color: 8 (azure)
        location: related_to_blue_column
  - transformation:
      - action: resize
        details: output grid is smaller
      - action: map_color
        details: blue column transforms, partially, in azure pixels and other colors disappear, turning into white.
      - parameters:
          output_width: 3

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Blue Column:** Locate the vertical column of blue (1) pixels within the input grid. Note its horizontal position (column index).
2. **Create output skeleton:** Create a new output grid. The output grid has the same number of rows of input grid, and has a fixed width of 3 columns. Initialize it by value 0.
3.  **Map Blue Column to Azure:**
    *   Iterate the rows of input grid, using the row index.
    *   If exists any blue pixel in the input row, put an azure pixel (8) in the output grid.
    * The azure pixel position is given from two factors: the relative position respect the blue column, and the borders of a 3x3 subgrid around the relative postion.
4.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid, not part of azure mapping, remain white (0).
