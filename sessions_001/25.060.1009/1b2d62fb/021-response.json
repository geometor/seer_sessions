The input grid appears to have a vertical blue stripe in the center, surrounded by maroon, white and other colors. The output grid is smaller and seems to be derived from the blue stripe, replacing the blue with azure, and using a pattern of azure and white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This stripe acts as the primary source of transformation.\n2. **Extract column:** Use central column to create new grid\n3.  **Resize:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input stripe but a new width, which would be fixed number.\n4.  **Color Mapping:**\n    *   Change all blue pixels from the original stripe to azure (color 8).\n    *   Change all the other pixels to the white (color 0).\n5. **Create checkered pattern:** Create 3-wide vertical pattern where color alternates white-azure-azure in a column, but in the next row it is offset and starts azure-white-azure.\n\n"
