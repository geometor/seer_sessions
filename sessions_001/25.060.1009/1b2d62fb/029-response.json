            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good start, correctly identifying the core concept of locating a blue vertical stripe and using it as a reference. However, the initial implementation had a couple limitations that were discovered by applying the code to all train examples:\n\n1.  **Incomplete Pattern**: It made assumptions that all values of the identified column were the same color.\n2.  **Size/Position Restriction**: The output grid was always 5x3 with the start position 0-4.\n3.  **Overly Specific Color Mapping**: The assumption that all pixels in selected\n    region should either be 8 or 0.\n\nThe strategy for improvement will involve:\n* look at the grid shape to determine if it can be used\n* inspect train output 0 to see what makes this different from the other\n  examples\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo better understand the transformation, let's examine each example pair. I'll focus on:\n\n*   Input and Output grid shapes.\n*   Location of the blue vertical stripe.\n*   How the output relates to the input, spatially.\n\nI will use the provided `code_execution` to help me evaluate the numpy arrays.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)\ntrain_examples = [\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n        ]),\n        \"output\": np.array([\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        ]),\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": np.array([\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n        ]),\n        \"output\": np.array([\n            [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n        ]),\n    },\n   {\n        \"input\": np.array([\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,1,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,1,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,1,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,1,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,1,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,4,4]\n        ]),\n        \"output\": np.array([\n            [0, 0, 8, 0],\n            [0, 0, 8, 0],\n            [0, 0, 8, 0],\n            [0, 0, 8, 0],\n            [0, 0, 8, 0],\n        ]),\n    },\n   {\n        \"input\": np.array([\n            [4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,4,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,4,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,4,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,4,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,4,4],\n            [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,4,4,4,4,4]\n        ]),\n        \"output\": np.array([\n            [0, 8, 0, 0],\n            [0, 8, 0, 0],\n            [0, 8, 0, 0],\n            [0, 8, 0, 0],\n            [0, 8, 0, 0],\n        ]),\n    },\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(train_examples):\n    input_grid = example['input']\n    output_grid = example['output']\n    stripe_col = find_vertical_stripe(input_grid, 1)\n    print(f\"Example {i}:\")\n    print(f\"  Input shape: {input_grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Output shape: {output_grid.shape}\")\n    print(f\"  Stripe column: {stripe_col}\")\n\n```\n\n```text\nExample 0:\n  Input shape: (6, 10)\n  Output shape: (6, 10)\n  Stripe column: -1\nExample 1:\n  Input shape: (6, 10)\n  Output shape: (5, 5)\n  Stripe column: 5\nExample 2:\n  Input shape: (6, 15)\n  Output shape: (5, 4)\n  Stripe column: 13\nExample 3:\n  Input shape: (6, 15)\n  Output shape: (5, 4)\n  Stripe column: 3\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\n- example_0:\n    input_shape: [6, 10]\n    output_shape: [6, 10]\n    blue_stripe_exists: false\n    transformation: \"output is all zeros\"\n- example_1:\n    input_shape: [6, 10]\n    output_shape: [5, 5]\n    blue_stripe_exists: true\n    blue_stripe_column: 5\n    output_column_count: 5 # Includes stripe column and 2 on each side\n    transformation: |\n      A region of interest (ROI) is defined around a vertical blue stripe.\n      The ROI's width is 5, centered on the stripe.

A region of interest (ROI) is defined around this stripe.\n\n4.  **Determine ROI Dimensions**: The width of the output is the width of the region of interest and the height is the first five rows, starting at 0.\n *   The width is either 4 or 5, based on where the blue stripe is in\n        relation to the width of the input grid\n        + examples 2 and 3 have widths of 15 - when the blue stripe is toward the\n          beginning or the end of the grid, then the width is 4, if the\n          stripe is toward the middle (example 1 - width of 10) then\n          the width of the ROI is 5.\n        + examples 1, 2, and 3 show that the position of the column is at most\n          2 columns from center - round(output.x / 2)\n5.  **Color Mapping within ROI:**\n    *   Pixels within the ROI that are blue (1) in the input grid become azure (8) in the output grid.\n    *   All other pixels within the ROI become white (0) in the output grid.\n\n6. **Output:** return the transformed grid.\n"
