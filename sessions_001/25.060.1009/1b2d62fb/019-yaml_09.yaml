facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain blue (1) pixels. Other colors may be present but are not relevant to the current understanding of the transformation.
  - observation: |
      The output grids contain azure (8) pixels at the same locations where certain blue (1) pixels were in the input grids.
  - observation: |
       In each row, the *first* blue pixel position is where the azure pixel will appear in the output.
  - observation: |
      If a row has multiple blue pixels, only the *first* blue is transformed into azure, and only in the output.
  - observation: |
      If a row contains no blue pixels, the row remains unchanged.
