Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Central Stripe:** Locate the vertical stripe of blue (color 1) pixels in the input grid. This stripe acts as the primary source of transformation.
2. **Extract column:** Use central column to create new grid
3.  **Resize:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input stripe but a new width, which would be fixed number.
4.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Change all blue pixels from the original stripe to azure (color 8).
    *   Change all the other pixels to the white (color 0).
5. **Create checkered pattern:** Create 3-wide vertical pattern where color alternates white-azure-azure in a column, but in the next row it is offset and starts azure-white-azure.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution across all training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a central blue stripe, recoloring, and creating a checkered pattern. While this worked for the first example, it fails to generalize to the other examples. The core issue is that the transformation isn't solely dependent on a "central blue stripe." The other examples reveal different spatial relationships and color mappings.  We need a more flexible approach that accounts for these variations. The provided code *does* transform the inputs and the key is to understand the additional constraints that differentiate the examples and what might have caused the errors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of *each* training example. Pay close attention to:
    *   The presence and location of blue pixels.
    *   The relationship between the input and output grid sizes.
    *   The specific color changes.
    *   Any emerging patterns or regularities (e.g., repetition, symmetry).

2.  **Identify Common Elements and Differences:** Determine what aspects of the transformation are consistent across examples and where they diverge.

3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect a more general rule that encompasses all examples. This might involve:
    *   Abstracting away from the "central blue stripe" concept if it's not universally applicable.
    *   Defining more precise conditions for color mapping and spatial transformations.
    *   Using more general geometric terms (e.g., "column," "row," "adjacent").

4. **Prioritize Simplicity:** Favor solutions which require the fewest assumptions.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To help with this analysis, I will gather some metrics:

    print(f'{grid_name} pixel counts: {color_counts}')
    blue_indices = np.where(grid == 1)
    print(f'{grid_name} blue pixel locations: {list(zip(blue_indices[0], blue_indices[1]))}')

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
