Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate:** Find the vertical column of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Crop:** Create a 5x3 output grid. The x index of the center column of this grid corresponds to the center column of the 1's in the input grid. The y range goes from 0 to 4.
3. **Color Mapping:** Find the positions with respect to the input grid that should be copied over.
4.  **Transform:** Fill the output grid. All positions that have color 1 in the input grid get color 8. Every other pixel gets color 0.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
