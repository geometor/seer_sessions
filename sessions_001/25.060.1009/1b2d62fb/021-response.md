Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a vertical blue stripe in the center, surrounded by maroon, white and other colors. The output grid is smaller and seems to be derived from the blue stripe, replacing the blue with azure, and using a pattern of azure and white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      colors: [0, 9, 1]  # white, maroon, blue
      dimensions: [5, 7]
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      colors: [0, 8]    # white, azure
      dimensions: [5, 3]
  - observation: blue_stripe_in_input
    description: The input grid has a central vertical stripe of blue (1) pixels.
  - observation: output_related_to_blue_stripe
    description: The output grid seems to derive from the input's blue stripe.
  - observation: size reduction
     description: output grid is smaller than input grid
  - relationship: color change
      description: Blue turns into azure
  - relationship: structure change
      description: Vertical shape in input turns into a checkered pattern in output

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Stripe:** Locate the vertical stripe of blue (color 1) pixels in the input grid. This stripe acts as the primary source of transformation.
2. **Extract column:** Use central column to create new grid
3.  **Resize:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input stripe but a new width, which would be fixed number.
4.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Change all blue pixels from the original stripe to azure (color 8).
    *   Change all the other pixels to the white (color 0).
5. **Create checkered pattern:** Create 3-wide vertical pattern where color alternates white-azure-azure in a column, but in the next row it is offset and starts azure-white-azure.
