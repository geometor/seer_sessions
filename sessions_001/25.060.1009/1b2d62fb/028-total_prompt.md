**input:**
```
0 9 9 1 9 0 9
9 0 9 1 9 9 9
9 9 9 1 0 0 9
9 0 0 1 9 0 0
9 9 9 1 0 0 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x320 at 0x7FC253C82650>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 8 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7FC252BE67D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid seems to have a prominent vertical blue stripe (color 1) in the center.  The output grid is smaller than the input grid and seems to focus on a specific region of the input grid. The colors in the output grid are mostly white (0), with two azure (8) pixels appearing where the blue stripe was located in the input. The output seems to be a 3x5 crop of the input and the colors are transformed, 1->8 and every other color to 0.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: 5x7
      colors: [0, 9, 1]
      elements:
        - type: vertical_stripe
          color: 1
          location: center_column
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: 5x3
      colors: [0, 8]
      elements:
       - type: region
         location: corresponds to input stripe location, last two are color 8
  - transformation:
      type: color_change_and_crop
      rules:
        - from: 1
          to: 8
        - from: other
          to: 0
      crop:
        width: 3
        height: 5
        x_start: input_grid.center_column - 1
        y_start: 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Find the vertical column of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Crop:** Create a 5x3 output grid. The x index of the center column of this grid corresponds to the center column of the 1's in the input grid. The y range goes from 0 to 4.
3. **Color Mapping:** Find the positions with respect to the input grid that should be copied over.
4.  **Transform:** Fill the output grid. All positions that have color 1 in the input grid get color 8. Every other pixel gets color 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
