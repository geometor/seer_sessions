The output is a smaller grid, mostly white with two azure pixels. The input has a distinct vertical blue stripe in the center. The output seems to correspond to a condensed, lower portion of the blue stripe, changed to azure. The spatial relationship between the blue stripe in the input and the azure pixels in the output is key. The width and height of the input and output grids are different.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
