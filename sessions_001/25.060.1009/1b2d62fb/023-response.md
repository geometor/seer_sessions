Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution across all training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a central blue stripe, recoloring, and creating a checkered pattern. While this worked for the first example, it fails to generalize to the other examples. The core issue is that the transformation isn't solely dependent on a "central blue stripe." The other examples reveal different spatial relationships and color mappings.  We need a more flexible approach that accounts for these variations. The provided code *does* transform the inputs and the key is to understand the additional constraints that differentiate the examples and what might have caused the errors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output of *each* training example. Pay close attention to:
    *   The presence and location of blue pixels.
    *   The relationship between the input and output grid sizes.
    *   The specific color changes.
    *   Any emerging patterns or regularities (e.g., repetition, symmetry).

2.  **Identify Common Elements and Differences:** Determine what aspects of the transformation are consistent across examples and where they diverge.

3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect a more general rule that encompasses all examples. This might involve:
    *   Abstracting away from the "central blue stripe" concept if it's not universally applicable.
    *   Defining more precise conditions for color mapping and spatial transformations.
    *   Using more general geometric terms (e.g., "column," "row," "adjacent").

4. **Prioritize Simplicity:** Favor solutions which require the fewest assumptions.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To help with this analysis, I will gather some metrics:

    blue_indices = np.where(grid == 1)
    print(f'{grid_name} blue pixel locations: {list(zip(blue_indices[0], blue_indices[1]))}')
