Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Check for Blue Stripe:** Examine the input grid for a vertical stripe of blue (color 1) pixels. A vertical stripe is defined as a column where *at least one* pixel is blue.
2.  **Handle Absence of Stripe:** If no blue stripe is found, the output grid is a copy of the input grid, and all the values become 0.
3.  **Define Region of Interest (ROI):** If a blue stripe is present, determine the column index of the stripe. A region of interest (ROI) is defined around this stripe.
4.  **Determine ROI Dimensions**: 
    *   The output's height is 5, and its width is determined by the position of the blue stripe within the grid, being either 4 or 5.
    *    The width is either 4 or 5, based on where the blue stripe is in relation to the width of the input grid
        + examples 2 and 3 have widths of 15 - when the blue stripe is toward the
          beginning or the end of the grid, then the width is 4, if the
          stripe is toward the middle (example 1 - width of 10) then
          the width of the ROI is 5.
        + examples 1, 2, and 3 show that the position of the column is at most
          2 columns from center - round(output.x / 2)
5.  **Color Mapping within ROI:**
    *   Pixels within the ROI that are blue (1) in the input grid become azure (8) in the output grid.
    *   All other pixels within the ROI become white (0) in the output grid.
6. **Output:** return the transformed grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
