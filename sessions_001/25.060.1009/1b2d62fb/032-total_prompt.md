Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Check for Blue Stripe:** Examine the input grid for a vertical stripe of blue (color 1) pixels. A vertical stripe is defined as a column where *at least one* pixel is blue.
2.  **Handle Absence of Stripe:** If no blue stripe is found, the output grid is a copy of the input grid, and all the values become 0.
3.  **Define Region of Interest (ROI):** If a blue stripe is present, determine the column index of the stripe. A region of interest (ROI) is defined around this stripe.
4.  **Determine ROI Dimensions**: 
    *   The output's height is 5, and its width is determined by the position of the blue stripe within the grid, being either 4 or 5.
    *    The width is either 4 or 5, based on where the blue stripe is in relation to the width of the input grid
        + examples 2 and 3 have widths of 15 - when the blue stripe is toward the
          beginning or the end of the grid, then the width is 4, if the
          stripe is toward the middle (example 1 - width of 10) then
          the width of the ROI is 5.
        + examples 1, 2, and 3 show that the position of the column is at most
          2 columns from center - round(output.x / 2)
5.  **Color Mapping within ROI:**
    *   Pixels within the ROI that are blue (1) in the input grid become azure (8) in the output grid.
    *   All other pixels within the ROI become white (0) in the output grid.
6. **Output:** return the transformed grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, focusing on the presence of a blue vertical stripe and defining a region of interest (ROI) around it. However, the tests reveal some inaccuracies:

1.  **ROI Dimensions:** The logic for determining the ROI width and positioning based on the blue stripe's location is not entirely correct. The initial assumption about the relationship between input width, stripe position, and output width needs adjustment. The height is consistently 5.
2.  **Stripe identification**: all columns with *at least one* blue pixel qualify
    the original program.
3.  **Output values:** The output grid should only contain azure (8) where the input grid was blue (1), and white (0) everywhere else within the ROI.

The strategy to resolve these issues involves:

*   **Precise ROI Calculation:** Re-examining the examples to derive a more accurate rule for determining the output grid's width and the ROI's starting column.
*   **Color Mapping Verification:** Ensuring that the color mapping within the ROI strictly adheres to the blue-to-azure and everything-else-to-white rule.
*   **Edge Case Handling:** if no blue is present.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered via code execution:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output_grid, predicted_output_grid):
    stripe_col = -1
    for j in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
        if np.any(input_grid[:, j] == 1):
            stripe_col = j
            break

    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    expected_height, expected_width = expected_output_grid.shape
    predicted_height, predicted_width = predicted_output_grid.shape

    correct_pixels = np.sum(predicted_output_grid == expected_output_grid)
    total_pixels = predicted_output_grid.size
    accuracy = (correct_pixels / total_pixels) * 100 if total_pixels > 0 else 0.0
    print(f"    Stripe Column: {stripe_col}")
    print(f"    Input Dimensions: {input_height}x{input_width}")
    print(f"    Expected Output Dimensions: {expected_height}x{expected_width}")
    print(f"    Predicted Output Dimensions: {predicted_height}x{predicted_width}")
    print(f"    Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%")

def show_grid(grid, label):
    print(f'    {label}')
    print(grid)

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Blue Stripe:** Scan the input grid to find a vertical stripe of blue (1) pixels. A column qualifies as a blue stripe if it contains *at least one* blue pixel. If no such stripe is found, the output is a grid of the same dimensions as the input, filled entirely with white (0).

2.  **Determine Output Dimensions and ROI:** If a blue stripe is found:
    *   The output grid's height is always 5.
    *   The output grid's width is determined as follows:
        *   If any blue pixel exists in column 1 or column 2, then output width is
            4
        *   If no blue pixels exist in columns 1 or 2, and a blue stripe exists,
            then scan from right to left to find the *first* (rightmost) blue
            pixel, and if found in the last two columns of the input grid, then the width is 4.
        *    Otherwise the width is 5.
    *   The Region of Interest (ROI) starts at a calculated column:
        *  If the width is 5, the ROI starts 2 columns to the left of the
           *leftmost* blue stripe, but clamped to a minimum start of column 0
           and maximum start large enough to include the entire width.
        *  If the width is 4, and the *leftmost* blue pixel is in column 1 or 2, the ROI starts at column 0.
        *  If the width is 4, and the *rightmost* blue pixel is in the last two columns, then start at that position - 3
           

3.  **Color Mapping:** Within the ROI:
    *   Any pixel that is blue (1) in the input grid becomes azure (8) in the output grid.
    *   All other pixels within the ROI become white (0).

4.  **Output:** The resulting `output_grid` is the transformed grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
