Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Non-Background Pixels: Find all pixels in the input grid that are *not* color 0 (black).
2. Preserve Non-Background: Copy these non-background pixels to the output grid.
3. Shrink Frame: The output grid is created by removing the outer layer of pixels from input grid resulting in dimensions of input_dimension - 2.
4. Relative Positioning: Maintain the relative positions of the non-background pixels within the reduced frame.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
