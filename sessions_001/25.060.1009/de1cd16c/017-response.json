There are distinct rectangular regions of blue (1), azure (8), and yellow (4). Within the azure and yellow regions, there are isolated red (2) pixels. The output is a single digit, the number 4. The output seems related to the yellow (4) regions, the red might also be of importance.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
