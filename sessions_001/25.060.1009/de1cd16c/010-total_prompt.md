**output:**

Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels.  It appears to be divided into four quadrants, each dominated by a single color (green, red, and two azure quadrants). There are also a few blue pixels scattered within the larger colored regions. The output is a single digit, '2'. This suggests the transformation might involve counting something within the input grid. Given the prominence of the colors, it's very likely related to the number, position, or arrangement of colored regions or pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 16
      columns: 15
      cells:
        values: [0-9] # Representing colors
        distribution:  Predominantly 3 (green), 2 (red), and 8 (azure), with some 1 (blue)
  - type: quadrants
    properties:
      count: 4
      colors: [green, red, azure, azure]
  - type: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [green, red, azure, blue]
      positions: (row, column) coordinates within the grid
  - type: output
    properties:
      value: 2
      type: integer

relationships:
  - type: quadrant_contains_color
    description: Each quadrant is largely filled with a single color.
  - type: pixel_within_quadrant
    description: Blue pixels are located within different quadrants.
  - type: output_relates_to_input
    description: The output integer (2) likely represents a count derived from the input grid's properties.

actions:
  - type: count
    description:  The transformation involves counting something within the grid.
  - type: identify_region (potentially)
    description: Distinguishing between regions/quadrants may be relevant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Quadrants:** Divide the input grid into four equal quadrants.
2.  **Identify Colors:** Within each quadrant, identify the dominant background color.
3.  **Locate Blue Pixels:** Observe all of the blue pixels.
4. **Count Red Quadrant:** Count the number of blue pixels that are in the red quadrant.
5. **Output Count:** The final output is the number of blue pixels in the red quadrant.

In essence, the program seems to be, "Count the number of blue pixels in the red quadrant."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
