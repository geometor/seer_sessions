Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large, complex grid with various colored regions (represented by numbers). The output is a much smaller grid, seemingly summarizing a specific part of the input. The dominant colors in the input appear to be blue (1), with smaller regions of azure (8), red (2), and green (3). The output grid consists only of blue (1) and green (3). It's important to note where the green object is in the input, as the output appears to focus on this element.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [15, 17]
    elements:
      - color: blue (1)
        shape: large background
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: two small rectangles
      - color: red (2)
        shape: irregular cluster on the left
      - color: green (3)
        shape: cross or plus sign in the bottom-right quadrant
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 5]
    elements:
      - color: blue (1)
      - color: green (3)
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid appears to represent a zoomed-in and simplified view of the green (3) object and its immediate surroundings in the input grid.
  - type: color_filtering
    description: Only colors blue(1) and green(3), present around the green object, are retained in the output. Other colors are removed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Locate the Green Object:** Find the contiguous region of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2. **Define a Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangular area around the green (3) plus sign object, extracting the 3x5 bounding box by getting the min and max coordinates of the green object.
3. **Isolate the Region of Interest:** Create the bounding box
4. **Filter Colors:** Within this region, keep only pixels that are either blue (1) or green (3). Remove all other colors.
5. **Output the Result:** The resulting filtered region, now the same size as the green object's bounding box, is the output grid.

In summary, the transformation isolates the green object, takes the surrounding blue and green elements, and filters out other colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
