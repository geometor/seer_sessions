task: 6d76f813
observations:
  - object: vertical_segment
    description: A contiguous sequence of pixels, starting with a green pixel and followed by any blue pixels directly beneath it.
    properties:
      start_color: 3  # Green
      subsequent_colors: [1] # Blue
      direction: vertical_down
      alignment: same column as the starting green pixel

  - general_rule: |
      The output grid consists of a single column. The top pixel of this column is the green pixel found in the input grid. 
      The rest of the column consists of all the blue pixels located directly below the green pixel in the input grid.
      If there is no green pixel, or if there are other colored pixels, this rule still extracts the vertical segment
      consisting of the green pixel (if exists) stacked on any blue pixels that may be contiguous and beneath it.
