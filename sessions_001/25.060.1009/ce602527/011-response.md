Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, focusing on a report-style analysis:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to identify and center a yellow "plus" shape, filling the background with azure. It works correctly for the first training example but fails on the others. The primary issue is that the code assumes a very specific, single "plus" shape and a fixed output size relative to that plus. The other examples show variations:

*   **Example 2:** Has *two* yellow plus signs of different sizes, and the output focuses on the larger one, but with a different size relationship than example 1
*   **Example 3:** Features a smaller yellow plus sign, and includes some, but not all, of the surrounding gray.

The strategy needs to shift from finding *a* plus sign to finding the *correct* plus sign (potentially based on size or other criteria) and correctly determining the output size and content, possibly including some of the surrounding context (based on background).

**Metrics and Observations**

To get a precise understanding, I'll analyze the provided grids. I'll focus on:

1.  Identifying all objects, their colors, and sizes.
2.  Determining the "target" object in the input (the one seemingly used for the output).
3.  Calculating the relationship between the target object's size and the output grid's size.
4.  Observing the background color in both input and output.
5. compare expected output with the result of the `transform()`

```python
import numpy as np

def grid_to_string(grid):
    return '\n'.join(''.join(str(cell) for cell in row) for row in grid)

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, result_grid):
    input_str = grid_to_string(input_grid)
    expected_str = grid_to_string(expected_output)
    result_str = grid_to_string(result_grid)

    input_objects = find_objects(input_grid)
    expected_objects = find_objects(expected_output)
    result_objects = find_objects(result_grid)

    print(f"Input Grid:\n{input_str}\n")
    print(f"  Objects: {input_objects}\n")
    print(f"Expected Output:\n{expected_str}\n")
    print(f"  Objects: {expected_objects}\n")
    print(f"Result Output:\n{result_str}\n")
    print(f"  Objects: {result_objects}\n")

    #try to find the correct plus sign:
    target = None
    for obj_list in input_objects.get(4,[]):
        h, w = get_plus_extent(obj_list)
        if h == w and h%2 == 1:
            if target is None or h > get_plus_extent(target)[0]:
                target = obj_list

    if target is not None:
        target_h, target_w = get_plus_extent(target)
        print(f"Target Object (Yellow Plus) Height: {target_h}, Width: {target_w}")
        expected_h, expected_w = expected_output.shape
        print(f"Expected Output Height: {expected_h}, Width: {expected_w}")
    else:
        print("No Target Object Found.")

    diff = result_grid == expected_output
    total_pixels = diff.size
    correct_pixels = np.sum(diff)
    accuracy_percentage = (correct_pixels / total_pixels) * 100
    print(f"Prediction Accuracy: {correct_pixels}/{total_pixels} ({accuracy_percentage:.2f}%)")
