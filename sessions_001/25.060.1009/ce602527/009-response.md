Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid filled primarily with the color azure (8). Within this azure background, there are three distinct colored shapes:

1.  A green (3) "plus" shape.
2.  A yellow (4) "plus" shape.
3.  A magenta (6) shape resembling a larger, incomplete square or a thick "L".

The output is a much smaller grid containing only azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels. The arrangement suggests a simplified representation of the yellow "plus" shape from the input. The output grid appears to capture the overall extent and relative position the central yellow shape within the input grid

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: azure (8)
    description: Dominant color filling the entire input grid.
  - id: green_plus
    color: green (3)
    shape: plus
    description: A cross-shaped object.
  - id: yellow_plus
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: plus
    description: A cross-shaped object.
  - id: magenta_shape
    color: magenta (6)
    shape: L-shape/incomplete square
    description: An object with a more complex shape.
  - id: output_shape
    color: [yellow, azure]
    shape: simplified plus
    description: representation of one object from input

actions:
  - type: selection
    target: yellow_plus
    description: The yellow plus shape is selected as the primary object of interest.
  - type: simplification
    target: output_shape
    description: representation of yellow plus with surrounding azure

relationships:
  - spatial: The green, yellow, and magenta shapes are distinct and do not overlap.
  - selection: The output is related to the yellow object.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct colored shapes within the input grid. Disregard the background.
2.  **Select Target:** Select the yellow (4) "plus" shaped object.
3. **Determine Extent:** Find the maximum dimensions of the selected plus shape
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Generate the new output grid of the proper size
5. **Recreate Shape:** place a yellow plus into the center of the output
6. **Fill remainder:** fill the rest of the output with azure

In essence, the transformation isolates and extracts a simplified, minimal representation of the central yellow plus, in its plus shape, and places that in the center of the output. The background is also captured.
