Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, aiming to discern the underlying transformation logic:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The input grids appear to contain multiple, potentially overlapping, objects of different colors. The output grids seem to be a simplified representation, possibly focusing on a specific object or a combination of objects and their relative positions. The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid and varies between examples. It seems the transformation is extracting and condensing specific colored regions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 2D_grid
  elements: pixels
  values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  properties:
    - color
    - position (row, column)
output:
  type: 2D_grid
  elements: pixels
  values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  properties:
    - color
    - position (row, column)
observations:
  - input_grids_contain_multiple_colored_regions: "Different colors are present, forming distinct shapes or regions."
  - output_grids_are_smaller: "The output grid dimensions are smaller than the input grid dimensions."
  - output_grids_retain_some_input_colors: "Colors from the input grid appear in the output grid."
  - output_grid_size_varies: "The size of the output grid is not consistent across all examples."
  - potential_object_extraction: "The output might be a simplified representation of a specific object or combination of objects in the input."
  - object_shapes: "Various shapes exist including the number 5 and a cross (+)."
  - object_relationships: "The shapes overlap."

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Objects:** Examine the input grid and identify the smallest, non-overlapping rectangular region that contains all pixels *not* equal to the most frequent color in the input grid.

2. **Extract Sub-Grid**: Determine the bounding box (top-left and bottom-right coordinates) of all the contiguous non-background colored shapes or objects.

3.  **Create Output:** Construct a new grid containing only the pixels within this smallest bounding box.

4. If two such regions exist next to each other, combine into one.
