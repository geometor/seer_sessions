The input grid appears to contain multiple colored regions, defined by contiguous blocks of pixels with the same value. The output grid seems to represent a highly abstracted or summarized version of the input, retaining only some of the input's colors and potentially reflecting spatial relationships in a simplified way. Specifically, there are areas of blue (1), red (2), green (3) and cyan (8) in the input. The output is a smaller grid composed of red (2) and blue (1) pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
