Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to contain multiple colored regions, defined by contiguous blocks of pixels with the same value. The output grid seems to represent a highly abstracted or summarized version of the input, retaining only some of the input's colors and potentially reflecting spatial relationships in a simplified way. Specifically, there are areas of blue (1), red (2), green (3) and cyan (8) in the input. The output is a smaller grid composed of red (2) and blue (1) pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 17x17
      - colors: [blue, red, green, azure]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - colors: [red, blue]
  - type: region
    properties:
      - name: red_region_input
      - color: red
      - shape: approximately square, with a "hole"
  - type: region
    properties:
      - name: green_region_input
      - color: green
      - shape: irregular, near top right
  - type: region
    properties:
      - name: cyan_region_input
      - color: azure
      - shape: irregular, resembling a stylized "bird" or "plane"
  - type: region
    properties:
      - name: blue_region_input
      - color: blue
      - shape: background, fills most of the grid

  - type: region
    properties:
      - name: red_region_output
      - color: red
      - shape: approximately square, with a "hole"
  - type: region
    properties:
      - name: blue_region_output
      - color: blue
      - shape: fills the "hole"

actions:
  - type: abstraction
    description: The input grid is simplified, retaining some color and shape information.
  - type: selection
    description: Some regions/colors are selected for inclusion in the output.
  - type: transformation
      description: change shape and size of input

relationships:
  - input_grid contains red_region_input, green_region_input, azure_region_input and blue_region_input
  - output_grid contains red_region_output and blue_region_output
  - red_region_output has a similar, simplified, shape to red_region_input.
  - blue_region_output occupies the 'inverse' or 'hole' area within red_region_output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Region:** Locate the contiguous red (value '2') region in the input grid. This region forms a roughly square shape with an internal "hole."

2.  **Abstract the Red Region:** Create a 5x5 grid. Fill this grid with red (value '2') pixels, maintaining the general "square with a hole" shape.

3.  **Identify the inverse shape:** the "hole" in the red square

4.  **Fill the Hole:** Fill the "hole" within the 5x5 red square with blue (value '1') pixels.

5. **Ignore all other colours:** Disregard all other coloured regions in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
