The primary colors involved are white (0), maroon (9), green (3), and blue (1).  The input grid appears to contain distinct regions of maroon pixels against a white background. The output grid introduces new colors (green and blue) and seems to expand or alter the existing maroon regions, as well as adding an outline. The shapes formed bear some resemblance to letters.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
