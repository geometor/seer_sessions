The input grid primarily contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid introduces blue (1) and green (3) pixels, in addition to retaining some of the maroon and white pixels. There's a clear structural change: shapes are being filled or outlined with different colors. It appears as if regions in the original image are either filled with another color, or outlined.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
