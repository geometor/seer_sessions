Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation logic to the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code performs reasonably well on the first example but fails to generalize correctly to the other training examples. The core issues seem to be:

1.  **Overly Specific Flood Fill:** The initial logic aggressively fills *all* white regions connected to the top edge with green, not just the white that is relevant to the changed maroon regions.
2.  **Incorrect Condition for Blue Outline:** The "directly below" condition for the blue outline is too restrictive. The relationship needs to consider the entirety of the green and maroon objects, not just individual pixels.
3. **Missing White Region**: The strategy to find a connected white region to the leftmost maroon object does not always exist.

The strategy for improvement involves:

1.  **Refine Flood Fill:** Instead of flooding all white pixels that touch the top edge of the grid, the flood fill of green color should start from the green pixels and move to the neighboring white pixels.
2.  **Generalized Outline Condition:** Relax the "directly below" blue outline condition. It's likely about a spatial relationship between *objects* (the filled green shape and the remaining maroon shape) rather than a strict pixel-to-pixel adjacency. It should consider the outline for the object below and above.
3. **White Region Condition**: We should eliminate the top border requirement for flood filling.

**Example and Results Analysis**

To get a more detailed report, let's perform `code_execution` to collect the results of the current code.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
