"""
1.  **Identify Maroon Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of maroon (9) pixels.
2.  **Green Fill (Top Region and surround):** Find the top-most maroon region.
    *   Replace all maroon pixels of that region by green pixels.
    *   Find connected white region to the identified maroon region, that also touch the top edge of the grid
    *   Replace pixels in that white region with green.
3.  **Blue Outline (Middle Region):** find the leftmost maroon object.
    * If it is located directly under an object that was colored green, replace that region's white bounding box with blue color.
4.  **Bottom-Right Region**: Keep the bottom-right maroon region unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
