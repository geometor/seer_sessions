            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a strategy for improvement:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core concept: finding maroon squares, outlining them in green, filling the outlines, and placing a blue rectangle. However, the validation revealed a key flaw in determining the placement of the blue rectangle. It consistently chose the *bottom-most* green rectangle. Examples show that the position of the added rectangle should depend on all others.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Rectangle Selection:** Instead of just looking for bottom most, identify *all* green rectangles formed, and place the blue shape based on the properties of the set of all green shapes.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nTo analyze the examples, I'll manually inspect them (since I can't execute code). I'll focus on:\n\n*   Number of maroon squares.\n*   Sizes of maroon squares.\n*   Result of outlining and filling.\n*   Expected position of the blue rectangle vs. actual (in cases of error).\n\nHere's a summary based on manual inspection and the provided results:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Correct. One 2x2 maroon square, outlined and filled to 4x4 green, blue rectangle placed correctly.\n*   **Example 2:** Incorrect. One 3x3 maroon square. Outlined and filled correctly. Blue placed to the right of bottom-most, but should be on *top*.\n*  **Example 3:** Incorrect. Two maroon squares, a 2x2 and 1x1. Outlined and correctly. Blue placed to the right of bottom-most, but there are *two* green regions on bottom.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input:\n    maroon_squares:\n      - location: [5, 0]\n        size: 2x2\n  output:\n    green_rectangles:\n      - location: [4, -1]\n        size: 4x4\n    blue_rectangle:\n      - location: [4, 3]\n        size: 2x6\n        relative_position: \"right of green rectangle\"\n\nexample_2:\n  input:\n    maroon_squares:\n      - location: [2, 3]\n        size: 3x3\n  output:\n    green_rectangles:\n      - location: [1, 2]\n        size: 5x5\n    blue_rectangle:\n        location: [1,7]\n        size: 2x6\n        relative_position: \"right of green\"\n\nexample_3:\n  input:\n    maroon_squares:\n      - location: [6, 0]\n        size: 2x2\n      - location: [3, 4]\n        size: 1x1\n  output:\n    green_rectangles:\n      - location: [5, -1]\n        size: 4x4\n      - location: [2, 3]\n        size: 3x3\n    blue_rectangle:\n      - location: [5,3]\n        size: 6x2\n        relative_position: \"right of bottom-most green, incorrect\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Maroon Squares:** Locate all maroon (9) squares within the input grid.\n2.  **Outline Maroon Squares:** Enclose each maroon square with a one-pixel thick green (3) outline.\n3.  **Fill Green outline:** Convert each outlined green area to be a solid green rectangle with the same extent.\n4. **Find Green Rectangles:** find *all* green rectangles. If no green, return the input.\n5.  **Create Blue Rectangle:**\n    - if *one* green rectangle, blue is 2x6 to the right\n    - if *two* green rectangles, blue is 6x2 and centered horizontally on right edge of green\n    - if more than two, no change (assume)\n6. **Output**: return the modified grid.\n"
