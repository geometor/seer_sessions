Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Maroon Squares:** Locate all 2x2 maroon (9) squares in the input grid. In this case we have two of such squares.

2.  **Outline Maroon Squares:** For each identified maroon square, create a green (3) outline. The green outline replaces the white(0) pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left and right, not diagonally) to the maroon square, and maintains the original dimensions, hence the outline will be inside the grid and will be one pixel thick.

3.  **Create Blue Rectangle:** Create a 2x6 blue (1) rectangle in the center-right portion of the grid. This blue block should start directly adjacent/to the right of the outline of the lower maroon block, spanning vertically six cells down.

4. **Extend Green outline:** expand the green outlines created in step 2, so it become a filled rectangle of the same dimensions.

5.  **Output:** The final output grid combines all these transformations.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the derived code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the maroon squares, outlining them, and adding a blue rectangle. However, the extension of the green outline to a filled rectangle caused issues, the relative positioning of elements needs refinement, and some training cases introduce variations not yet handled.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Clearly distinguish between the initial maroon squares, their green outlines, and the subsequently filled green rectangles.
2.  **Precise Positioning:** Improve the logic for determining the starting position and dimensions of the blue rectangle relative to the *bottom-most* maroon square (or its outline/filled version).
3. **Handle Variations:** Test for edge cases in green expansion and the existance/location of maroon squares.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**
Here's a breakdown of what happened in each example, judging by eye from the images in the notebook:

*   **Example 0 (Correct):** The code correctly identified two maroon squares, outlined them in green, filled the outlines, and placed a blue rectangle to the right of the lower green rectangle.
*   **Example 1 (Incorrect):** only a single maroon square, outline, filled and blue square added correctly.
*   **Example 2 (Incorrect):** No maroon squares, no action taken.
*   **Example 3 (Incorrect):** two maroon blocks but they are 3x3, outline performed, fill performed incorrectly. blue added correctly.
* **Example 4 (Incorrect):** two maroon blocks but they are 1x1, outline performed but becomes a cross, not filled. blue rectangle created even with no filled rectangle.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  maroon_squares:
    description: Squares of maroon color (9) in the input.
    size: Varies (1x1, 2x2, or 3x3 as observed).
    initial_count: 0, 1, or 2
  green_outlines:
    description: Green (3) outlines around the maroon squares.
    thickness: 1 pixel
    relation_to_maroon: Directly adjacent (up, down, left, right).
  green_rectangles:
    description: Filled rectangles formed by expanding the green outlines.
  blue_rectangle:
    description: A blue (1) rectangle.
    height: 6
    width: 2
    relation_to_maroon:  Positioned to the right of the bottom-most filled green rectangle.

actions:
  find_squares: Locates squares of a specified color and size.
  outline: Creates a border of a specified color around a given region.
  fill_rectangle: Fills a rectangular area with a specified color.
  position_relative: Places one object relative to another.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Maroon Squares:** Find all maroon (9) squares in the input grid. Note their size (which can vary).
2.  **Outline Maroon Squares:** Create a green (3) outline, one pixel thick, around each identified maroon square. The outline should be directly adjacent to the maroon square on all four sides (top, bottom, left, right).
3. **Fill Green outline:** Convert each outlined green area to be a solid green rectangle with the same extent.
4.  **Find Bottom-Most Green Rectangle:** Determine the green rectangle that is positioned lowest in the grid. If there are multiple at the same vertical level, no operation. If no green rectangles are found - no operation.
5.  **Create Blue Rectangle:** Create a 2x6 blue (1) rectangle. Position the top-left corner of this rectangle directly to the right of the *bottom-most* green rectangle.
6. **Output**: output the modified grid.

This revised program accounts for the variable size of the maroon squares, clarifies the filling of the outline, and emphasizes the relative positioning of the blue rectangle to the *bottom-most* green rectangle. It includes a check for the absence of green rectangles to handle cases where no maroon squares are found.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
