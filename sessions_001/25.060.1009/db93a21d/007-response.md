Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a strategy for improvement:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the core concept: finding maroon squares, outlining them in green, filling the outlines, and placing a blue rectangle. However, the validation revealed a key flaw in determining the placement of the blue rectangle. It consistently chose the *bottom-most* green rectangle. Examples show that the position of the added rectangle should depend on all others.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Refine Rectangle Selection:** Instead of just looking for bottom most, identify *all* green rectangles formed, and place the blue shape based on the properties of the set of all green shapes.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

To analyze the examples, I'll manually inspect them (since I can't execute code). I'll focus on:

*   Number of maroon squares.
*   Sizes of maroon squares.
*   Result of outlining and filling.
*   Expected position of the blue rectangle vs. actual (in cases of error).

Here's a summary based on manual inspection and the provided results:

*   **Example 1:** Correct. One 2x2 maroon square, outlined and filled to 4x4 green, blue rectangle placed correctly.
*   **Example 2:** Incorrect. One 3x3 maroon square. Outlined and filled correctly. Blue placed to the right of bottom-most, but should be on *top*.
*  **Example 3:** Incorrect. Two maroon squares, a 2x2 and 1x1. Outlined and correctly. Blue placed to the right of bottom-most, but there are *two* green regions on bottom.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    maroon_squares:
      - location: [5, 0]
        size: 2x2
  output:
    green_rectangles:
      - location: [4, -1]
        size: 4x4
    blue_rectangle:
      - location: [4, 3]
        size: 2x6
        relative_position: "right of green rectangle"

example_2:
  input:
    maroon_squares:
      - location: [2, 3]
        size: 3x3
  output:
    green_rectangles:
      - location: [1, 2]
        size: 5x5
    blue_rectangle:
        location: [1,7]
        size: 2x6
        relative_position: "right of green"

example_3:
  input:
    maroon_squares:
      - location: [6, 0]
        size: 2x2
      - location: [3, 4]
        size: 1x1
  output:
    green_rectangles:
      - location: [5, -1]
        size: 4x4
      - location: [2, 3]
        size: 3x3
    blue_rectangle:
      - location: [5,3]
        size: 6x2
        relative_position: "right of bottom-most green, incorrect"
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Maroon Squares:** Locate all maroon (9) squares within the input grid.
2.  **Outline Maroon Squares:** Enclose each maroon square with a one-pixel thick green (3) outline.
3.  **Fill Green outline:** Convert each outlined green area to be a solid green rectangle with the same extent.
4. **Find Green Rectangles:** find *all* green rectangles. If no green, return the input.
5.  **Create Blue Rectangle:**
    - if *one* green rectangle, blue is 2x6 to the right
    - if *two* green rectangles, blue is 6x2 and centered horizontally on right edge of green
    - if more than two, no change (assume)
6. **Output**: return the modified grid.
