facts:
  - observation: Input grid is larger than the output grid.
  - observation: Input grid contains multiple colors (0, 1, 2, 4).
  - observation: Output grid contains only two colors (0 and 3).
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: 9
      width: 4
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      height: 4
      width: 4
      elements: integers (0-9)
  - relationship: output_grid is a transformation of a subsection of input_grid.
  - action: extract_subsection
    description: A subsection is taken from the input grid.
