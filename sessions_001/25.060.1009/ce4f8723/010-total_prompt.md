Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger, multi-colored grid (input) into a smaller, mostly single-colored grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to predominantly feature a single color (green, represented by '3'), with some white (0) pixels. The output grid is significantly smaller in dimensions compared to the input grid. There appears to be a relationship between specific colored regions in the input and the placement of '3's in the output, specifically focusing where non-white colors occur in blocks, while areas with some white get converted to 0 in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is larger than output grid.
  - input_dimensions: 9 x 4 (height x width)
  - output_dimensions: 4 x 4 (height x width)
  - input_colors: [0, 1, 2, 4] (white, blue, red, yellow)
  - output_colors: [0, 3] (white, green)
  - object_property: Input grid contains colored blocks.
  - object_property: output appears to extract sub-grids from the input.
  - action: Replace specific regions in the input based on color clusters.
  - spatial_relationship: The output grid aligns with the top-left corner of the input grid.
  - object_property: Non-white blocks in input may become '3' in the output, while mixes become 0.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Define Output Size:** The output grid is a 4x4 grid.
2.  **Locate Input Sub-Grid:** Consider a 4x4 sub-grid starting from the top-left corner of the input grid.
3.  **Iterate** through the input sub-grid with a 2x2 window and a stride of 1 in each dimension.
4. Within each 2x2 sub-grid
    *  If the whole 2x2 subgrid is non-white pixels, then the output pixel = 3
    *  Else, the output pixel = 0.

In summary, the transformation takes overlapping 2x2 sections of the original image, and maps them to the output grid. The contents of that 2x2 map determine the output pixel value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
