facts:
  - observation: Input grid is larger than output grid.
  - input_dimensions: 9 x 4 (height x width)
  - output_dimensions: 4 x 4 (height x width)
  - input_colors: [0, 1, 2, 4] (white, blue, red, yellow)
  - output_colors: [0, 3] (white, green)
  - object_property: Input grid contains colored blocks.
  - object_property: output appears to extract sub-grids from the input.
  - action: Replace specific regions in the input based on color clusters.
  - spatial_relationship: The output grid aligns with the top-left corner of the input grid.
  - object_property: Non-white blocks in input may become '3' in the output, while mixes become 0.
