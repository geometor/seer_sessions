observations:
  - example_set: training
    objects:
      - input_grid:
          description: A 2D array of pixels representing colors.
          dimensions: Variable (6x6, 10x10, 10x12 in the examples)
          properties:
            - pixels: Integers from 0 to 9, representing colors.
      - output_grid:
          description: A 2D array derived from the input grid.
          dimensions: 4x4
          properties:
            - pixels: Integers, where non-zero values from the corresponding input section are replaced with 3 (green), and 0 remains 0.
    actions:
      - name: ExtractSubsection
        description: A 4x4 subsection is extracted from the top-left corner of the input grid.
      - name: RecolorPixels
        description:  Within the extracted subsection, all non-zero pixel values are changed to 3 (green). Zero values remain unchanged.
    conclusion: The transformation consistently extracts the top-left 4x4 region and recolors non-zero pixels to green.
