Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies a key aspect of the transformation: extracting a portion of the input and recoloring it. However, it makes an incorrect assumption about *which* portion to extract and recolor. The initial code focuses on the top-left 4x4 square. The training results show that this is not always the case. The correct 4x4 section can be located anywhere within the input grid and consists of non-zero pixels. The initial code must be updated to find the correct 4x4 section in the input.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine all input/output pairs to identify consistent properties of the transformed section, paying close attention to color, size and contents of all the input and output grids.
2.  **Identify the correct 4x4 section to extract:** find the source square in the input grid
3. **Refine color mapping:** the transform color rule might change on further review.
4.  **Update the natural language program:** Re-describe the transformation based on the refined understanding.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution results implied from prompt):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 9x9, contains a 4x4 block of non-zero pixels in the top-left corner.
    *   Output: 4x4, all pixels are green (3).
    *   Result: Success. The initial code correctly handles this case.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 9x9, contains a 4x4 block of non-zero pixels surrounded by zeros.
    *   Output: 4x4, all pixels are green (3).
    *   Result: Fail. Initial code extracts the *top-left* 4x4, which contains zeros (white), instead of the non-zero square.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 9x9, contains a 4x4 block of non-zero pixels surrounded by zeros, but not at the top-left.
    *   Output: 4x4, all pixels are green (3).
    *   Result: Fail. Similar to Example 2, the code extracts the wrong 4x4 section.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - type: square
        color: mixed (non-zero)
        size: 4x4
        location: top-left
        content: various non-zero colors
  output:
    size: 4x4
    objects:
      - type: square
        color: green
        size: 4x4
        content: all pixels are green (3)

example_2:
  input:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - type: square
        color: mixed (non-zero)
        size: 4x4
        location: center (surrounded by zeros)
        content: various non-zero values
  output:
     size: 4x4
     objects:
      - type: square
        color: green
        size: 4x4
        content: all pixels are green

example_3:
  input:
    size: 9x9
    objects:
      - type: square
        color: mixed (non-zero)
        size: 4x4
        location: not top-left (surrounded by zeros)
        content: various non-zero values
  output:
    size: 4x4
    objects:
      - type: square
        color: green
        size: 4x4
        content: all pixels are green
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Find the 4x4 Square:** Locate the 4x4 square within the input grid. This square is identified as a contiguous 4x4 block where all pixels have non-zero (non-white) colors. It may be located anywhere in the input.
2.  **Extract:** Extract the pixel data within the located 4x4 square.
3.  **Recolor:** Create a new 4x4 grid. Fill every cell of this new grid with the color green (value 3).
4. **Output:** the result is the new 4 x 4 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
