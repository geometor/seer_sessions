The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified or \"summarized\" version of a section of the input, primarily using just two colors: green (3) and white (0). The input appears to be segmented, with a repeating pattern, and it's a portion of that segment that makes up the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
