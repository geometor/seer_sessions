Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Color Transformations:**
    *   All pixels with color blue (1) are changed to green (3), except where the blue(1) is adjacent to a black(0).
    *   All pixels with color yellow (4) are changed to green (3).
    *   All pixels with color black (0) remain black (0)
2.  **Row Handling:**
    * Any row that is all yellow(4) becomes green(3) and is only included in the final output if it is immediately followed by a row that contains colors other than only 4.
    *   Rows that contain only the color red (2) are removed.
    *   Rows that contains red(2) and black(0) is removed
    *   If the final row is all black(0), remove it.
3. **Output Construction** The output grid is constructed from the transformed rows, excluding rows as specified.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
