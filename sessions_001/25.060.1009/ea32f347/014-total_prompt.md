Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying a vertical line of grey pixels and coloring grey pixels to the left yellow and to the right red. The code successfully implements this logic. However, the other training examples reveal that the transformation rule is more complex and doesn't always involve a vertical grey line. Some examples include color changes, and object identification.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting the specific changes and identifying any consistent patterns or rules. We will pay attention to all colors and structures.
2.  **Gather Metrics**: Use code execution to determine precisely what changes and assumptions do not match.
3.  **Identify Objects and Actions:** Describe the transformations in terms of objects (contiguous regions of the same color), their properties (color, position, shape), and the actions performed on them (color change, movement, etc.).
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, update the natural language program to accurately describe the generalized transformation rule. This will likely involve multiple conditional statements or a more abstract representation of the rule.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** We will repeat this process, using the refined natural language program to guide code modifications, testing against all examples, and further refining the program and code until all training examples are matched correctly.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here, I go through all of the examples and extract some insights. I'll use a mix of visual inspection and, where needed, conceptual code execution to analyze the results. I am skipping the actual code execution at this phase and performing more of a "thought experiment."

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: A vertical grey line exists. Grey pixels to its left are yellow, and to its right are red in the output.
    *   Output: Matches the expected output.
    *   Metrics:
        *   Vertical Grey Line Column: Identified correctly.
        *   Color Changes: Left pixels (yellow), Right pixels (red) - all correct.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: Contains scattered grey pixels, but no continuous vertical line. There is a green object.
    *   Expected Output: There is no grey, the green object stays in place.
    *   Actual Output: All grey pixels become yellow. No changes.
    *   Metrics:
        *   Vertical Grey Line Column: None.
        *   Color Changes: All Grey -> Yellow (incorrect). Should be all grey -> blue

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *    Input: No grey pixels. Two vertical lines of blue and red.
    *    Expected output: No Change.
    *   Actual Output: No Change
    *   Metrics:
        *   Vertical Grey Line: None.
        *   Color changes: None.

    result: correct
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Grey Pixel Transformation:**
    *   IF a vertical line of grey pixels exists:
        *   Change the color of the vertical line pixels to blue.
        *   Change the color of grey pixels to the *left* of the line to yellow.
        *   Change the color of grey pixels to the *right* of the line to red.
    *   ELSE IF there are ANY grey pixels (but no vertical line):
        *   change all grey pixels to blue.
    *    ELSE:
        *   make no change.

2.  **Other color transformations**
    *   No other colors should change.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
