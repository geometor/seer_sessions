<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2720x1360 at 0x7FC253D0F7D0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming grids containing gray (5) pixels into grids with blue (1), yellow (4), and red (2) pixels, while maintaining the original grid's dimensions and background of white (0) pixels. The gray pixels form distinct contiguous shapes, and each of these shapes seems to be replaced by a differently colored shape. The new colored shapes occupy the location of the old shape. There isn't an obvious geometric transformation (rotation, scaling, reflection). The color change is the primary visual change. The replacement color is dependent on the shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: 0  # White
    property: static

  - id: shape_1
    color: 5 # Gray
    property: dynamic
    actions:
      - replaced_by: shape_1_transformed

  - id: shape_1_transformed
    property: derived
    possible_colors: [1, 2, 4] # Blue, Red, Yellow

rules:
  - input_shape_color: 5 #Gray
  - output_shape_colors: [1, 2, 4] #Blue, red, yellow
  - grid_size: maintained
  - color_mapping_by_shape: true
  - shape_position_maintained : true
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous regions (shapes) of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Maintain Background:** Keep all white (0) pixels unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Color Transformation:** For each identified gray shape:
    *   If the grey shape is a vertical line, replace all its pixels with blue (1).
    *   If the grey shape is a horizontal line, replace all its pixels with red (2).
    *   If the grey shape appears as an "L" shape (or can be considered as two perpendicular lines intersecting) - replace its pixels with yellow color (4). The examples do a very good job to help with this.
4.  **Output:** The output grid should have the same dimensions as the input grid, with the gray shapes replaced by corresponding colored lines, and the background unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation maps gray shapes to colored lines based on the overall geometry of the gray shape, replacing all instances of the number '5' in a shape with another number based on the identified object's overall form..

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
