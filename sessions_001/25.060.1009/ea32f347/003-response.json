The input grid contains vertical lines of grey (5) pixels, some extending to adjacent columns. The output grid seems to replace these grey pixels with different colors: blue (1), yellow (4), and red (2). The positioning of the colored lines appears to correspond directly to the grey lines in the input. The colors may have some relationship to the number of adjacent vertical lines.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A vertical line is defined as a contiguous set of grey pixels in a single column.\n2.  **Determine Output Color:** Based on the gray lines. It looks like isolated vertical lines get replaced by blue (1). If the line is next to another line on the right, the left is yellow (4). If a line has another line to it's right and is not the first line, it is red (2).\n3.  **Replace** the grey pixels in each identified vertical line with the color determined in step 2, maintaining the original position and length of the line.\n4.  **Leave** all other pixels (value 0) unchanged.\n\nEssentially, we're recoloring grey vertical lines based on whether there are adjacent gray vertical lines, the color appears related to column position of vertical lines.\n"
