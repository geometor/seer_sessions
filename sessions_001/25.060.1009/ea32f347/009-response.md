Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 10x10 grid. The input grid contains grey (5) pixels arranged in a specific pattern. The output grid maintains the same dimensions but alters the colors of some pixels.  Specifically, some grey pixels become blue (1), some become yellow (4), and some become red (2). The positions of other values, all white (0) remain unchanged. The transformation seems to be a color substitution based on the initial arrangement of the grey pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
        values: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]
        mapping:
          0: white
          1: blue
          2: red
          4: yellow
          5: grey

  - type: pixel_group
    initial_color: grey
    properties:
       - connected: True #Pixels of the same color forming a connected component
       - vertical_segment: True
       - horizontal_segment : True

actions:
  - type: color_change
    conditions:
      - original_color: grey
    results:
       - vertical_segment_color: blue
       - left_horizontal_segment_color: yellow
       - right_horizontal_segment_color: red

relationships:
 - type: spatial
   description: Grey pixels form connected components.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Connected Components:** Find all connected components consisting of grey (5) pixels in the input grid. A connected component is a group of grey pixels that are adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).

2.  **Classify Segments**: Within each connected component, classify the grey pixels into:
    *   A "vertical segment": A contiguous column of grey pixels.
    * "horizontal segments": contiguous rows of grey pixels.

3.   **Apply Color Changes:**
     - Change the color of grey pixels forming part of any length "vertical segment" to blue (1).
     - If the "horizontal segment" is attached on the left side of the vertical segment, change grey pixels to yellow (4).
     - If the "horizontal segment" is attached on the right side of the vertical segment, change grey pixels to red (2).
     - all other values are not changed

4.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid with the new color assignments, preserving the positions of all other (white) pixels.
