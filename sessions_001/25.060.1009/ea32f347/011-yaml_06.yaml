    rules:
      - if: object is vertical_segment
        then: new_color = 1 (blue)
      - if: object is horizontal_segment and relative_position is left
        then: new_color = 4 (yellow)
      - if: object is horizontal_segment and relative_position is right
        then: new_color = 2 (red)
      - if: object is grey_pixels and there is a vertical line of grey pixels
        then: change the color of the vertical line pixels to blue.  Change pixels to the left to yellow.  Change pixels to the right to red.
