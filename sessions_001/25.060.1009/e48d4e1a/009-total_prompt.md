Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Remove Gray: Eliminate all gray (5) pixels from the input grid.

2.  Identify Red Lines: Locate the original positions of the pre-existing vertical and horizontal red (2) lines in the input grid.

3.  Find New Red Lines: Find the new positions of the vertical and horizontal lines in a copy of the grid after removing the gray pixels.

4.  Calculate and Apply Shifts:

    *   Calculate the horizontal and vertical shift for both vertical and horizontal lines by comparing the before and after positions of the lines.
    *   Move the pre-existing lines to the new positions.
5. No change**: If, after removing the gray, there is no change in the grid, do not move any lines.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
