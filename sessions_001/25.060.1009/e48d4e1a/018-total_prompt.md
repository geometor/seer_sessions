Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), magenta (6), and gray (5). The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the magenta (6) pixels, while the white (0) pixels remain largely unchanged. The gray (5) pixels are completely removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    type: grid
    color: white (0)
    property: static

  - id: magenta_shape_input
    type: shape
    color: magenta (6)
    property: dynamic
    initial_state:
      description: A cross shape, with a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting.
      rows: [4, 0-9]
      columns: [6, 0-9]
    final_state:
      description: an L shape, which is a 90-degree counter clockwise rotation of the orignal, minus the center intersection point.
      rows: [7, 0-9]
      columns: [3, 0-9]

  - id: gray_shape
    type: shape
    color: gray (5)
    property: removable
    initial_state:
      rows: [0-2]
      columns: [9]
    final_state: null

actions:
  - type: rotation
    object: magenta_shape_input
    parameters:
      degrees: 90
      direction: counter-clockwise
  - type: removal
    object: gray_shape
  - type: removal
    object: magenta_shape_input
    parameters:
      description: removal of the center intersection point of the initial magenta cross.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize the white background (0), the magenta cross shape (6), and the gray shape(5).

2.  **Remove Gray:** Remove the gray shape(5)

3.  **Rotate Magenta Shape:** Rotate the magenta cross shape 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

4. **Remove Center:** From rotated figure, remove the new intersection point of the vertical and horizontal bars of the rotated cross.
5.  **Output:** The resulting grid consists of the rotated magenta shape minus its central intersection point on the white background.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
