Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), white(0), and gray(5). The input grid contains a cross-shaped structure made of green pixels. There's a single gray pixel in the top right corner of the input. The output grid is similar to the input, but the gray pixel is gone, and the position of the vertical green bar is shifted.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      colors: [0, 3, 5]  # white, green, grey
  - type: shape
    properties:
      name: cross
      color: 3 # green
      components:
        - type: line
          properties:
            orientation: horizontal
            row: 2
        - type: line
          properties:
            orientation: vertical
            column: original_4, shifted_3

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: 5
      location: (0,9) # original

actions:
    - type: delete
      target: grey pixel
    - type: shift
      target: vertical line of the cross
      properties:
        direction: left
        amount: 1

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find a cross shape formed by green (3) pixels. The cross consists of a horizontal line and a vertical line. Also locate single gray pixel (5)
2.  **Delete Object:** Delete the gray (5) pixel.
3.  **Shift vertical line:** Shift the vertical line of the green cross one position to the left.
4.  **Maintain:** Keep the horizontal green line in place.
5.  **Output:** Produce the transformed grid.
