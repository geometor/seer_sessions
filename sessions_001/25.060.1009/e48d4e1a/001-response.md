Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the underlying transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of varying single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The most prominent feature is the presence of lines forming a '+' shape within each grid. The transformation seems to focus on manipulating these '+' shapes, specifically their orientation and position. The gray '5' in the top right corner appears to be irrelevant. There also seems to be a consistent change of the horizontal part of the "+" shape in the output. The columns and rows with colored pixels swap, with a different pattern in where colored pixels appear.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: line_segment
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal or vertical
      - color: varies (2, 4, 6, 3) - red, yellow, magenta, green
      - length: 10 (extends across the entire grid)
  - type: plus_shape
    properties:
     - composed_of: two intersecting line segments
     - intersection: center point of the grid or one row up of center

actions:
  - type: transpose
    description: Swaps rows and columns of certain parts of the grids

relationships:
  - plus_shape: formed by intersection of horizontal and vertical line segments
  - transformation:  The input plus shape's horizontal line is moved, the location depending where the vertical line is

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the '+' shape:** Locate the horizontal and vertical lines that intersect to form a '+' shape in the input grid. Note the color of these line segments.
2. **Identify the center**: find the row an column index where the colored pixels intersect.
3. **Move lines**: The output keeps vertical line and moves the horizontal part to one row before the bottom.
