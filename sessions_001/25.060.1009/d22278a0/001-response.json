The transformation seems to involve replicating and alternating the non-zero digits in the input grid, creating a checkerboard-like pattern in the output, overlaid with solid colored regions based on where original digits were.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Note their values and original (row, column) positions.\n\n2.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** For each non-zero digit:\n    *   Starting from the digit's original row, alternate filling cells with the digit and 0 in that row.\n    *   In the next row, shift the starting point (offset by one column) and repeat the alternating fill, creating a checkerboard.\n    *   Continue this process, shifting the starting offset by one column with each successive row, effectively extending and alternating the digit's presence throughout the grid.\n\n3. **Create Filled Regions** From the original location of each digit in the input grid, create solid rectangular blocks of that color in the output. The blocks extend downwards and to the right.\n    * The start point and direction depends on the relationship between adjacent digits.\n\n4.  **Blank Areas**: All the other elements are filled with zeroes.\n\nIn summary it appears that the core transformation consists of two combined elements: the first element replicates each non-zero digit into a horizontal checkerboard pattern, the second creates filled, colored blocks downwards and right from where each of the original input digits.\n"
