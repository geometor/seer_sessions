The primary colors involved are blue (1), red (2), and azure (8), with white (0) seemingly representing empty space. The input grid contains isolated blue, red, and azure pixels, while the output grid shows patterns of these colors. There appears to be a concept of \"expansion\" or \"filling\" related to the original pixels. The original colored pixels serve as \"seed\" points for growing areas with the same color, stopping when they encounter each other, or existing borders of the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

If we imagine directions of North, South, East, and West.\n    *   The blue pixel at \\[0,0] fills one cell to the East, and two cells down.\n    *   The blue pixel at \\[6,0] fills one cell to the East, one cell to the North, and one cell diagonally to the north-east.\n    *   The red pixel at \\[0,6] fills one cell to the West, two cells down.\n    *  Azure 8 \"expands\" or \"grows\" from the bottom left up and diagonal to the middle of the grid, constrained by other seed fills.\n\nThe above is my best assessment based just on the given information.\n"
