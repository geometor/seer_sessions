1.  **Create a Checkerboard:** Generate a checkerboard pattern on the 12x12 grid, alternating between 3 (green) and 0 (white) cells, starting with 3 (green) in the top left corner. A cell contains a 3, if the sum of its row and col is even, else it is 0.

2.  **Flood Fill Azure (8):** Starting from the initial 8 (azure) cell in the bottom left corner of the input, flood fill outwards. The flood fill should only replace 0 (white) cells. It is blocked by and therefore does not replace, the 3 (green) cells of the checkerboard. The fill extends diagonally.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, capturing the checkerboard creation and the flood fill concept. However, the flood fill implementation has a flaw. It correctly expands in all eight directions (including diagonals), but it will re-add previously expanded cells. The main issue is that previously added cells can be re-added to the queue which prevents termination. By updating the `if` condition to `output_grid[r, c] == 0`, this will be corrected. Additionally, the updated test results provide more insight. The code works as designed for the first example, but fail for the next two examples. The failures stem from differences in grid size. This requires that the natural language and code must account for different grid sizes.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the results, including some metrics I'll calculate using Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    """Calculates metrics comparing the predicted output to the actual output."""

    correct_pixels = np.sum(output_grid == predicted_grid)
    incorrect_pixels = np.sum(output_grid != predicted_grid)
    total_pixels = output_grid.size
    accuracy = correct_pixels / total_pixels if total_pixels > 0 else 0.0

    return {
        'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
        'output_shape': output_grid.shape,
        'predicted_shape': predicted_grid.shape,
        'correct_pixels': correct_pixels,
        'incorrect_pixels': incorrect_pixels,
        'total_pixels': total_pixels,
        'accuracy': accuracy
    }

  """Prints a grid."""
  print(f"--- {label} ---")
  print(grid)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Determine Grid Dimensions:** Get the number of rows and columns of the input grid.

2.  **Create Checkerboard:** Generate a checkerboard pattern on a grid with the same dimensions as the input, alternating between green (3) and white (0) cells. A cell contains a green (3), if the sum of its row and column indices is even, else it is white (0).

3.  **Find Azure Starting Point:** Locate the azure (8) pixel in the input grid.

4.  **Flood Fill Azure:** Starting from the azure (8) pixel, flood fill outwards, replacing only white (0) cells. The flood fill expands with 8-connectivity (including diagonals). The fill is blocked by and therefore does not replace, the green (3) cells of the checkerboard. If a cell is not white (0), then do not expand to its neighbors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
