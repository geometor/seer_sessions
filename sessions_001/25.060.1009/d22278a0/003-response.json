Both grids consist of cells, each containing a single digit (0-9), representing different colors. The input grid appears mostly empty (filled with 0s, or white), with a single blue pixel (1) and a single red pixel (2) at opposite corners. The output grid retains the positions of blue (1) and red (2) in corner, but introduces a pattern:\n\n*   Alternating columns of the respective colors from left to right.\n*    Fill a set of squares with a value, repeating across the grid based\n    on x position.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
