Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Determine Grid Dimensions:** Get the number of rows and columns of the input grid.

2.  **Create Checkerboard:** Generate a checkerboard pattern on a grid with the same dimensions as the input, alternating between green (3) and white (0) cells. A cell contains a green (3), if the sum of its row and column indices is even, else it is white (0).

3.  **Find Azure Starting Point:** Locate the azure (8) pixel in the input grid.

4.  **Flood Fill Azure:** Starting from the azure (8) pixel, flood fill outwards, replacing only white (0) cells. The flood fill expands with 8-connectivity (including diagonals). The fill is blocked by and therefore does not replace, the green (3) cells of the checkerboard. If a cell is not white (0), then do not expand to its neighbors.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the checkerboard pattern and the flood fill concept. However, the flood fill implementation has a flaw: it should *only* replace white (0) cells, and stop expanding from a cell if that cell isn't white. The current implementation adds all valid neighbors to the queue, regardless of whether the current cell was successfully filled (i.e., was white). This can lead to incorrect filling, especially visible in example 2 and 3. The core logic is sound, but the neighbor expansion needs to be conditional on successful cell replacement.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Conditional Neighbor Expansion:** Modify the flood fill algorithm to add neighboring cells to the queue *only if* the current cell was successfully filled with azure (i.e., it was white and is now azure).
2. **Clarify NL Program**

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**

I will use `code_execution` to directly compare the generated output with the expected output, identifying the differences.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
