Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a controlled flood fill, starting from seed pixels (non-white pixels in the input grid). Each seed pixel expands its color outwards, stopping when it encounters another color or the grid boundary. The blue (1) pixel at the top-left expands to the right and down. The red (2) pixel at the top-right expands to the left and down. The azure (8) pixel at the bottom-left expands upwards, to the right, and diagonally.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
