Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Determine Grid Dimensions:** Get the number of rows and columns of the input grid.

2.  **Create Checkerboard:** Generate a checkerboard pattern on a grid with the same dimensions as the input, alternating between green (3) and white (0) cells. A cell contains a green (3), if the sum of its row and column indices is even, else it is white (0).

3.  **Find Azure Starting Point:** Locate the azure (8) pixel in the input grid.

4.  **Flood Fill Azure:** Starting from the azure (8) pixel, flood fill outwards, replacing only white (0) cells. The flood fill expands with 8-connectivity (including diagonals). The fill is blocked by and therefore does not replace, the green (3) cells of the checkerboard. If a cell is not white (0), then do not expand to its neighbors.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
