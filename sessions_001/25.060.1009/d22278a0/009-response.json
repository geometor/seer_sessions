There's a single 3 (green) in the top right corner and an 8 (azure) in the bottom left corner.\n*   The output is a 12x12 grid with a more complex arrangement of 0s (white), 3s (green), and 8s (azure). There's a noticeable checkerboard-like pattern, and areas where the colors appear to have spread or filled in.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A cell contains a 3, if the sum of its row and col is even, else it is 0.\n\n2.  **Flood Fill Azure (8):** Starting from the initial 8 (azure) cell in the bottom left corner of the input, flood fill outwards. The flood fill should only replace 0 (white) cells. It is blocked by and therefore does not replace, the 3 (green) cells of the checkerboard. The fill extends diagonally.\n\nIn essence, a green/white checkerboard is created, and then an azure color starts spreading from the bottom-left, but it's constrained by the green cells of the checkerboard.\n"
