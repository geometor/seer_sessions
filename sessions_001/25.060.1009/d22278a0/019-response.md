Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a color propagation rule, where red and yellow "seed" pixels extend their color vertically in columns to the right. Red goes down, and yellow goes up, stopping at boundaries or other non-white pixels. The initial natural language program was a reasonable starting point but clearly doesn't capture the full transformation logic, as evidenced by the mismatches in the training set results. The primary issue seems to be that propagation of a color should only happen in the same column as the source pixel, not *all* columns to the right. The current code is too aggressive in its propagation.

The strategy to resolve these errors will be to:

1.  **Analyze the Results:** Examine each input/output/predicted output triplet, identify where the prediction deviates from the expected output, and infer the correct behavior. Focus on cases where an object is incorrectly included or excluded in the prediction.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Update observations about objects, their properties, and actions based on the error analysis.
3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately reflect the refined rules, restricting propagation to within the same column.
4.  Use code to create a summary of metrics for the results of the trials.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To help inform revisions to the natural language program, I'll get metrics on the differences between the predicted and expected outputs. I'll pay close attention to:

*   Cases where colors propagate when they shouldn't.
*   Cases where colors fail to propagate when they should.

    """Calculates pixel-wise accuracy between two grids."""
    if predicted_grid.shape != output_grid.shape:
        return 0  # Return 0 if shapes are different
    correct_pixels = np.sum(predicted_grid == output_grid)
    total_pixels = predicted_grid.size
    return correct_pixels / total_pixels if total_pixels > 0 else 0

    changed_pixels = np.sum((predicted_grid != output_grid) & (output_grid !=0) & (predicted_grid != 0))

    return {
        "added_pixels": added_pixels,
        "removed_pixels": removed_pixels,
        "changed_pixels": changed_pixels,
    }

def compare_results(predicted_outputs, train_pairs):
    results = []
    for i, ((input_grid, output_grid), predicted_output) in enumerate(zip(train_pairs, predicted_outputs)):

        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(predicted_output, output_grid)
        difference_metrics = calculate_difference_metrics(predicted_output, output_grid)

        results.append({
            "example": i,
            "accuracy": accuracy,
            "added_pixels": difference_metrics["added_pixels"],
