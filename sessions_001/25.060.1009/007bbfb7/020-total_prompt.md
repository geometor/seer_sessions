```python
"""
The input grid (3x3) is expanded to a 9x9 grid. Each pixel in the input grid is transformed into a 3x3 block in the output grid. If a cell is a red(value = 2) pixel, it gets expanded and all of it's block will be red(value=2). All other area are filled by white cells(value=0)

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_rows, output_cols = input_rows * 3, input_cols * 3
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels 
    for i in range(input_rows):
        for j in range(input_cols):

            value = input_grid[i, j]
            for row_offset in range(3):
                for col_offset in range(3):

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the observation that red pixels in the input grid are expanded into 3x3 red blocks in the output grid, and other areas are filled with white. While this holds true for the first training example, it fails to accurately describe the transformation in the subsequent examples. The core issue is that not only red pixels, but any non-zero pixel gets expanded into its color and not necessarily just white.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair, noting the colors present and how they are expanded.
2.  **Metrics Collection:** Use code execution to programmatically compare input and output grids, focusing on color transformations.
3.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a YAML block to record the observed objects, properties, and actions, with special attention to pixel colors and their expansion.
4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the general rule that *any* pixel in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block of the *same* color in the output grid.

**Metrics Collection and Example Analysis:**

I will perform calculations of pixel color transformations in code cells using
small adhoc testing code.

```python
def compare_grids(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_rows, output_cols = output_grid.shape

    if output_rows != input_rows * 3 or output_cols != input_cols * 3:
        return "Grid size mismatch"

    color_mapping = {}  # input color -> output block color consistency

    for i in range(input_rows):
        for j in range(input_cols):
            input_color = input_grid[i, j]
            output_block_colors = output_grid[i*3:(i+1)*3, j*3:(j+1)*3]
            
            # Check if the output block is uniform in color
            if not np.all(output_block_colors == input_color):
                if input_color not in color_mapping:
                  color_mapping[input_color] = False
            else:
                if input_color not in color_mapping:

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is expanded into a larger grid where each original pixel becomes a 3x3 block. The color of each 3x3 block in the output grid is the same as the color of the corresponding pixel in the input grid. For example, if a pixel in the input grid is blue, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid will be entirely blue. If a pixel is white, its 3x3 block will be white. This applies to all colors and pixels in the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
