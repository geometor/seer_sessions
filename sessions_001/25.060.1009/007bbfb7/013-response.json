            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on a limited understanding from the first training example. It correctly identified the expansion from 3x3 to 9x9 and the focus on yellow pixels. However, the placement logic is incorrect and incomplete, as evidenced by the errors in subsequent examples. The core issue is a misunderstanding of *how* the yellow pixels are replicated and repositioned in the output grid. The current logic seems to be making assumptions that simply are not present in the examples. We must identify a geometrical or positional rule that is more complete.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Visual Inspection and Comparison:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to the *relative* positions of the yellow pixels. Where a yellow pixel exists in the input, carefully not where, and how many, yellow pixels show up in the output.\n2.  **Object Identification**: Instead of the generic notion that yellow pixels move, it may be that subgrids of the input are tiled or mapped to the output grid.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Look for patterns in the replication and placement. Is it a simple mirroring, rotation, translation, or a more complex combination of transformations? Are rows or columns of pixels behaving differently than others?\n4.  **Hypothesis and Test:** Formulate a revised hypothesis (natural language program) based on the observed patterns.\n5.  **Iterative Refinement:** If further errors occur, repeat the process, focusing on the discrepancies.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution will be simulated for this turn):**\n\nTo illustrate the thought process, let's manually analyze the examples (since I cannot directly execute code here):\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Yellow pixel at (0,0).\n    *   Output: Yellow pixels at (0,0), (0,6).\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Yellow pixel at (0,2)\n    *   Output: Yellow pixels at (0,2), (0,8)\n\n*    **Example 3**\n    *    Input: Yellow Pixel at (2,0)\n    *    Output: Yellow Pixels at (2,0), (6,3) and (8,3)\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: Yellow pixel at (2,2)\n    *   Output: Yellow pixels at (2,2), (6,5), (8,5)\n\n* **Example 5**\n    *    Input: yellow pixel at (2,1)\n    *    Output: Yellow pixels at (2,1), (6,4), (8,4)\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: \"Expansion and Replication\"\n  - input_grid_size: 3x3\n  - output_grid_size: 9x9\n  - primary_color: yellow (4)\n  - background_color: white (0)\n  - object_of_interest: yellow_pixels\n  - transformation_type: Replication and strategic placement\n  - replication_factor_row_0: |\n      When a yellow pixel is present in the top row (row 0) of the input,\n      it appears twice in the top row of the output. \n      The left-most position of the yellow pixel in the first row is maintained, and \n      a second appears at the original x coord + 6.\n  - replication_factor_row_2: |\n      When a yellow pixel is present in the bottom row (row 2) of the input,\n      it appears at it's input location, and twice more in the output.\n      Once at output row 6, column = original column + 3, and once at\n      output row 8, column = original column + 3.\n  - row_1_behavior: No yellow pixels in output originate from row 1 of input.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled with white (0).\n2.  **Input Scan:** Examine the 3x3 input grid.\n3.  **Top Row (Row 0) Replication:** If a yellow pixel is found in the top row (index 0) of the input grid at position (0, j), place a yellow pixel in the output grid at (0, j) and at (0, j+6).\n4. **Bottom Row (Row 2) Replication:** If a yellow pixel is found in the bottom row (index 2) of the input grid at position (2, j), place a yellow pixel in the output grid at:\n   - (2, j)\n   - (6, j+3)\n   - (8, j+3)\n5.  **Row 1 Behavior:** Yellow Pixels in Row 1 of the Input Grid are ignored, they are not replicated.\n6.  **Output:** Return the 9x9 output grid.\n"
