Previous Code:
```python
"""
Expand a 3x3 input grid to a 9x9 output grid, replicating and strategically placing yellow (4) pixels based on their positions in the input grid, while leaving the rest of the output grid as white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a 9x9 array filled with white (0)
    output_grid = np.zeros((9, 9), dtype=int)

    input_height = input_grid.shape[0]
    input_width = input_grid.shape[1]

    # Iterate through the input grid to find and replicate yellow pixels
    for i in range(input_height):
        for j in range(input_width):
            if input_grid[i, j] == 4:
                # Copy yellow cells from row 0 to output row 0 and row 2*input_width
                if i == 0:
                    output_grid[i, j] = 4
                    output_grid[i , j + 2* input_width] = 4

                # Copy yellow cell from row 2 to output row 2 and to row 6 and 8

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
