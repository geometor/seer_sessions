objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: [0-9]  # Representing colors

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - cell_values: [0-9]

  - name: colored_pixels
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - colors: [orange(7), yellow(4), red(2), magenta(6)] # Colors observed in the examples.
      - locations: varies per input

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: The input grid is expanded into a 9x9 output grid.
  - name: replicate_pattern
    description: A 3x3 pattern related to the input is repeated across the output grid.
  - name: infill
    description:  Areas within the 9x9 grid, dictated by the color and input location, are filled with the color or the background.

relationships:
  - input_output_grid_size: The output grid is 3x the size of the input grid in both dimensions.
  - color_specific_transformation:  Each color in the input grid has its own unique expansion/infill pattern in the output grid.
  - positional_mapping: The position of a colored pixel in the input grid influences its expanded pattern in the output grid.
