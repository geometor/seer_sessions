Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid.
*   **Output:** A 9x9 grid.
*   **Colors:** Primarily white (0) and yellow (4).
*   **Pattern:** The input grid appears to be replicated and expanded in the output grid, but not in a simple tiling way. The placement of yellow cells seems strategic.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        - [3, 3]  # Input grid
        - [9, 9]  # Output grid
      cells:
        - color: 0  # White
        - color: 4  # Yellow
actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: The input grid is expanded into a larger grid.
  - type: replication
    description: Input grid elements are replicated but modified in the output.
    details: yellow are not simply tiled
relationships:
    input_output_size:
        input_height: 3
        input_width: 3
        output_height: 9
        output_width: 9
    size_change:
        height_multiplier: 3
        width_multiplier: 3
    color_positions:
        input:
          yellow_positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [2,1]]
        output:
            yellow_positions: [[0,0], [0,2], [0,6], [0,8], [2,1], [2,7], [6,3], [6,5], [8,4]]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand Grid:** Take the input 3x3 grid and create a 9x9 output grid (multiply dimensions by 3).

2.  **Replicate with Modification:** Instead of a direct tile copy of input, we consider positions:

    - copy cells [0,0], [0,2] to row 0
    - copy cell [2,1] to row 2
    - the yellow entries in row 0, are copied at the relative x coordinates in row 0
    - the yellow entry in row 2 is copied at the relative x coordinate in row 2
    - row 6, col 3: the relative x coordinates are calculated as (original x + input width), for yellow cells in row 0
    - row 6, col 5: this entry is the center, and corresponds to input [2,1] x value + input width
    - row 8, col 4: last entry is [2,1] with original coordinates x,y + input width.

    In summary:
     - all yellow cells are copied to corresponding x coordinates in output rows 0 and 2
     - original row 0 y=0, gets copied in output to row 0: y * input_width = 0
     - original row 2 y=2, gets copied in output to row 2: y * 1 = 2
     - For row 6, col 3, it copies cells from row 0 to row 2 \* input\_width: 2 \* 3
     - for row 6, col 5, it copies cells from [2,1] which means, it keeps the relative x position
     - last yello pixel at [8,4], from input[2,1]: row = 2 \* input\_width + input\_row, col: input\_width + input\_col

This refined program describes how the specific expansion and placement of yellow pixels occur.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
