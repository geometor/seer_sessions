            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code expands the input grid by a factor of 3 and replicates the input pattern perfectly within the expanded grid. It's a \"pixel-perfect\" replication, which worked beautifully on the first train example, but now we see it fails on the subsequent examples. The core issue is that the provided examples exhibit a pattern which, after close inspection, represents a \"sub-grid expansion within a larger grid\" concept, rather than a complete grid replication. The program perfectly tiles the input, which is incorrect.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\nThe initial approach of simply replicating the entire input grid is too naive. The additional examples highlight a more complex transformation. Instead of replicating the *entire input grid*, the transformation replicates *each individual cell* of the input grid into a 3x3 block within the output grid. The key difference here is understanding the concept of individual element expansion vs global grid expansion.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code_execution where beneficial):**\n\nSince the provided information is already describing results, code execution is not needed to describe results for each example. I am able to perform a direct comparison, which will be more reliable.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input and Output match perfectly.\n*   **Example 2:** Input and Output do *not* match. The output *should* have expanded each individual cell of the input into a 3x3 block in the output.  The current code repeats the entire input grid.\n*   **Example 3:** Input and Output do *not* match. Same issue as example 2.\n*   **Example 4**: Input and output *do not* match.\n*   **Example 5**: Input and output *do not* match.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: |\n  Expand each cell in the input grid into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid.\nobjects:\n  - object_name: input_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - cell_values: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      - role: source data\n  - object_name: output_grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - cell_values: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n      - role: transformed data\n      - dimensions: 3 times the input grid dimensions (both height and width)\n  - object_name: cell\n    properties:\n      - type: single element within a grid\n      - value: integer (0-9, representing a color)\n      - role: basic unit of transformation\nactions:\n  - action_name: expand_cell\n    description: Replicate a single cell from the input grid into a 3x3 block of the same value in the output grid.\n    input: single cell (value)\n    output: 3x3 block in output_grid\n    transformation: |\n      Input cell (i, j) with value 'color' becomes a 3x3 block in the output grid at position (3i, 3j) to (3i+2, 3j+2), where all cells in the block have the value 'color'.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is three times the height and three times the width of the input grid. All cells are initialized to black (value 0).\n\n2.  **Cell Expansion:** For each cell in the input grid:\n    *   Get the color value of the cell.\n    *   In the output grid, locate the 3x3 block of cells corresponding to the input cell's position. The top-left corner of this block will be at coordinates (row \\* 3, column \\* 3), where 'row' and 'column' are the coordinates of the input cell.\n    *   Fill the entire 3x3 block in the output grid with the color value obtained from the input cell.\n\n3. **Output:** return the resulting output grid.\n\nThe core concept is that the expansion happens at the *cell* level, not the grid level. Each individual cell is treated as a unit to be expanded.\n"
