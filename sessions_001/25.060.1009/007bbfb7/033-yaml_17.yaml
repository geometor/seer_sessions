observations:
  - task: 00d62c1b
  - example_set: train
  - objects:
    - input_grid:
        properties:
          - two_dimensional_array: varies in size (3x3, 5x5, 7x7)
          - contains_colors: integers representing colors
    - output_grid:
        properties:
          - two_dimensional_array: dimensions are 3 times the input grid
          - contains_colors: same as corresponding input grid cell, expanded
  - actions:
    - expand:
        input: single pixel from input_grid
        output: 3x3 block of pixels in output_grid, all same color as input pixel
        rule: Each cell is expanded into a 3 by 3 block.
