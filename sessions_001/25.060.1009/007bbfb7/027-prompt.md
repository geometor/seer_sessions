Previous Code:
```python
"""
The 3x3 input grid is replicated nine times to create a 9x9 grid. The replication follows a pattern where the rows of the original grid that are replicated depends on which row the 3x3 block lies. If block is in row 1, replicate the input's first row and zero out the rest. If block is in row 2, replicate the first two rows of the input, and zero out the last row.  If block is in row 3, replicate the full input 3x3.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a 9x9 array filled with 0s.
    output_grid = np.zeros((9, 9), dtype=int)

    # Replicate the input grid based on the block's row index.
    for block_row in range(3):
        for block_col in range(3):
            # Determine how many rows to replicate based on block_row.
            rows_to_replicate = block_row + 1

            # Replicate the specified rows from the input grid.
            for i in range(rows_to_replicate):
                output_grid[block_row * 3 + i, block_col * 3 : block_col * 3 + 3] = input_grid[i]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
