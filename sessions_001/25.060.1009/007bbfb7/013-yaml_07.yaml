observations:
  - task: "Expansion and Replication"
  - input_grid_size: 3x3
  - output_grid_size: 9x9
  - primary_color: yellow (4)
  - background_color: white (0)
  - object_of_interest: yellow_pixels
  - transformation_type: Replication and strategic placement
  - replication_factor_row_0: |
      When a yellow pixel is present in the top row (row 0) of the input,
      it appears twice in the top row of the output. 
      The left-most position of the yellow pixel in the first row is maintained, and 
      a second appears at the original x coord + 6.
  - replication_factor_row_2: |
      When a yellow pixel is present in the bottom row (row 2) of the input,
      it appears at it's input location, and twice more in the output.
      Once at output row 6, column = original column + 3, and once at
      output row 8, column = original column + 3.
  - row_1_behavior: No yellow pixels in output originate from row 1 of input.
