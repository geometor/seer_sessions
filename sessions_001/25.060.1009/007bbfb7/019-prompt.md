Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid (3x3) is expanded to a 9x9 grid. Each pixel in the input grid is transformed into a 3x3 block in the output grid. If a cell is a red(value = 2) pixel, it gets expanded and all of it's block will be red(value=2). All other area are filled by white cells(value=0)

    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_rows, output_cols = input_rows * 3, input_cols * 3

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
