  - action: replication
    description: Red pixels in the input grid are replicated in a specific pattern in the output grid.
    details:
      - "The replication process expands the size of the input to 3x in both dimensions. It makes each original pixel become a block of 3x3."

  - observation: output_pattern
    description: the red areas expand to the size of 3x3 from the original size, with added white pixels in between.
