Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a replication and zeroing-out strategy. It correctly replicates the 3x3 input grid nine times. However, the zeroing-out logic is flawed and doesn't accurately capture the pattern across all training examples. The core issue is that the zeroing-out is based on fixed row indices (e.g., 3:9, 0:3, 6:9, 0:6) relative to the entire 9x9 grid. Instead, it appears the zeroing is applied within each 3x3 replicated block based on the block's position in the overall 3x3 grid of blocks.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Zeroing Logic:** The zeroing logic needs to be relative to each 3x3 block, not the entire 9x9 grid. We need to determine a rule based on the *block's row and column index* (0-2, 0-2) within the larger grid.
2.  **Iterate through Blocks:** The code should iterate through each of the nine 3x3 blocks and apply the zeroing rule based on the block's position.
3.  **Conditional Zeroing:** The zeroing rule will likely be conditional, based on the row and/or column index of the 3x3 block.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand this better, let's manually analyze each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1], [5, 1, 8]]`
    *   Expected Output: `[[1, 8, 8], [8, 8, 1], [5, 1, 8], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]` (Reshaped to 9x9). The output shows only first 3x3 block active and rest are zeros.
    *   Observed from Code: The code replicates the grid and then incorrectly zeroes out parts of the grid.
*  **Example 2:**
    * Input: `[[1, 8, 1], [5, 8, 5], [5, 8, 8]]`
    * Expected Output: output is same replication of input nine times, but row 1 (index 0) replicated, and row 2 and 3 are zeros.
    *   Observed from Code: Similar to example 1, the code replicates but incorrectly zeroes.
* **Example 3:**
    * Input: `[[8, 1, 8], [8, 5, 5], [8, 5, 1]]`
    * Expected output: nine time replication of input, but row 1 and 2 (index 0 and 1) are replicated, row 3 is zeros.
    * Observed from Code: Similar issues as before.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: 3x3 input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: integers (colors)
  - object: 9x9 output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - values: integers (colors)
  - action: replication
    description: The 3x3 input grid is replicated nine times.
  - action: zeroing
    description: Specific rows within each replicated 3x3 block are set to 0 based on the block's position in the 3x3 grid of blocks.
  - observation: block_position
    description: The position (row and column index) of each 3x3 block within the overall 9x9 grid determines which rows are zeroed out.
  - observation: row_zeroing_rule
    description: >
      If the block is in the first row (block index 0), all rows except the first row of the input are zeroed.
      If the block is in the second row (block index 1), the first two rows of the input are replicated, the third row is zeros.
      If the block is in the third row (block index 2), all three rows of input are replicated.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replicate:** Create a 9x9 grid by replicating the 3x3 input grid nine times in a 3x3 arrangement.
2.  **Iterate:** For each of the nine 3x3 blocks within the 9x9 grid:
    *   Determine the block's row index (0, 1, or 2) within the 3x3 grid of blocks.
    *   **Apply Zeroing:**
        *   If the block's row index is 0: Zero out all rows in this block *except* the corresponding rows in the input 3x3 grid. The input will replace the first row of the 3x3 block in output.
        *   If the block's row index is 1: Zero out the third row of the 3x3 block. Replicate the first two rows of the input.
        *   If the block's row index is 2: Keep all three rows of the replicated block as they are.

In essence the rule is that given the row index of blocks, say *r*, replicate *r* rows of the input grid, and zero out the rest within the block.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
