            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a small input grid (3x3) into a larger output grid (9x9). The input grids contain colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9), with a noticeable pattern of some colored pixels against a background of a different color (usually white/0).  The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input, with a 3x3 repetition structure that maintains some relationship to the original input grid, but with alterations and additions. The transformation is color-specific; each color in the input seems to have a unique expanded pattern in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The rules are as follows:\n     - *Orange (7):* If present in input, fill the corresponding 3x3 block in output with orange, except keep the cell that is at same location as background (0) in the input.\n     - *Yellow (4):* If present in the input, Fill output 3x3 block with that same color (4) in the input, in the upper-left and lower-left, lower-right and upper-right cell.\n     - *Red (2):* If present in the input, Fill output 3x3 block with that same color (2) in the input, in upper-left, lower-left and lower-right cells.\n     - *Magenta (6):* If present, it occupies a specific cell within the corresponding 3x3 block in the 9x9 grid, and the rest of the block's cells will remain as background.\n\n3. **Output:** The resulting 9x9 grid is the final output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes each pixel in the input grid, and based on its *color* and *position*, projects a specific 3x3 pattern onto the corresponding section of the output grid. If a pixel is the background color, it doesn't trigger any specific pattern, essentially leaving the corresponding section of the output grid as background as well.\n"
