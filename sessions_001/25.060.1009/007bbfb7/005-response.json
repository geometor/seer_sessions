The input grid consists of two colors: orange (7) and white (0).  The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The core pattern seems to be a 3x3 replication of certain elements, but with modifications based on the original input pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Fill this 3x3 block with orange (7) pixels, except for the top-left pixel, which should be white (0).\n\n3.  **Output:** The resulting 9x9 grid is the output.\n\nIn essence, each pixel in the input is \"blown up\" into a 3x3 subgrid in the output. White pixels become all-white 3x3 blocks, and orange pixels become mostly-orange 3x3 blocks with a white pixel in the top-left corner.\n"
