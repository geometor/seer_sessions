observations:
  - example: 1
    input_rows:
      - "[1, 1, 1]"
      - "[1, 1, 1]"
      - "[1, 1, 1]"
    output_description: |
      The 9x9 output grid replicates the input rows in a pattern.
      First three rows: input row 1 repeated.
      Next three rows: input rows 1 and 2 repeated.
      Final three rows: all input rows repeated.
    result: "success"
  - example: 2
    input_rows:
      - "[2, 2, 8]"
      - "[2, 2, 8]"
      - "[2, 2, 8]"
    output_description: |
      Replication pattern as in Example 1, using different colors.
    result: "success"
  - example: 3
    input_rows:
      - "[0, 7, 7]"
      - "[0, 7, 7]"
      - "[0, 7, 7]"
    output_description: |
       Replication pattern consistent with previous examples.
    result: "success"

general_rule: |
  The transformation replicates rows of the 3x3 input grid to form a 9x9 output grid.
  The first three rows of the output replicate the first row of the input three times across.
  The next three rows of the output replicate the first two rows of the input.
  The final three rows replicate all three rows of the input.
