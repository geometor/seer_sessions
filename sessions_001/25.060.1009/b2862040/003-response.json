            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program and observations accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a reasonable hypothesis, focusing on connected blue pixels. However, the test results reveal that this hypothesis is incomplete. While it correctly handles some cases, it fails to capture the full transformation rule, as evidenced by discrepancies in multiple examples. The core issue seems to be a too-narrow definition of \"connectivity.\" It only considers direct horizontal and vertical adjacency, while the actual rule likely involves a broader concept of object grouping, maybe related to diagonal adjacency or some other, larger structure that allows more than one shape.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all input/output pairs, paying close attention to the *differences* between the predicted output (generated by the current code) and the expected output.\n2.  **Expand Connectivity:** Consider diagonal adjacency in addition to horizontal and vertical.\n3.  **Identify All Objects:** Enumerate the objects and the actions performed on them.\n4.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the re-examination, update the natural language program to accurately and completely describe the transformation rule, which should address issues like shape-based grouping.\n5.  **Update Facts:** Document any newly found properties, features, and behaviors as facts to be used in the next code generation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo gather precise metrics, I'll use a `code_execution` block to compare the input, expected output, and actual output (from running the `transform` function). This will provide counts of correct pixels, incorrect pixels, and pixel value distributions.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(task_examples, transform_function):\n    results = []\n    for example in task_examples:\n        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])\n        expected_output = np.array(example['output'])\n        actual_output = transform_function(input_grid)\n\n        correct_pixels = np.sum(actual_output == expected_output)\n        incorrect_pixels = np.sum(actual_output != expected_output)\n        total_pixels = input_grid.size\n\n        input_values, input_counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)\n        expected_values, expected_counts = np.unique(expected_output, return_counts=True)\n        actual_values, actual_counts = np.unique(actual_output, return_counts=True)\n\n        results.append({\n            'example_id': example.get('id', 'N/A'),\n            'correct_pixels': int(correct_pixels),\n            'incorrect_pixels': int(incorrect_pixels),\n            'total_pixels': int(total_pixels),\n            'accuracy': float(correct_pixels / total_pixels),\n            'input_value_counts': dict(zip(map(int, input_values), map(int, input_counts))),\n            'expected_value_counts': dict(zip(map(int, expected_values), map(int, expected_counts))),\n            'actual_value_counts': dict(zip(map(int, actual_values), map(int, actual_counts))),\n            'input_grid': input_grid.tolist(),\n            'expected_output': expected_output.tolist(),\n            'actual_output': actual_output.tolist()\n        })\n    return results\n\n\ntask_examples = [\n    {'input': [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]], 'output': [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]},\n    {'input': [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]], 'output': [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]},\n    {'input': [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]], 'output': [[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]]}\n]\n\nanalysis = analyze_results(task_examples, transform)\nfor result in analysis:\n    print(f\"Example ID: {result['example_id']}\")\n    print(f\"  Accuracy: {result['accuracy']:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"  Correct Pixels: {result['correct_pixels']} / {result['total_pixels']}\")\n    print(f\"  Incorrect Pixels: {result['incorrect_pixels']}\")\n    print(f\"  Input Value Counts: {result['input_value_counts']}\")\n    print(f\"  Expected Value Counts: {result['expected_value_counts']}\")\n    print(f\"  Actual Value Counts: {result['actual_value_counts']}\")\n    print(f\"Input:\\n{np.array(result['input_grid'])}\")\n    print(f\"Expected:\\n{np.array(result['expected_output'])}\")\n    print(f\"Actual:\\n{np.array(result['actual_output'])}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n```"
