Previous Code:

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Keep all maroon (9) pixels unchanged.
2. Iterate through all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
3.  A blue pixel becomes azure if and only if it has only maroon neighbors
    (up, down, right, left, diagonals included).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The core idea of identifying blue pixels surrounded by maroon pixels and changing them to azure is correct. However, the provided examples reveal that the initial program is incomplete. The additional tests reveal a more nuanced definition of "surrounded". It appears that the initial hypothesis (all 8 neighbors must be maroon) is too strict. We need to carefully examine the failing cases to understand the exact conditions under which a blue pixel turns azure. The strategy is to analyze the failing examples, and update the natural language program to incorporate a more accurate definition of "surrounded".

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the results. Because the grids are presented visually in previous turns, I will summarize key properties as text, counting, and visual comparisons may be inaccurate or difficult to interpret.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: Has blue pixels surrounded by maroon pixels.
    *   Output: Those blue pixels are changed to azure.
    *   Result: The code works as expected.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    * Input: Blue pixels with neighboring maroons, some edge cases.
    * Expected Output: Blue changes to Azure.
    * Actual Output: Blue does not change.
    * Observation: The initial rule is too strict. Not *all* neighbors must be maroon. Some diagonals may be different.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    * Input: Blue pixels, some of them only have maroon neighbors
    * Expected Output: Some blue pixels become azure.
    * Actual output: No change.
    * Observation: Similar to Example 2, the existing rule doesn't trigger the transformation.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Contains pixels of different colors.
  - name: pixel
    type: integer
    description: Represents a color. Key colors are blue (1), maroon (9), and azure (8).
  - name: neighbors
    type: list
    description: List of the 8 neighbors of a cell

actions:
  - name: identify_blue_pixels
    description: Find all pixels with the value 1 (blue).
  - name: check_neighbors
    description: Determine the color values of the neighboring pixels.
  - name: transform_pixel
    description: Change the pixel's color from blue to azure based on a condition using neighborhood.

conditions:
  - name: maroon_neighborhood
    description: Blue pixels near Maroon pixels are candidates to change.
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Inspect Neighbors:** For each blue pixel, examine its eight neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals).
3.  **Conditional Transformation:** A blue pixel is transformed to azure (8) if *at least one* of its neighboring pixels is maroon (9). The initial all neighbor check is wrong.
4. **Preserve other colors**: All colors other than blue are unchanged.

The most important change is refining condition 3. Not *all* neighbors are required. It's sufficient for at least one neighbor to be maroon.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
