Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are of the same dimensions (11x9). The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are maroon (9), blue (1), and azure (8).  The input grid has two distinct shapes or objects formed by connected pixels of the same color (blue, '1'). The output grid has a modified representation of only some of these objects, a color is changed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: shape1
    color: blue (1)
    type: irregular
    initial_position:  [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)] # coordinates of first object from input
  - id: shape2
    color: blue (1)
    type: cross
    initial_position: [(2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10), (5,7), (6,7)] # coordinates of second object from input
  - id: background
    color: maroon (9)
    type: static

actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: shape1
    from_color: blue (1)
    to_color: azure (8)
    
  - type: preserve
    target: shape2

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: shape1 and shape2 are separated and do not overlap
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains two distinct objects (connected regions of the same color) against a maroon background. One irregular object is formed by blue(1) pixels. A second, "cross-shaped" object is also blue.

2.  **Transform:** The irregular object changes to an azure(8) color. The shape itself does not change.

3.  **Preserve:** The "cross-shaped" object formed by the blue (1) color on the right side of the board is unchanged.

4.  **Output:** The output grid reflects these changes, maintaining the original grid size and background. The changed and unchanged objects, and the background.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
