Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct objects within the input grid. An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color that are not the background color.
2.  **Exactly One Change**: Of all of the objects in the input, *exactly one* will change colors.
3. **New Color**: The changed object will transform to a specific color.
4. **Preserve Unchanged**: The other object (or objects) will not have its color changed.
5. **No Shape Changes**: All objects will retain their input shapes in the output.
6. **Output Grid**: return the modified input as the output.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
