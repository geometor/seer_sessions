facts:
  - observation: |
      The task involves changing the color of exactly one object in the input grid to produce the output grid.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are defined as contiguous regions of pixels with the same color.
      The background color (9) is not considered part of any object.
  - object_selection_rule: |
      The object to be changed is determined by matching size, shape, and position with the output.
      The changed object will have a different color in the output.
  - color_change: |
      The selected object's color changes to a new color.
      The new color is determined by examining the difference between input and expected output.
  - immutability: |
      Objects that are not selected for color change retain their original color and shape.
  - spatial_invariance: |
      The position and shape of all objects remain constant, only the color of one object changes.
  - output_grid: |
      The result is always presented as a modified form of the input grid, with changes to a single object's color.
