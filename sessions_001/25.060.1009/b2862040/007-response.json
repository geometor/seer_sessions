Both grids are of the same dimensions (11x9). The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are maroon (9), blue (1), and azure (8).  The input grid has two distinct shapes or objects formed by connected pixels of the same color (blue, '1'). The output grid has a modified representation of only some of these objects, a color is changed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
