The primary colors observed are maroon (9), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grid appears to have distinct regions of blue (1) pixels embedded within a maroon (9) background. The transformation seems to selectively change some of the blue (1) pixels to azure (8), while leaving other blue and all maroon pixels untouched.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
