Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Block: Observations**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - "Two separate azure (8) objects."
    - "First object: a vertical line of length 2 in the second column."
    - "Second object: a horizontal line of length 2 in the fifth column."
  output_grid:
    - "The azure (8) objects remain unchanged."
    - "A blue (1) pixel appears adjacent to the top of the first azure object."
    - "A blue (1) pixel appears adjacent to the left of the second azure object."
```

**Natural Language Program: Transformation Rule**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) colored objects in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Objects:** Keep these azure objects unchanged in their original positions in the output grid.
3.  **Add Blue Pixel (Object 1):** For the first azure object (vertical line), place a blue (1) pixel directly above the top-most pixel of the azure object. If the topmost pixel is at the top border, add a blue pixel on the same column or row.
4.  **Add Blue Pixel (Object 2):** For the second azure object (horizontal line), place a blue (1) pixel immediately to the left of the left-most pixel of the azure object. If the leftmost pixel is at the left border, add a blue pixel on the same column or row.

**Explanation of the "Story"**

The "story" of this transformation is that we have two distinct azure objects. The transformation rule dictates that these azure objects are preserved, and a blue pixel is added as a marker adjacent to a specific point on each of them. The first object gets a blue pixel on top, and the second object gets a blue pixel on its left side. It is as if we added a handle, an extra color.

This description covers all observed changes and provides a general rule applicable to similar inputs.

```python
"""
The transformation rule preserves two distinct azure (8) objects and adds a blue (1) pixel adjacent to each of them. The first object (vertical line) gets a blue pixel on top, and the second object (horizontal line) gets a blue pixel on its left side.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
