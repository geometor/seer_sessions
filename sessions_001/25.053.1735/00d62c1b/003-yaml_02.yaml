examples:
  - id: 1
    observations: |
      - Two vertical lines of green.
      - Green pixel at (2,2) becomes yellow
      - Green pixel at (3,3) becomes yellow
    metrics:
      pixels_off: 2
  - id: 2
    observations: |
     -  Several "L" shapes, created by green pixels.
     -  Only a few green pixels change to yellow, specifically in two locations at "corners".
    metrics:
      pixels_off: 9
  - id: 3
    observations: |
      - More complex green shapes.
      - changes to yellow appear to be on lower or right sides of chains of green.
    metrics:
      pixels_off: 25
  - id: 4
    observations: |
      - Green pixels form various horizontal and diagonal lines, and some squares.
      - Yellow replacements appear between adjacent, connected green pixels.
    metrics:
      pixels_off: 31
  - id: 5
    observations: |
      - The most complex case, with multiple interacting lines/shapes of green.
      - Many more yellow changes. It's clear single adjacency isn't the rule.
    metrics:
      pixels_off: 87
general_observations:
  - The rule is not simply "any adjacent green becomes yellow".
  - The context of *surrounding* green pixels (and possibly their connections) matters.
  - It looks like pixels on the right or bottom side of a group of green pixels, and those pixels must also be next to another green pixel.
