There's a distinct shape formed by green (3) pixels. The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific location within the green shape and changing a single pixel at that location to yellow (4). The core challenge is figuring out the rule for selecting *which* green pixel becomes yellow.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
