Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies objects in the input grid and replicates them in the output grid with specific shifts. The yellow (4) object remains in its original position. The azure (8) object is replicated twice: once shifted one position to the left, and again shifted two positions to the left, with a slight vertical shift adjustment. The output is constructed by combining these transformations.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying yellow and azure objects and applying specific shifts to the azure object. The tests reveal that this logic doesn't fully generalize to the other training examples. The core issue seems to be an over-specification of the transformation rule, particularly regarding the azure object's movement and the vertical shift logic. The current implementation also misses out some key parts of the transformation and the edge cases.

The strategy to address the errors involves:

1.  **Broaden Object Identification:** Correctly identify all the distinct objects in the grid.

2.  **Simplify Shift Logic:** Remove the complex vertical shift adjustments and focus on the consistent horizontal shifts.

3.  **Generalize the Rule:** Observe patterns across all training examples to form a more universally applicable rule. The code appears to make an incorrect assumption about the vertical line case.

**Metrics and Observations**
Here's a breakdown of each example, predicted output and expected output, the differences, and resulting observations:

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(predicted, expected):
    """Checks if two grids are identical and returns a diff and comments if not."""
    if predicted.shape != expected.shape:
        return False, f"Shapes differ: Predicted {predicted.shape}, Expected {expected.shape}", predicted - expected

    if not np.array_equal(predicted, expected):
        diff = predicted - expected
        return False, "Values differ", diff

    return True, "Grids are identical", None

def find_objects(grid):
    # Find contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels
    objects = []
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)

    def dfs(r, c, color, obj):
        if (r < 0 or r >= grid.shape[0] or c < 0 or c >= grid.shape[1] or
                visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] != color):
            return
        visited[r, c] = True
        obj.append([r, c])
        dfs(r + 1, c, color, obj)
        dfs(r - 1, c, color, obj)
        dfs(r, c + 1, color, obj)
        dfs(r, c - 1, color, obj)

    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:
                obj = []
                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], obj)

**Example 0**

*   Input and Output have yellow (4) and azure (8) objects.
*   The azure object shifts two positions to the left.
*  The predicted output shifts one position to left and also incorrectly two positions to the left and one down.

**Example 1**

*   Input and Output have yellow (4) and azure (8) objects.
*   The azure object shifts three positions to the left.
*   Predicted output shifts correctly.

**Example 2**

*   Input and Output have yellow (4) and azure (8) objects.
*   The azure object shifts three positions to the left.
*   Predicted output shifts one and two to the left - wrong.

**Example 3**

*   Input and Output have yellow (4) and azure (8) objects.
*   The azure object shifts two positions to the left.
*   Predicted output correctly shifts the two positions.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves two distinct objects, colored yellow (4) and azure (8).
  - object_4:
      color: yellow
      behavior: The yellow object remains stationary. Its position in the input grid is the same in the output grid.
  - object_8:
      color: azure
      behavior: |
          The azure object is shifted to the left.  The amount of the shift may
          vary.
  - shift_rule: The amount of left shift is consistent within a given input/output pair, but varies between pairs.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-black pixels (objects) in the input grid. Note their color and position.
2.  **Yellow Object:** The yellow object (color 4) remains in its original position. Copy it directly to the output grid.
3.  **Azure Object:** The azure object (color 8) is shifted horizontally to the left.
4. **Determine Shift:** Count the number of empty spaces between the yellow block and the azure block.
5. **Apply Shift:** Move the entire azure object to the left, maintaining its shape. Place the right most pixel of the azure block one space to the left of the left most pixel of the yellow block.
6.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the stationary yellow object and the shifted azure object. All other cells are black (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
