            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying yellow and azure objects and applying specific shifts to the azure object. The tests reveal that this logic doesn't fully generalize to the other training examples. The core issue seems to be an over-specification of the transformation rule, particularly regarding the azure object's movement and the vertical shift logic. The current implementation also misses out some key parts of the transformation and the edge cases.\n\nThe strategy to address the errors involves:\n\n1.  **Broaden Object Identification:** Correctly identify all the distinct objects in the grid.\n\n2.  **Simplify Shift Logic:** Remove the complex vertical shift adjustments and focus on the consistent horizontal shifts.\n\n3.  **Generalize the Rule:** Observe patterns across all training examples to form a more universally applicable rule. The code appears to make an incorrect assumption about the vertical line case.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\nHere's a breakdown of each example, predicted output and expected output, the differences, and resulting observations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compare_grids(predicted, expected):\n    \"\"\"Checks if two grids are identical and returns a diff and comments if not.\"\"\"\n    if predicted.shape != expected.shape:\n        return False, f\"Shapes differ: Predicted {predicted.shape}, Expected {expected.shape}\", predicted -

observation: |\n      The transformation involves two distinct objects, colored yellow (4) and azure (8).\n  - object_4:\n      color: yellow\n      behavior: The yellow object remains stationary. Its position in the input grid is the same in the output grid.\n  - object_8:\n      color: azure\n      behavior: |\n          The azure object is shifted to the left.  The amount of the shift may\n          vary.\n  - shift_rule: The amount of left shift is consistent within a given input/output pair, but varies between pairs.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-black pixels (objects) in the input grid. Note their color and position.\n2.  **Yellow Object:** The yellow object (color 4) remains in its original position. Copy it directly to the output grid.\n3.  **Azure Object:** The azure object (color 8) is shifted horizontally to the left.\n4. **Determine Shift:** Count the number of empty spaces between the yellow block and the azure block.\n5. **Apply Shift:** Move the entire azure object to the left, maintaining its shape. Place the right most pixel of the azure block one space to the left of the left most pixel of the yellow block.\n6.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the stationary yellow object and the shifted azure object. All other cells are black (0).\n\n"
