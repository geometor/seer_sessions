## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x384 at 0x7C751B13D0D0>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary objects appear to be contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. The transformation seems to involve manipulating these blocks, specifically the azure (8) colored blocks, while the yellow (4) colored block stays unchanged. There's a shift or duplication of the azure blocks.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: block
    color: azure (8)
    initial_positions: [[0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3]]
    final_positions: [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 2], [2,3]]
  - type: block
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_positions: [[3, 3], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
    final_positions:  [[3, 3], [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5], [5, 4]]
    
actions:
  - type: duplication_and_shift
    object: azure block
    details: "The azure block is duplicated and shifted horizontally."

relationships:
    - type: unchanged
      object: yellow block
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color.  We have two key objects: an azure (8) block and a yellow (4) block.

2.  **Yellow Block:** The yellow (4) block remains unchanged in its position and shape between the input and output.

3. **Azure Block:**
    *   Locate original shape consisting of cell: \[0,3], \[1,4], \[1,5], \[2,3]
    *   The shape is duplicated.
    *   One instance is shift to the left by one
    *   One instance is shifted to the left by 2

4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid by placing the transformed/moved azure blocks and the unchanged yellow block.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
