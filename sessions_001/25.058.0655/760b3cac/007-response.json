Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4).  The input grid appears to have two distinct objects or shapes, one formed by azure pixels and the other by yellow pixels. The output grid has a modified azure shape and maintains an unmodified yellow. The azure shape undergoes a transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For every azure pixel at grid location \\[row, column], check to see if the input grid location \\[row, column+1] equals zero.\n    *   If true, extend the azure shape by changing the pixel color from 0 to 8 for every instance on the azure shape.\n\n3.  **Yellow Shape Preservation:** The yellow shape remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Output construction:** Output the updated shape locations.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule is to extend the azure shape to the right by one pixel where possible, while keeping the yellow shape constant.\n"
