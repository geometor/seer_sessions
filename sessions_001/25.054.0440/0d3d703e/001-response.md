Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. Each integer in the input grid corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the color map provided). The transformation seems to involve incrementing each integer by a fixed value.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped from integer value

actions:
  - type: increment
    target: grid elements
    properties:
      - amount: constant

relationships:
  - input elements map to output elements by incrementing.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid where each cell contains a single-digit integer.
2.  **Transformation:** Add 1 to each integer in the input grid.
3.  **Output:** A 3x3 grid where each cell contains the result from step 2. The color of each cell in both input and output grids corresponds to the number.

In essence, the transformation rule is to increment every number in the input grid by 1 to produce the output grid.
