## Example 1

**input:**
```
5 5 0
5 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509888310>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7EB50988AC80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The output is a single-digit integer. The primary colors present in the input grid are gray (5) and white (0). The output is the number 1, colored blue. The input data appears to be a simplified, symbolic representation of a visual scene.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input
    subtype: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements:
      type: integer
      range: [0, 9]
      mapping: |
          0: white
          5: gray
  - type: output
    subtype: scalar
    datatype: integer
    value: 1
    color: blue
  - observation:
    description: "The output is a single digit"
  - observation:
     description: "the input has a patterned arrangement of values"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count the number of distinct colors other than white** present in the input grid.
2. The output will be the color blue and it will equal the number of distinct colors excluding white.

Essentially, the program counts the number of non-white colors in the input grid, and the output number is equal to the final count, presented in color blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
