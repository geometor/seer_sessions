The input grid appears to contain single-digit numbers, each representing a distinct color. The output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input, with each original pixel replicated in a 2x2 block. The output also includes '0' (white) pixels surrounding the expanded input pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
