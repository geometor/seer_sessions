facts:
  - observation: Input grid is a 2x2 matrix of colored pixels.
  - observation: Output grid is a 4x4 matrix of colored pixels.
  - object: InputPixel
    properties:
      color:  variable (1, 2, 3, 8 in the example)
      position: (row, column) in the input grid
  - object: OutputPixel
    properties:
      color: variable (matches corresponding InputPixel or 0)
      position: (row, column) in the output grid
  - action: Replication
    description: Each InputPixel is replicated into a 2x2 block in the output.
  - action: Padding
    description: The replicated blocks are surrounded by '0' (white) pixels.
  - relationship: InputPixel(r, c) maps to OutputPixel(2r-1, 2c-1), OutputPixel(2r-1, 2c), OutputPixel(2r, 2c-1), OutputPixel(2r, 2c).
  - constants:
      padding_color: 0
      replication_factor: 2
