## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
2 1 8
2 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509A68550>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
2 5 5
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509A69A80>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of red (2), blue (1), and azure (8). The output grid retains the red pixels (2) and replaces both the blue and azure pixels with grey (5) pixels. The overall shape and size (3x3) are preserved. The transformation seems to be a color replacement rule, specifically changing blue and azure to grey, conditioned by some criteria that aren't obvious from this single example.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are both 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains colors red (2), blue (1), and azure (8).
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains colors red (2) and grey (5).
  - observation: |
       All red pixels in the input are preserved as red in the output.
  - observation: |
       The single blue pixel at the input grid center is changed to grey.
  - observation: |
       The two azure pixels in the input are changed to grey.
  - relationship: |
      Colors blue (1) and azure (8) in the input are transformed to grey (5) in the output, conditional on their values.
  - relationship: |
      The size and shape of the grid are constants, and are not affected by the transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Red:** Keep all pixels with the value 2 (red) unchanged.
2.  **Recolor to Grey:** Change all pixels that have the value 1 (blue) or 8 (azure) to 5 (grey).
3.  **Grid structure**: The input grid dimensions must equal output grid dimensions.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
