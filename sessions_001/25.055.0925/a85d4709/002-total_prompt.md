## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509BCABF0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509A69BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the value `0` (white) and `5` (gray), while the output grid contains `3` (green), `4` (yellow), and `2` (red). The positions of non-zero values in input seem related to colors in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 3x3 input grid
    elements: integers 0-9
    element_meaning: color_codes
  - type: grid
    description: 3x3 output grid
    elements: integers 0-9
    element_meaning: color_codes
  - type: object
    description: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: "replace input grid cell based on position"
  - type: observation
    description: gray(5) at corner become green (3)
  - type: observation
    description: gray(5) at center become yellow (4)
  - type: observation
    description: white(0) at any position become red(2)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid and an empty 3x3 output grid.
2.  **Corner Rule**: If a cell in the input grid is at a corner position (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, or bottom-right) AND contains grey (5) value, the corresponding cell in the output grid is set to green(3).
3.  **Center Rule:** If a cell in the input grid is at the center position (row 2, column 2) AND contains grey(5), the corresponding cell in the output grid will be assigned the color yellow(4).
4. **Background rule**: if the cell is white(0) in the input grid, then the cell in the output grid will be red(2).
5.  **Else:** No other cells are modified.

In essence, the transformation defines output colors based on position and original value of input grid cells.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
