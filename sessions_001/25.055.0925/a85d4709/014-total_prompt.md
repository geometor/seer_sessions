## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 0 0
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509BCAF80>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509A69BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid has gray (5) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid has red (2) and yellow (4) pixels. The spatial arrangement of pixels seems significant. There appears to be a color replacement happening.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        input: [gray, white]
        output: [red, yellow]
  - transformation: color_change
    details:
      - gray becomes red
      - white becomes yellow in the center, and red otherwise.
  - spatial_relation: center_pixel
    condition: if a white pixel is surrounded by gray pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Replace** each gray pixel with a red (2) pixel in the output grid.
3. **Identify** all white pixels in the input grid.
4. **Check** the center: If input center is white, **Change** to yellow (4)
5. **Change** all other white (0) to red (2).

Alternative Program, simpler:

1. Replace all gray (5) pixels with red (2) pixels.
2. Replace the center white (0) pixel with yellow (4) pixels.
3. Replace all other white (0) pixels with red (2).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
