## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 5 0
0 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB509888A60>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
3 3 3
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7EB5098FD5A0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the digits 0 and 5, while the output grid contains the digits 3 and 4. There's a clear spatial correspondence between the input and output grids. The transformation doesn't seem to involve any complex geometric manipulations like rotations or reflections. Instead, it seems to be a color substitution based on the original color and maybe its location.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: |
  Transforms a 3x3 grid of integers to another 3x3 grid of integers, likely through color substitution.
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer value (0-9)
      location: (row, column) coordinates within the grid
actions:
  - type: substitution
    description: Replaces an input color with a different output color.
    parameters:
       input_color: original color value
       output_color: replacement color value
relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    description: Each pixel in the input grid maps directly to the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
observations:
    input_grid: contains '0' (white) and '5' (gray)
    output_grid: contains '3' (green) and '4' (yellow)
    substitution_rule: '5' becomes '3', and '0' becomes '4'
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid, maintaining the row and column coordinates.
2.  **If** the pixel's value is 0, **replace** it with 4.
3.  **If** the pixel's value is 5, **replace** it with 3.
4.  **Place** the new value in the corresponding row and column of the output grid.

This program describes a simple color-substitution rule. It's deterministic and directly maps input values to output values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
