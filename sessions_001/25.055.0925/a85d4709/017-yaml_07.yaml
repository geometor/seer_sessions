    final_state: remains white, potentially includes diagonally adjacent white pixels
  - name: center_pixel
    color: white(0) -> yellow (4)
    initial_state: located at the center of the grid (if dimensions are odd)
    final_state: becomes yellow

    color: white (0)
    initial_state: Not part of the central white region
    final_state: transformed to red

  - name: gray_to_red
    description: All gray pixels become red.
  - name: center_to_yellow
    description: The center pixel, if white, becomes yellow.
  - name: identify_central_region
    description: >
      Determine the contiguous white region around the center pixel.  This includes
      pixels directly or diagonally adjacent to the center, and potentially extends
      further based on connectivity within the white region.
  - name: other_white_to_red
    description: White pixels outside the central white region become red.
  - name: center_surround_yellow
    description: If there is white around the center, change to Yellow
