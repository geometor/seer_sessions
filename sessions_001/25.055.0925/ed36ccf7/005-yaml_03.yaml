observations:
  - task: "Swap first row and first column"
  - objects:
      - grid: "2D array of color values"
  - properties:
      - dimensions: "rows x columns (can be different)"
      - top_left_color: "The color of the cell at [0, 0]"
      - first_row: "Elements of the first row of the input grid"
      - first_column: "Elements of the first column of the input grid"
  - actions:
      - swap: "Exchange elements between the first row and first column"
      - preserve_top_left: "The top-left cell retains its original color after the swap"
      - copy_row: "Copy the whole first row"
      - copy_column: "copy the whole first column"
  - constraints:
      - rectangular_handling: "The swap should stop at the shortest dimension"
  - notes: "The previous code did not handle cases where col > rows"
