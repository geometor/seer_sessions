example_1:
  input:
    red_block:
      exists: true
      size: 2x2
    gray_pixels:
      count: 3
      positions: 'various'
  output:
    gray_pixels:
      positions: 'top-left, top-right, and bottom-right adjacent to red block'
  transformation:
    rule: 'Gray pixels move to specific positions relative to red block (TL, TR, BR).'

example_2:
  input:
    red_block:
      exists: true
      size: 2x2
    gray_pixels:
        count: 1
        positions: "various"
  output:
      gray_pixels:
        positions: 'top-left adjacent to red block'
  transformation:
      rule: Gray pixels move to the top-left of the red block

example_3:
  input:
    red_block:
        exists: true
        size: 2x2
    gray_pixels:
        count: 1
        positions: 'various'
  output:
    gray_pixels:
        positions: "top-left adjacent to red block"
  transformation:
    rule: Gray pixel moves to top-left corner of red block
