The colors present are white (0), gray (5), and red (2). The primary objects appear to be clusters of gray and red pixels. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, suggesting a transformation based on relative positions of colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The gray pixel will move either horizontally or vertically, not both.\n    *   If a gray pixel lies above or below the red square, there is no horizontal translation.\n    *    If a gray pixel lies to the left or right of the red square, there is no vertical translation.\n\n3.  **Create Output:** Construct the output grid by placing the gray pixels in their new positions and keeping the red cluster in its original position. All other cells remain white (0).\n"
