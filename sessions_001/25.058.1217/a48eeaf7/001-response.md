Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), gray (5), and red (2).  The grids are 10x10. The key difference between the input and output grids appears to be the rearrangement of the gray (5) pixels, seemingly in relation to the position of the red (2) pixels. The gray pixels are moving, but the red pixels remain in place.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_square
    type: shape
    color: red (2)
    description: A 2x2 square made of red pixels.
    properties:
      static: true

  - id: gray_pixels
    type: individual
    color: gray (5)
    description: Single gray pixels.
    properties:
      static: false  # these move

  - id: grid
    type: container
    description: 10x10 grid containing all other objects
    properties:
      height: 10
      width: 10
      background_color: white (0)

actions:
  - name: move_gray_pixel
    agent: gray_pixels
    target: "empty cell adjacent to red_square and each other"
    description: The gray pixels seem to move based on a rule, collecting near the stationary red shape.
    preconditions:
      gray_exists: "gray pixels must exist in input"
      red_exists: "red pixels must exist in input"

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    subject: gray_pixels
    object: red_square
    description:  Gray pixels move to become adjacent to the red square in a chain.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the 2x2 red square and all individual gray pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Determine Target Locations:**
    The gray pixels are filling empty cells.

3. **Gray Pixel Placement**
    The gray pixels collect such that they form a single connected shape, each pixel must have one of the 4 adjacent (top, left, bottom, right) to at least 1 other gray pixel or the red square, diagonally adjacent is not considered connected.

4.  **Output:** Create a new grid where the red square remains in its original position, the gray pixels have moved according to rule #3, and all other cells are white (0).

In summary, the transformation involves rearranging the gray pixels to cluster around the stationary red square, where the gray pixels form one shape, collecting adjacent to one another, including adjacency to the red square.
