facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain red (2), blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      White (0) pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - observation: |
      Some, but not all, blue (1) pixels are changed to red (2).
  - object_types:
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: [white, blue, red]
        - value: [0, 1, 2]
        - coordinates: (row, column)
  - relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
      - type: containment
        description:  A group of adjacent pixels of the same color forms a connected component (object).
  - actions:
      - type: substitution
        description: Blue pixels are selectively replaced with red pixels based on their surrounding context.
  - transformation_context: "The context is likely a combination of shape, neighboring cells, or some hidden property which determines if a `1` cell should be replaced by `2`"
