            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and observations.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it seems to capture some, but not all, of the transformation rules. The errors in the subsequent examples reveal that the logic for handling white pixels adjacent to both blue and red pixels needs improvement. Specifically, the order of copying matters, and the initial attempt to iterate twice has some overlaps that create an incorrect outcome.\n\nThe overall strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input/output/predicted output carefully, noting discrepancies and identifying the specific conditions causing the errors.\n2.  **Refine Conditions:** Improve the conditional checks in the `transform` function, mainly in the sections handling the white pixels and propagation of colors, to correctly implement precedence of red and blue filling.\n3. **Prioritize Red**: It looks like red pixels are placed and should not be overwritten, but blue pixels can be replaced.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including metrics and observations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_metrics(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid):\n    \"\"\"Calculates pixel-wise accuracy, error count, and identifies error locations.\"\"\"\n    correct_pixels = np.sum(output_grid == predicted_output_grid)\n    total_pixels = output_grid.size\n    accuracy = correct_pixels / total_pixels\n    error_count = total_pixels - correct_pixels\n    error_locations = np.where(output_grid != predicted_output_grid)\n    return accuracy, error_count, error_locations\n\ndef analyze_example(example_number, input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid):\n\n    accuracy, error_count, error_locations = calculate_metrics(\n        input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid\n    )\n    print(f\"--- Example {example_number} ---\")\n    print(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Error Count: {error_count}\")\n    print(f\"Error Locations (row, col):\")\n    if error_count >0:\n        for r, c in zip(*error_locations):\n            print(f\"  ({r}, {c}) -
