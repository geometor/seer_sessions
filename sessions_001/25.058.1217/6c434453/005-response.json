A cross is defined as a 3x3 block of pixels where the center pixel and its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) are blue (value 1), and the corner pixels of this 3x3 area can be any color.\n\n2.  **Check Condition:** Iterate through each pair of identified blue crosses. For each pair, determine if they \"share a corner\". Two crosses share a corner if the centers of two crosses are diagonally adjacent, meaning that the absolute difference of their x coordinates is 1 and the absolute difference of their y coordinates is also 1.\n\n3.  **Transform:** If and only if two blue crosses share a corner, replace *both* of the blue crosses with red crosses. A cross is replaced by changing the color of its center pixel and its four arm pixels to red (value 2).\n4. **Otherwise:** Keep the original input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_crosses(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies centers of 3x3 crosses (plus signs) of a specific color in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    cross_centers = []\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(1, rows - 1):\n        for c in range(1, cols - 1):\n            if (grid[r, c] == 1 and\n                grid[r-1, c] == 1 and\n                grid[r+1, c] == 1 and\n                grid[r, c-1] == 1 and\n                grid[r, c+1] == 1):\n                cross_centers.append((r, c))\n    return cross_centers\n\ndef is_corner_shared(center1, center2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two crosses share a corner (centers are diagonally adjacent).\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = center1\n    x2, y2 = center2\n    return abs(x1 - x2) == 1 and abs(y1 - y2) == 1\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by replacing corner-sharing blue crosses with red crosses.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find all blue crosses\n    blue_cross_centers = find_crosses(input_grid)\n\n    # Create a set of centers to be replaced\n    centers_to_replace = set()\n\n    # Check for corner-sharing crosses and mark them for replacement\n    for i, center1 in enumerate(blue_cross_centers):\n        for j, center2 in enumerate(blue_cross_centers):\n            if i != j and is_corner_shared(center1, center2):\n                centers_to_replace.add(center1)\n                centers_to_replace.add(center2)\n\n    # Perform the replacement\n    for r, c in centers_to_replace:\n        output_grid[r, c] = 2\n        output_grid[r-1, c] = 2\n        output_grid[r+1, c] = 2\n        output_grid[r, c-1] = 2\n        output_grid[r, c+1] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
