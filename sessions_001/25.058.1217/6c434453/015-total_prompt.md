Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all contiguous blue (1) regions (objects) in the input grid.
2.  **Locate** two distinct groups:
    * Group 1: the blue shapes in the top left corner
    * Group 2: the three blue lines next to each other on the left
3. **Transform as follows:**
     *  Group 1: shift the blue object down one row and left one column and change the color to red.
     * Group 2: Shift the blue object up one row and to the right one column, change the color to red.
4. All other pixels are unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
