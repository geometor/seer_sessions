<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1340x1330 at 0x741F734C6210>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on discerning the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors, primarily white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of blue (1) pixels with red (2) pixels, and in other cases blue pixels remain unchanged. The shape and arrangement of the blue pixels appear to be crucial, with certain configurations being replaced and others not. There isn't an obvious geometric transformation like rotation or mirroring, but rather a pattern-based substitution.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain red (2), blue (1) and white (0) pixels.
  - observation: |
      White (0) pixels remain unchanged in the output.
  - observation: |
      Some, but not all, blue (1) pixels are changed to red (2).
  - object_types:
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: [white, blue, red]
        - value: [0, 1, 2]
        - coordinates: (row, column)
  - relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
      - type: containment
        description:  A group of adjacent pixels of the same color forms a connected component (object).
  - actions:
      - type: substitution
        description: Blue pixels are selectively replaced with red pixels based on their surrounding context.
  - transformation_context: "The context is likely a combination of shape, neighboring cells, or some hidden property which determines if a `1` cell should be replaced by `2`"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** blue (1) pixels.
3.  **Analyze** if the blue pixel should be replaced using the following rule, with reference to the image `input_file_4.jpeg`
4.  if a blue pixel is part of a 3x3 cross (plus sign shape), and that cross shares a 'corner' with any neighboring cross, then that blue cross should be replaced.
5.  **If** the pixel should be replaced, change its value to red (2).
6.  **Else, Keep** the pixel's original value.
7. **Output Result** return the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
