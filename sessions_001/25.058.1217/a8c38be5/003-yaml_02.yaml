facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input grid of colored pixels.
    properties:
      - width: 14
      - height: 14
      - cell_values: Integers 0-9, representing colors.
  - type: grid
    description: Output grid of colored pixels.
    properties:
      - width: 9
      - height: 9
      - cell_values: Integers 0-9, representing colors.
  - type: object
    description: Contiguous regions of the same color in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer 0-9
      - shape: Irregular, but can be bounded by rectangles.
  - type: transformation
    description: Input grid is condensed into a smaller output grid.
    actions:
      - remove_background: The background color (0) is completely removed.
      - consolidate: Objects of the same color in input are represented, sometimes
        with position and color, in the output. Objects are chosen and placed
        according to some deterministic process.
      - ordering: it appears there is some ordering of objects, like perhaps
        largest or smallest objects, or those that are most centered in the
        input
