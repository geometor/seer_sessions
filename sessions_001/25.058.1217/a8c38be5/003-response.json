The input grid appears to be larger than the output grid. There are distinct colored regions or \"objects\" within the input grid, and these seem to be somehow consolidated or summarized in the output grid. The output grid retains some of the colors from the input, but in a more compact arrangement. The background color of '0' in the input is entirely absent from the output. It appears some objects might be growing to the maximum extent possible given the constraints.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
