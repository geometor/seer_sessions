Here's my breakdown of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on observations, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves a transformation of 2D grids containing numerical values representing colors. The primary change seems to be related to the location and color of specific vertical lines. Gray (5) pixels are transformed in some way to form blue(1) and red(2) vertical lines.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Maintain the line's original x-coordinate (column) and length.\n3.  **Create Red Line:** For each identified gray vertical line, find the bottom of the grid with gray line x, and create a red (2) line segment of two pixels, keeping the same original x-coordinate.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replaces each gray vertical line with a blue vertical line of the same length and position and a red line segment of length=2 at the bottom, keeping x.\n"
