objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: 9
      - height: 9
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: vertical_line_gray
    type: contiguous block of pixels
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - orientation: vertical
      - length: variable
      - position: (x, y) coordinates

  - name: vertical_line_blue
    type: contiguous block of pixels
    properties:
       -color: blue(1)
       -orientation: vertical
       - length: determined by gray line, keeps x position.
       -position: (x,y)

  - name: vertical_line_red
    type: contiguous block of pixels
       - color: red (2)
       - orientation: vertical
       - length: always 2, keep x of gray line.
       - position: (x, y) coordinates, always at the bottom, below the blue.

actions:
  - name: identify_gray_lines
    description: Locate all vertical lines of gray (5) pixels.

  - name: transform_gray_to_blue
    description: Change the color of a gray line to blue (1), maintaining the same vertical position and length.

  - name: transform_gray_to_red
    description: Add red line of length two, keeping x, but set y to bottom of grid, maintaining same x.

relationships:
   - gray lines in input relate to blue and red in output.
