Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value (represented by numbers 0-9).
*   **Colors:** We have white (0), blue (8), green (3), and potentially others, though only these are relevant in this example.
*   **Shapes/Objects:** We see contiguous blocks of the same color, which can be considered objects. Notably, there are green (3) regions and isolated occurrences of blue (8).
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to selectively remove certain pixels. Specifically, all blue (8) pixels are removed, changing the grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - rows: 13
      - columns: 14
      - cells: pixels with color values (0-9)
  - object: pixel_colors
    properties:
      - 0: white
      - 3: green
      - 8: blue
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
        - color_value: 8
        - action: removed
  - object: green_pixels
        - color_value: 3
        - action: unchanged
  - object: white_pixels
        - color_value: 0
        - action: unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Iterate** through each pixel.
3.  **Check** the color value of the pixel.
4. If the color value is 8 (blue), change the pixel's value to 0 (white).
5. If the color value is anything other than 8, do not change the pixel's value.
6. **Output** is the modified grid.
In summary, every blue pixel in the input is changed to a white pixel, other wise, the output is the same as the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
