The most prominent colors are white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5).  The gray row appears to be a static, dividing line. The transformation seems to involve a vertical mirroring or reflection of the colored pixels (blue and red) above and below the gray line, but with some nuanced behavior. Specifically, isolated colored pixels are mirrored, but strings of colored pixels, those which are adjacent, seem to replicate but maintaining the original colors (blue and red in our examples).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This row acts as a mirror/replication line.\n\n2.  **Iterate through the other rows:** For each row *above* the gray row, examine each pixel.\n\n3.  **Mirror isolated colored pixels:**\n    *   If a pixel is blue (1) or red (2), and its adjacent vertical pixels, *within the same region* (above the gray line or below), are white (0), check the corresponding position in its \"reflection row\" determined by the position's distance from the gray row.\n    *   The \"reflection row\" for row `r` above the static gray row at `s` is `s + (s - r)`. The \"reflection row\" for row `r` below the static gray row at `s` is `s - (r - s)`.\n    *   If that corresponding pixel in the mirrored row is white (0) in the input, change it to the same color (1 or 2, correspondingly) as the source pixel.\n\n4.  **Replicate strings of colored pixels**:\n    * If a pixel is blue(1) or red(2) and is adjacent, vertically, to another pixel of the *same color*, copy that entire vertical string of pixels to the region determined by its distance from the gray row.\n    *   The \"reflection row\" for the string of pixels is calculated using the start and end point of the string using the formula in point 3 above.\n\n5.  **Gray Row Preservation:** The gray row remains unchanged during the transformation.\n\nEssentially the input grid is mirrored vertically around the gray row with a special rule, that the strings of adjacent colored pixels do not change, and are copied from one area of the grey row to another.\n"
