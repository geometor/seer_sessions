Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the central gray line:** Locate the horizontal line of gray (5) pixels at row 4 (index 3).
2.  **Iterate the columns.** Iterate through each of the columns.
3.  **Duplicate above and below.** For each colored pixel, going from the grey line to the edges of the grid, duplicate the current color to the output grid. For example, looking at the first column, from the grey line to the top: white, white, red, white -> write to the ouput, starting at the grey line: white, red, white, white. Then repeat for the other side of the grey line.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
