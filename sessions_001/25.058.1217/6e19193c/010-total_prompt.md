Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 10x10 grid. The primary color (object) is maroon (9), with the background being white (0). The input features a cluster of maroon pixels in two distinct shapes. The transformation seems to involve a combination of translation and potentially, reflection of the existing maroon pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: maroon_cluster_1
    type: pixel_cluster
    color: maroon (9)
    initial_position: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)
    shape: L_shape

  - name: maroon_cluster_2
    type: pixel_cluster
    color: maroon (9)
    initial_position: (6,3), (7,3), (7,4)
    shape: L_shape

  - name: background
    type: background
    color: white (0)

actions:
    - type: transformation
      description: mirror and translation
      object: maroon clusters

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    relation: clusters are separated
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Maroon Clusters:** Locate all contiguous blocks (clusters) of maroon (9) pixels. In this specific example, there are two distinct L-shaped clusters.
2. **Mirror Top and Bottom**: Translate all pixels to the opposite position on the opposite axis.
3. **Combine/Overlay**: Merge the translated clusters with the mirrored. If the original cluster has any part on an edge, remove it to maintain grid dimensions.

Essentially, the transformation reflects and translates all instances of the object(maroon color).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
