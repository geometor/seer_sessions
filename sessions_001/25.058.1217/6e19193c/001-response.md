Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the underlying transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of different colors. In the examples, we see white (0), orange (7), and maroon (9).
*   **Objects:** We can consider contiguous blocks of the same color as distinct objects.
*   **Shapes:** The objects appear to be made up by lines, that connect up or down, left or right.
*    **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve scattering or distributing the non-white pixels of each object within the input grid along lines.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: object1
    color: orange (7)
    initial_shape: "L-shape or 2x1 block"
    final_shape: "diagonal line"
  - name: object2
    color: maroon (9)
    initial_shape: "2x2 or L shape block"
    final_shape: "diagonal line/scattered"

actions:
  - type: ScatterOrDistribute
    description: "Pixels of an object in an initial shape or formation will be move individually"

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Input objects maintain will be placed by the center of mass."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid. Consider each of these blocks as a separate object.
2.  **Center of Mass:** Note the original center position of each object with (x, y) coordinates.
3.  **Scatter Pixels:** For each object, take all original pixels and move them.
    *   Move all pixels of the object so they are along a 45-degree line from upper-left to bottom right
    *    Place new pixels on the diagonal in the output, as available
    *   Maintain the original center of the objects.

In simpler terms, the transformation takes each colored block, and "scatters" its pixels into a diagonal line, keeping the relative position the same as the original form.
