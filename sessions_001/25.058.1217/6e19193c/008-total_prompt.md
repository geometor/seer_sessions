Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by mirroring orange pixels across the main diagonal only if other non-orange, non-black pixels exist.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid based on the presence of non-orange (7) and non-black (0) pixels.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)  # Start with a copy to preserve original pixels

    # Check for the presence of other colors
    other_colors_present = np.any((input_grid != 0) & (input_grid != 7))

    # Conditional Mirroring
    if other_colors_present:
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if input_grid[r, c] == 7:
                    output_grid[c, r] = 7  # Mirror across the diagonal

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a simple observation: mirroring orange pixels across the main diagonal if other non-orange, non-black pixels exist. The test results show this is only partially correct and needs significant refinement. The initial hypothesis is too simplistic and doesn't capture the full complexity of the transformation.

Here's the strategy:

1. **Detailed Example Analysis:** I'll use code execution to examine each input/output pair, noting the presence of different colors, shapes, object positions, and how they change. I am particularly interested in where the code did and didn't predict correctly.
2. **Fact Gathering:** I will create a YAML section that describes each of the objects and properties identified.
3. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll create a more precise and comprehensive natural language program that accurately describes the transformation. This will likely involve identifying conditions beyond just the presence of other colors. It may involve detecting specific shapes, object interactions, or spatial relationships.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To ensure accuracy, I'll use the `code_execution` tool to gather information about the input and output grids. I'll focus on:

*   Presence and count of each color.
*   Shapes formed by different colors.
*   Changes in object positions.
*   Where did the first iteration of the transform predict correctly/incorrectly.

I'll start by defining a helper function to extract these features. The results should be plain text suitable for adding to the YAML document.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
