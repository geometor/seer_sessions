Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both 10x10 grids.\n*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of different colors. In the examples, we see white (0), orange (7), and maroon (9).\n*   **Objects:** We can consider contiguous blocks of the same color as distinct objects.\n*   **Shapes:** The objects appear to be made up by lines, that connect up or down, left or right.\n*    **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve scattering or distributing the non-white pixels of each object within the input grid along lines.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
