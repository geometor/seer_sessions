The core operation seems to be an expansion or replication of each pixel in the input grid. The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid are preserved and replicated in the output grid.  The background color '0' (white) appears to act as a sort of \"transparent\" fill, expanding to fill the remainder. The overall structure is expanding each input pixel into a 3x3 block in the output.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
