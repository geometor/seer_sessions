**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small input grid (3x3) into a larger output grid (9x9). The core operation seems to be an expansion or replication of each pixel in the input grid. The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid are preserved and replicated in the output grid.  The background color '0' (white) appears to act as a sort of "transparent" fill, expanding to fill the remainder. The overall structure is expanding each input pixel into a 3x3 block in the output.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      description: Contains the initial pattern of colored pixels.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      description:  Result of expanding the input grid.

  - relation: expansion
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: pixel-wise
      factor: 3x3  # Each input pixel becomes a 3x3 block in the output.
      preservation: color  # The color of each pixel is maintained during expansion.

  - action: fill_background
      agent: system
      properties:
          color: 0 # white

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid (3x3).
2.  For each pixel, determine its color (represented by an integer).
3.  **Create** a 3x3 block in the output grid, starting at the corresponding position (scaled by 3).  For instance, the pixel at (0,0) in the input maps to the top-left corner (0,0) of the output, pixel at (0,1) maps to (0,3), pixel(1,0) maps to (3,0), and so on.
4.  **Fill** this 3x3 block with the color of the corresponding input pixel.
5.  After processing all input pixels, **fill** any remaining empty cells in the output grid with the background color 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
