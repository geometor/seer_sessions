Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Central Red Band:** Examine the input grid to find rows that contain a significant number of red pixels (e.g., more than half). These rows constitute the central red band.
2.  **Identify Key Rows:** Within the red band, locate two distinct types of rows:
    *   **Alternating Pattern Row:** A row with an alternating pattern of red and white pixels.
    *   **Solid Red Row:** A row consisting entirely of red pixels.
3.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  **Replicate with Alternation:** Fill the output grid by alternating between the "Alternating Pattern Row" and the "Solid Red Row". Start with the solid red row, then the alternating pattern. Repeat this alternation for the entire height of the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying a "central red band" and then replicating two specific row types (solid red and alternating red/white) within that band. However, the testing on the full training set reveals that this approach is too narrow. It works for some cases but fails to capture the full range of transformations present in the examples. The core issue is an over-reliance on finding *both* a solid red row and an alternating red/white row. Some examples only have one or the other, and the code doesn't handle these cases robustly. It is also possible there are examples without a red band at all.

The strategy for resolving errors is as follows:

1.  **Broaden Row Selection:** Instead of requiring both a solid red and an alternating row, the code should be more flexible. It should identify *either* a solid red row, *or* an alternating red/white row, *or* handle cases where neither is present.

2.  **Handle Missing Rows:** The code already includes some handling for cases where one or both row types are not found, which is a good start, but we need to ensure the error conditions are generating optimal output.

3.  **Consider Other Patterns:** While the "red band" concept is useful for some examples, it may not be universally applicable. We need to be open to the possibility of other patterns or rules that don't rely on a contiguous red band. The current examples might all involve replication of rows, but future examples might involve more complex spatial transformations.

4.  **Improved Diagnostics**: Generate more specific diagnostic information about each input and generated output.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I need to gather more specific metrics to confirm assumptions.

      unique_colors = np.unique(row)
      if len(unique_colors) == 1:
        row_types.append(f"solid_{unique_colors[0]}")
      elif len(unique_colors) == 2 and (0 in unique_colors) and (2 in unique_colors):
        if np.all(row[::2] == row[0]) and np.all(row[1::2] == row[1]):

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
