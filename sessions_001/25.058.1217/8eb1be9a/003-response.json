Each pixel has a single integer value representing a color. The prominent color is white (0) and azure (8). The azure pixels form distinct horizontal and diagonal lines, and what appears to be a filled rectangle composed of azure lines. The transformation seems to involve a kind of \"pattern replication\" or \"re-drawing\" of the azure (8) pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Lines:** Locate all rows in the input grid that contain azure (8) pixels.\n2.  **Extract Pattern:** Isolate the azure pixels and their relative positions within their containing rows. It extracts the pattern of azure color per each row.\n3.  **Replicate Vertically:** Create a new grid where the extracted azure pattern of each original row is replicated. In other words, take each identified row, copy the columns where the azure pixels exist, and paste them repeating down vertically.\n4. **Stack with Spacers**: Stack the replicated rows with a single blank row on top and a single blank row on bottom.\n\nIn essence, the transformation takes the azure \"drawing\" from the input and replicates it vertically three times with a single blank spacer. The resulting output has the pattern stacked into three sections.\n"
