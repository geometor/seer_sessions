Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Central Red Band:** Examine the input grid to find rows that contain a significant number of red pixels (e.g., more than half). These rows constitute the central red band.
2.  **Identify Key Rows:** Within the red band, locate two distinct types of rows:
    *   **Alternating Pattern Row:** A row with an alternating pattern of red and white pixels.
    *   **Solid Red Row:** A row consisting entirely of red pixels.
3.  **Generate Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  **Replicate with Alternation:** Fill the output grid by alternating between the "Alternating Pattern Row" and the "Solid Red Row". Start with the solid red row, then the alternating pattern. Repeat this alternation for the entire height of the output grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
