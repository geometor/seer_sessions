Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Rows:** Examine each row in the input grid. If a row contains one or more azure (value 8) pixels, it's considered an "azure row".

2.  **Triple Replicate with Spacing:** For *each* identified azure row:
    *   Replicate the entire row, maintaining the exact positions of the azure pixels, and add it to the output grid.
    *   Add a blank row (all 0s) immediately below the replicated row in the output grid.
    *   Replicate the original azure row again.
    *   Add another blank row.
    *   Replicate the original azure row a final time.

3.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the tripled azure rows, each separated by a blank row. Non-azure rows from the input are discarded. The output height will be (number of azure rows * 4) - 1

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
