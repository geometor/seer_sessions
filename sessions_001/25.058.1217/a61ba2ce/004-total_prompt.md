Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains several distinct colored "objects," which appear to be rectangular blocks of uniform color. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, extracting and rearranging these colored blocks. The colors in the output are the same as those in the input, and the relative shapes formed by same-color groups of pixels seems important. Empty areas (value 0, white) in the input grid do not appear in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input_grid
    description: A 13x13 grid of integers (colors).
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: 2x1 (vertical)
        position: (7,2) # (row,col) top-left
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: 2x1(vertical)
        position: (4,1)
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: 2x1 (vertical)
        position: (8,8)
      - color: 3 (green)
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: 2x1(vertical)
        position: (10,3)
  - type: output_grid
    description: A 4x4 grid of integers (colors).
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: 2x1(horizontal)
        position: (0,0)
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: 2x1(horizontal)
        position: (0,2)
      - color: 3 (green)
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: 2x1(horizontal)
        position: (2,0)
       - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: rectangle
        dimensions: 2x1 (horizontal)
        position: (2,2)

  - action: extraction
    description: Colored objects are extracted from the input grid.
  - action: rearrangement
    description: Extracted objects are placed in the output grid, maintaining some semblance of their original clustered vertical layout, but rearranged into horizontal layouts.
  - relationship: color_preservation
    description: Colors of the objects are maintained from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid and identify contiguous rectangular blocks of pixels with the same non-zero color. Treat each of these blocks as a separate object.
2. **Extract Objects:** For each identified object, record its color and dimensions. Discard any surrounding white pixels (value 0).
3. **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an empty output grid (the example provided is 4x4, it is not clear if this should be determined or is constant - more examples would be needed to make a determination).
4. **Arrange Objects:** Place each extracted object within the output grid as 1 x N or Nx1 blocks, where N is the number of non-zero pixels in each object, maintaining the color. Specifically, it appears the objects are rotated to fit within the output and oriented horizontally (1xN).
5. **Order Objects:** It appears from the given example, the order is Azure, Red, Green, and then Blue. More examples are needed to confirm.

The program appears to extract colored rectangular objects from the input grid, convert all shapes to horizontal or vertical bars based on the input, and position them in the output grid, preserving their colors. It seems to ignore white cells in the input grid.

I hypothesize that the dimensions and layout in the output have some relationship to the input, specifically that vertical blocks become horizontal, and the number of non-zero pixels are the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
