Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-black (non-zero) colored pixels in the input grid. Consider each of these blocks as a separate object.

2.  **Discard Background:** Ignore all black (0) pixels.

3. **Rearrange and pack:** Arrange the colored objects into a 2x2 grid and pack each color into its own quadrant. Maintain original colors and shapes. There is a consistent placement:
    - The top-left quadrant contains any blue (1) objects.
    - The top-right quadrant contains any azure (8) objects.
    - The bottom-left quadrant contains any yellow (4) objects
    - The bottom-right quadrant contains any red (2) objects.

4. If two blocks of the same color exist, pack them together in their specific quadrant.

5. If there are no objects for a particular color, fill the quadrant for that color with white(0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
