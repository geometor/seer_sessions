Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (13x13) filled mostly with black (0) pixels.  There are a few distinct colored "objects" within the grid, each composed of contiguous pixels of the same color.  These objects appear to be squares of varying sizes (1x1, 2x2). The colors present are blue (1), azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4).

The output is a much smaller, rectangular grid (4x4). It seems to contain a condensed representation of the colored objects from the input grid. The spatial arrangement of the colors in the output grid is related to but different from the spatial arrangement of the object on the input grid. The white areas of the larger grid seem to be removed entirely.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: blue_object
    color: blue (1)
    shape: rectangle
    initial_size:
      width: 1-2 pixels
      height: 1-2 pixels
  - id: azure_object
    color: azure (8)
    shape: rectangle
    initial_size:
      width: 1-2 pixels
      height: 1-2 pixels
  - id: red_object
    color: red (2)
    shape: rectangle
    initial_size:
      width: 1-2 pixels
      height: 1-2 pixels
  - id: yellow_object
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: rectangle
    initial_size:
        width: 1-2 pixels
        height: 1-2 pixels

actions:
  - type: condense
    description: The input grid is condensed, removing all white (0) pixels.
  - type: rearrange
    description: The colored objects are rearranged into a 2x2 grid, where each color occupies a quadrant

relationships:
  - input_objects:  The blue, azure, red, and yellow objects in the input grid.
  - output_objects: The corresponding colored areas in the output grid.
  - spatial: The relative positions of the colored objects change from input to output.
  - size:  The input grid size is significantly larger than output. The output grid is fixed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-black (non-zero) colored pixels in the input grid. Consider each of these blocks as a separate object.

2.  **Discard Background:** Ignore all black (0) pixels.

3. **Rearrange and pack:** Arrange the colored objects into a 2x2 grid and pack each color into its own quadrant. Maintain original colors and shapes. There is a consistent placement:
    - The top-left quadrant contains any blue (1) objects.
    - The top-right quadrant contains any azure (8) objects.
    - The bottom-left quadrant contains any yellow (4) objects
    - The bottom-right quadrant contains any red (2) objects.

4. If two blocks of the same color exist, pack them together in their specific quadrant.

5. If there are no objects for a particular color, fill the quadrant for that color with white(0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
