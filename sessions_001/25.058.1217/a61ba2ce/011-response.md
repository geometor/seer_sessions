Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a simple rearrangement of colored objects into a 2x2 grid. The subsequent examples reveal that this initial approach is insufficient. The primary issues are:

1.  **Output Size:** The initial program assumes a fixed 4x4 output grid. Some examples demonstrate that the output grid size can vary. It is coupled to the number of unique non-zero colors in each grid.
2.  **Object Handling:** The code correctly identifies contiguous objects.
3. **Quadrant Rule:** The rule works when the colors are present, but the code crashes when asked to pack objects that have a quadrant that is outside of the grid boundaries (e.g. if only 1 or two colors present).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Dynamic Output Size:** Determine the output grid size dynamically based on input. Infer dimensions from the number of unique colors.
2.  **Quadrant handling:** Revisit the quadrant placement logic.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the observed results. I'll use `np.array_equal` for precise comparison.

```python
import numpy as np

def show_grid(grid, label="Grid"):
    print(f"\n{label}:")
    if grid is None:
        print("None")
        return
    for row in grid:
        print(" ".join(str(int(x)) for x in row))

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    if grid1 is None and grid2 is None:
        return True
    if grid1 is None or grid2 is None:
        return False
    return np.array_equal(grid1, grid2)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-black (non-zero) colored pixels in the input grid. Each block is an object.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Size**: Count the *unique* colors of the objects identified in step 1. Let the number of unique object colors be *n*. The output grid will be *k* x *k*, where k is determined as follows:
      * n = 1: k = 1
      * n = 2, 3, or 4: k = 2
      * n > 4: Not handled in this version
3. **Assign Quadrants**: Create a mapping for up to 4 colors for placement into a 2x2 grid. Use this order of precedence: Blue (1), Azure (8), Yellow (4), Red (2).
    - If Blue (1) exists, the top-left quadrant (0,0) represents Blue.
    - If Azure (8) exists, the top-right quadrant represents Azure. If there is only one unique color and it is Azure, its position should be (0, 0).
    - If Yellow (4) exists, the bottom-left quadrant represents Yellow. If there is only one unique color and it is Yellow, its position should be (0, 0).
    - If Red (2) exists, the bottom-right quadrant represents Red. If there is only one unique color and it is Red, its position should be (0, 0).
4.  **Object Placement:** Place each identified object into its designated quadrant based on the color mapping in step 3. The objects should be placed starting at the top-left of their quadrant, maintaining their original shape and size. Objects of the same color that are placed into the same quadrant should be packed together.
5. **Fill Empty Quadrants**: If a quadrant does not have a corresponding object color, leave the quadrant empty (filled with zeros, black).
6. **Handle Single color edge case**: If n=1, the output is 1x1 and is just the single color.
