There are a few distinct colored \"objects\" within the grid, each composed of contiguous pixels of the same color.  These objects appear to be squares of varying sizes (1x1, 2x2). The colors present are blue (1), azure (8), red (2), and yellow (4).\n\nThe output is a much smaller, rectangular grid (4x4). It seems to contain a condensed representation of the colored objects from the input grid. The spatial arrangement of the colors in the output grid is related to but different from the spatial arrangement of the object on the input grid. The white areas of the larger grid seem to be removed entirely.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider each of these blocks as a separate object.\n\n2.  **Discard Background:** Ignore all black (0) pixels.\n\n3. **Rearrange and pack:** Arrange the colored objects into a 2x2 grid and pack each color into its own quadrant. Maintain original colors and shapes. There is a consistent placement:\n    - The top-left quadrant contains any blue (1) objects.\n    - The top-right quadrant contains any azure (8) objects.\n    - The bottom-left quadrant contains any yellow (4) objects\n    - The bottom-right quadrant contains any red (2) objects.\n\n4. If two blocks of the same color exist, pack them together in their specific quadrant.\n\n5. If there are no objects for a particular color, fill the quadrant for that color with white(0).\n\n"
