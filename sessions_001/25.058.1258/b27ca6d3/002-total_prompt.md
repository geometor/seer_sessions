<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2236x1970 at 0x7E120DD8B1B0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements**

The core element appears to be the interaction between red (2) and green (3) pixels. The white (0) pixels serve as a background and don't seem to directly participate in the transformation. The output grids are mostly identical to the input grids, with changes related to where red pixels are located. Green pixels are introduced adjacent to red pixels in specific configurations.

**YAML Block: Facts**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    behavior: "Triggers the appearance of green pixels"
    
  - object: green_pixel
    color: green (3)
    behavior: "Appears adjacent to red pixels based on certain rules."
    
  - object: white_pixel
    color: white (0)
    behavior: "Passive, background element."
    
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: "Green pixels appear adjacent to red pixels, sometimes forming a 3x3 block"

  - transformation:
    type: conditional_addition
    condition: "Presence and arrangement of red pixels"
    action: "Add green pixels to the grid"
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with a value of 2 (red) in the input grid.

2.  **Check Red Surroundings**: Check if some conditions are met to create a green object around.

3.  **Conditional Green Creation:** If a 3x3 block centered on the red pixel will fit within the output bounds and will not intersect or be adjacent to other colors, create a green 3 x 3 object centered on red.

4. **Prioritize green creation**: Iterate first by red pixels, then create green blocks.

5.  **No Other Changes:** All other pixels, including existing white pixels, remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
