"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '2' (red).

2.  **Check Horizontal/Vertical Adjacency:** For each target pixel (red pixel):
    *   Check for three or more horizontally or vertically adjacent red pixels.
    *   If found, change *all* connected red pixels in that group to '3' (green).

3.  **Check Diagonal Adjacency for Isolated Pairs:**
    * Iterate through all of the `red` pixels
    * If there exists two red_pixels, that are diagonally adjacent and they each are not adjacent to a third red pixel that is horizontally or vertically aligned with both, change the color of the upper-right red_pixel to be green.

4. **Leave Unchanged:** Red pixels not matching the above cases stay red.  Non-red pixels are unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the results and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, capturing two primary rules:

1.  Horizontal/Vertical adjacency of three or more red pixels.
2.  Diagonal adjacency of exactly two red pixels.

However, the results across the training set reveal some inconsistencies and missed nuances. The primary issue seems to be an over-application of the diagonal rule.  Specifically, the current code is:
* Finding pairs correctly
* But, it is changing pixels even when one or both have other adjacent red pixels.
* Only changing one of the pixels in the pair to green.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Diagonal Rule:** The natural language program and code need to be much more specific about the conditions for applying the diagonal rule. It's not *any* diagonally adjacent pair, but isolated pairs with no other red neighbors (horizontal or vertical).  We need to check for *exclusivity* of the diagonal relationship.
2.  **Iterative Debugging:** Use the failing examples to step through the code's logic (can use print statements or a debugger) to understand *why* it's making incorrect changes.
3.  **Prioritize H/V Rule:** Ensure that the Horizontal/Vertical rule is correctly implemented and takes precedence. Any pixel that's part of a 3+ H/V group should *not* be considered for the diagonal rule.

**Metrics and Example Analysis (using code execution):**

```python
import numpy as np

def code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, transformed_grid):
    """Analyzes the results and provides metrics."""
    correct = np.array_equal(output_grid, transformed_grid)
    changes_expected = np.sum(input_grid != output_grid)
    changes_made = np.sum(input_grid != transformed_grid)
    correct_changes = np.sum((input_grid != output_grid) & (output_grid == transformed_grid))
    incorrect_changes = np.sum((input_grid == output_grid) & (output_grid != transformed_grid))
    missed_changes = np.sum((input_grid != output_grid) & (output_grid != transformed_grid))

    print(f"Correct Transformation: {correct}")
    print(f"Expected Changes: {changes_expected}")
    print(f"Changes Made: {changes_made}")
    print(f"Correct Changes: {correct_changes}")
    print(f"Incorrect Changes: {incorrect_changes}")
    print(f"Missed Changes: {missed_changes}")
    print("-" * 20)

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      adjacent_pixels: []  # List of adjacent pixel coordinates and colors
      group_size: 1       # Number of connected red pixels (H/V)
      is_isolated_pair: False # True if part of a diagonally adjacent, isolated pair

actions:
  - name: change_color_to_green
    precondition: |
      (red_pixel.group_size >= 3) OR (red_pixel.is_isolated_pair == True)
    postcondition: |
      red_pixel.color = green (3)
      #if red_pixel.group_size >= 3:
      #  all connected pixels color is green
      #else: #isolated pair
      # both pixels in the pair change color
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '2' (red).

2.  **Horizontal/Vertical Group Check:** For each red pixel:
    *   Check for horizontally or vertically adjacent red pixels.
    *   Count the number of *connected* red pixels (including the starting pixel).  "Connected" means reachable by moving horizontally or vertically through other red pixels.
    *   If the count is 3 or more, change the color of *all* connected red pixels in that group to '3' (green).

3.  **Isolated Diagonal Pair Check:** For each red pixel:
    *   Check for diagonally adjacent red pixels.
    *   If a diagonally adjacent red pixel is found, check *both* pixels to see if they have *any* other horizontally or vertically adjacent red neighbors.
    *   If *neither* of the two diagonally adjacent red pixels has any other red neighbors (H/V), change the color of *both* pixels to '3' (green).

4.  **All Other Pixels:**  Pixels not meeting the above conditions remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
