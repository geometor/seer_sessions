Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **For each** red pixel:
    *   **Check for horizontal sequences:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly to the left AND a white (0) pixel directly to the right of the red pixel, forming a `white-red-white` sequence, change the color of *both* white pixels to green (3).
    *   **Check for vertical sequences:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly above AND a white (0) pixel directly below the red pixel, forming a `white-red-white` sequence, change the color of *both* white pixels to green (3).
3.  **All other pixels remain unchanged.** The transformation only affects white pixels that are part of a `white-red-white` sequence centered on a red pixel.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code correctly identify the core concept: changing white pixels to green based on their proximity to red pixels. However, the original description and code only considered *immediate* horizontal and vertical neighbors. The additional training examples reveal that the rule is slightly more nuanced, specifically regarding the extent and directionality of these checks, and that it only applies to white pixels next to red pixels. The provided examples demonstrate perfect matching, which simplifies matters by removing ambiguities.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will meticulously examine each input/output pair, and include an automated set of properties of the objects and relationships within each example. This involves programmatically checking for sequence lengths, directions, and any skipped pixels.

2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will update the `YAML` block with more precise observations, paying close attention to edge cases and exceptions.

3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** I'll rewrite the natural language program to accurately and completely capture the transformation rule, incorporating the new insights. The program will be deterministic and leave no room for misinterpretation.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here, I provide a text description and a YAML block to catalog important object and transformation data.

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **For each** red pixel:
    *   **Check for adjacent white pixels:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly to the left, change it to green (3).
    *   **Check for adjacent white pixels:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly to the right, change it to green (3).
    *   **Check for adjacent white pixels:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly above, change it to green (3).
    *   **Check for adjacent white pixels:** If there's a white (0) pixel directly below, change it to green (3).
3.  **All other pixels remain unchanged.** The transformation only affects white pixels that are immediately adjacent to a red pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
