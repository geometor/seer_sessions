White (0) appears to be the background. Red (2), Blue (8), and Yellow(4) are significant.\n*    **Shapes**: There are colored lines.\n*   **Transformation:** The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid. Specifically, rows containing red pixels and columns containing blue pixels appear to be extended and a yellow pixel appears at their intersection..\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
