**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The primary elements are:

*   **Grid:** The overall 2D array structure.
*   **Cells:** Individual elements within the grid, each holding a color value.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of pixels with same color. In this case the grey(5) pixels.
*   **Colors:** The values within cells, with 0 seemingly representing a background/empty state and 5 representing gray colored object. 1 seems to replace 0s, in a pattern.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of color values.
    dimensions: 9x9 in both examples.

  - type: cell
    description: Individual element within the grid.
    values: [0, 1, 5]

  - type: object
    description: Gray (value 5) pixels are to be considered as objects.

  - type: background
    description: value 0, surrounding objects.

  - type: transformation
    description: >-
      Gray pixels are preserved. A checkerboard pattern of 1s and 0s is created
      around the objects.
    details: >
       The checkerboard pattern seem to emanate around object.
       If there are multiple objects, new patters do not override existing
       patterns
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all gray (value 5) pixels in the input grid. These are treated as fixed objects.

2.  **Create Checkerboard Pattern:**
    * For each grey object do the following.
        * Place the grey color in the output grid at its location.
        * Fill the immediate neighbors (up, down, left and right) that are 0 with the color blue(1).
        * Now, all immediate neigbhors of the pixels that were filled with blue
        are filled with 0, if the current pixel value is 0.

3. The resulting output grid is the same dimension as the input.

Essentially, the transformation preserves the gray "objects" and generates a checkerboard pattern of 1's and 0's *around* and emanating from them, originating from those object locations. New patterns don't override each other.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
