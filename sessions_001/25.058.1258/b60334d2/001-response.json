The primary elements are:\n\n*   **Grid:** The overall 2D array structure.\n*   **Cells:** Individual elements within the grid, each holding a color value.\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of pixels with same color. In this case the grey(5) pixels.\n*   **Colors:** The values within cells, with 0 seemingly representing a background/empty state and 5 representing gray colored object. 1 seems to replace 0s, in a pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

These are treated as fixed objects.\n\n2.  **Create Checkerboard Pattern:**\n    * For each grey object do the following.\n        * Place the grey color in the output grid at its location.\n        * Fill the immediate neighbors (up, down, left and right) that are 0 with the color blue(1).\n        * Now, all immediate neigbhors of the pixels that were filled with blue\n        are filled with 0, if the current pixel value is 0.\n\n3. The resulting output grid is the same dimension as the input.\n\nEssentially, the transformation preserves the gray \"objects\" and generates a checkerboard pattern of 1's and 0's *around* and emanating from them, originating from those object locations. New patterns don't override each other.\n"
