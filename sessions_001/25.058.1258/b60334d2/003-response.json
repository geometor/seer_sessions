The input grid primarily contains '0' (white) pixels, with a few '5' (gray) pixels scattered within. The output grid introduces '1' (blue) pixels alongside the existing '0' and '5' pixels. The placement of the '1' pixels seems directly related to the positions of the '5' pixels. Specifically, the '1' pixels appear to form a cross or plus-sign (+) shape centered on where the '5' pixels were. The input has isolated gray ('5') pixels and the transform creates blue ('1') pixels that are adjacent to the gray pixels. The output grid is the same dimensions (9 x9) as the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
