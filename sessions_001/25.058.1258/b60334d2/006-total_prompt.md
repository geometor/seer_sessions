Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of creating a blue cross centered on each gray pixel. The results show that this approach is partially correct but needs refinement. While the first example works perfectly, the second and third examples reveal discrepancies. The primary issue seems to be that the gray pixel should *always* become blue. The original approach *sometimes* preserves gray pixels - it only keeps the center of the cross gray. The logic should be that the gray pixels get incorporated into the blue cross.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The core assumption about creating a blue cross around gray pixels is valid. However, gray pixels should be *replaced* by the blue, not preserved in all circumstances.
2.  **Refine the Algorithm:** Modify the natural language program to explicitly state that the gray pixels become part of the blue cross, meaning their value changes to blue (1).
3.  **Boundaries:** Ensure handling of gray pixels near boundaries.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand the errors better, let's create reports on each example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
