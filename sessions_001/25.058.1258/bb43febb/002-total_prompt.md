<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1340x1330 at 0x7E120DD8B1B0>Okay, let's analyze this ARC task. Here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.  Both grids contain pixels of different colors, represented by integers. The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve identifying rectangular regions of gray pixels and replacing a sub-region within them with red pixels. The shapes are always rectilinear with the outer shape being grey and inner being red.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integer color codes.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integer color codes.
  - object: gray_rectangle
    type: shape
    description: A rectangular region of contiguous gray (5) pixels within the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: rectangle
  - object: red_rectangle
    type: shape
    description: a rectangle inside the gray rectangle
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - shape: rectangle
  - action: replace_inner
    description: Replaces a portion of the gray rectangle with red pixels, creating the output grid.
    parameters:
      - input: gray_rectangle
      - output: red_rectangle, within the bounds of the input
  - relationship: inner_rectangle
    description: in the output, the original grey rectangle now has an inner red rectangle
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Rectangles:** Scan the input grid to find all distinct rectangular regions composed entirely of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Define Inner Rectangle:** For each identified gray rectangle, define an inner rectangle.
    *   The inner rectangle's edges starts one pixel in from the top and bottom edge of the outer grey rectangle.
    *   The inner rectangles edges start on the same x coordinate as the edges of the outer grey rectangle.
3.  **Recolor Inner Rectangle:** Change the color of all pixels within the inner rectangle to red (2).
4. **Output Grid Creation** Create the output grid. The areas outside of the grey rectangles remain the same. The grey rectangles now have an inner red rectangle as defined in step 2.

In essence, the transformation finds gray rectangles and paints a smaller red rectangle inside each of them, leaving a one-pixel gray border.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
