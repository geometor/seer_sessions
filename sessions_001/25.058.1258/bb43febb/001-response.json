Here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid.  Both grids contain pixels of different colors, represented by integers. The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve identifying rectangular regions of gray pixels and replacing a sub-region within them with red pixels. The shapes are always rectilinear with the outer shape being grey and inner being red.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The areas outside of the grey rectangles remain the same. The grey rectangles now have an inner red rectangle as defined in step 2.\n\nIn essence, the transformation finds gray rectangles and paints a smaller red rectangle inside each of them, leaving a one-pixel gray border.\n"
