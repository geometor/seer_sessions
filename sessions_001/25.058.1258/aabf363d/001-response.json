The primary element is a contiguous shape of a single, non-zero color within each input grid. There's also a single, isolated, different-colored pixel in the bottom-left corner of the input that appears to relate to the color of the shape in the output. The background is always white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, and the main shape's color changes, but the shape stays constant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
