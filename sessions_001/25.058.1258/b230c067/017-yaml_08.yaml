observations:
  - example: 0
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: rectangle (3x3)
        position: (0,0)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue (1)
        shape: rectangle (3x3)
        position: (0,0)
        relation_to_input: Same position and size as input azure object.
      - color: red(2)
        shape: line
        position: (3, 0)
        relation_to_input:  marks original bottom boundary of azure object
    transformation: The azure object is recolored blue, and white pixels adjacent to azure object are recolored red.
  - example: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape: rectangle (3x5) with white (0) pixels on either end.
        position:
          start: (0, 1)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue (1)
        shape: rectangle (3x5) with red (2) cells on either end.
        position:
          start: (0, 1)
        relation_to_input: Same position, but expanded to fill the row.
    transformation: The azure object is recolored blue, and white pixels adjacent to azure object are recolored red.
  - example: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: azure (8)
        shape:  rectangle (3x3) with an single internal pixel of white(0)
        position: (1,1)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue (1)
        shape:  rectangle (3x3) with an single internal pixel of white(0)
        position: (1,1)
        relation_to_input: Same position and size as input azure object.
    transformation:  The azure object is recolored blue, white pixels adjacent to the *outside* of the azure object are NOT changed. White pixels *inside* the azure object are NOT changed.
