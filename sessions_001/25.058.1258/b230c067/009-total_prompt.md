Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. The pixels of interest are those with the value 8 (azure).

2.  **Recolor Target Pixels:**
    a. If the azure pixel is in the top right corner area (defined, in this case, by rows 1-3 and colums 7-9 inclusive), change the color to 2 (red)
    b. If the azure pixel is not in that top right corner area, change the color of the azure pixel to 1 (blue).

3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (those not azure) retain their original color/value.

4.  **Output:** The resulting grid, with recolored pixels, becomes the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
