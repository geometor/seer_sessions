objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)

  - name: yellow_line
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - shape: horizontal line, single row, across the entire grid.
      - position: row index 9

  - name: non_yellow_pixels
    type: pixels
    properties:
      - color: not 4
      - position: relative to yellow_line

actions:
  - name: duplicate_pixels
    description: Copy non-yellow pixels from the area above the yellow line.
    parameters:
      - source: input_grid, area above yellow_line
      - destination: output_grid, area below yellow_line

  - name: maintain position
    description: Keep the same position relative to the horizontal axes.
    parameters:
       - axis: x (column)

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - yellow_line exists in both input_grid and output_grid at the same row index.
  - non_yellow_pixels in the area below the yellow line in output_grid are duplicates of those above the yellow line, preserving column position.
