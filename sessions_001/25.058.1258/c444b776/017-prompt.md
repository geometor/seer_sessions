Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Landmark Row:** Find the row index where all pixels are yellow (color value 4).
2.  **Define Source Region:** The source region starts from the top of the grid (row 0) and extends up to, but does not include, the landmark row.
3. **Define Destination Region:** The destination region starts two rows *below* the landmark row.
4.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy the entire source region. Paste this copied region into the destination region.
5. **Clear Remaining Rows**: Set all rows below pasted region to black (0).
6. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the landmark row does not exists or destination goes beyond bounds, return the original input.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
