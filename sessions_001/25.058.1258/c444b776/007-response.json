The most prominent feature is a vertical line of yellow (4) pixels extending from the top to the bottom of the input grid. There's also a horizontal line of yellow pixels across the middle row. The output grid appears to maintain the central yellow line and reflect other colored pixels across this line, but not the line itself. The input image contains a combination of single, isolated, colored pixels and the solid line.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This is the reflection axis and its position and color do not change. The horizontal yellow line does change.\n2.  **Reflect Other Pixels:** For every non-yellow pixel in the input grid to the left or right of the central yellow line, find its corresponding position on the *opposite* side of the vertical axis (the vertical yellow line). If the non-yellow input pixel is N pixels away for the central line, then copy this pixel to N pixels away on the other side.\n3. The output of the process maintains the original central line.\n\n"
