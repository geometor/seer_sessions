<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1852x2482 at 0x7E120DD8B390>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on identifying the objects, their properties, actions, relationships, and the overall transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of varying dimensions, but seem to maintain the same dimensions.
*   **Pixels:** Individual cells within the grids, represented by single-digit integers (0-9), corresponding to colors.
* **Yellow line**: There is a persistent yellow line in the input and output.
* **Repeating Block** Non-zero pixels, excluding the yellow pixels, from the input grid appear to be duplicated and placed below the yellow line in the output.
* **Blank Spaces**: There are pixels of color 0 (white) between the yellow lines.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)

  - name: yellow_line
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
      - shape: horizontal line, single row, across the entire grid.
      - position: row index 9

  - name: non_yellow_pixels
    type: pixels
    properties:
      - color: not 4
      - position: relative to yellow_line

actions:
  - name: duplicate_pixels
    description: Copy non-yellow pixels from the area above the yellow line.
    parameters:
      - source: input_grid, area above yellow_line
      - destination: output_grid, area below yellow_line

  - name: maintain position
    description: Keep the same position relative to the horizontal axes.
    parameters:
       - axis: x (column)

relationships:
  - input_grid and output_grid have the same dimensions.
  - yellow_line exists in both input_grid and output_grid at the same row index.
  - non_yellow_pixels in the area below the yellow line in output_grid are duplicates of those above the yellow line, preserving column position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the yellow line:** Locate the horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. This line is consistently present in the same row index in both input and output.
2.  **Isolate Non-Yellow Pixels Above the Line:** Consider all pixels above the yellow line in the input grid. Exclude any pixels that are yellow (4).
3. **Duplicate and position below the yellow line:** Copy non-yellow pixels from the input grid and position the duplicate below the yellow line in the output grid.
4. **Maintain position relative to x axes**: The position relative to the x axes should be the same in the output grid as the input grid.
5. **Preserve Remainder of Grid**: all the pixels in the input, should exist in the output.

In essence, the transformation duplicates the non-yellow pixels from the top section of the grid (above the yellow line) to the bottom section (below the yellow line), maintaining their respective column positions, while keeping the yellow line in place.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
