Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Reflection Axis:** Examine the input grid to determine the axis of reflection. This can be:
    *   A **vertical line** of a single color that divides the grid into two symmetrical halves.
    *   A **horizontal line** of a single color that divides the grid into two symmetrical halves.
2.  **Reflect Across Axis:** For each cell not part of the reflection axis, find its corresponding position on the opposite side of the axis. The distance to the axis should be the same for both the original cell and its reflected counterpart. Copy the color of the original cell to the reflected position in the output grid.
3.  **Maintain Axis:** The reflection axis itself remains unchanged in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
