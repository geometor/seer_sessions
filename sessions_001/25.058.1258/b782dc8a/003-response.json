Here's my report on the input-output pair, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output grids are the same size (11 x 24).\n*   The primary colors involved are azure (8), green (3), red (2), and white(0).\n*   The input grid seems to have a \"noisy\" distribution of azure pixels, with a small cluster of green, red and white pixels near the center-right.\n*    The output maintains a similar structure (azure all around) but \"inserts\" green and red in an alternating horizontal and verticle pattern around where a non azure pixel is.\n*   It appears some kind of \"fill\", \"expansion\", or \"alternating insertion\" operation is applied to the non-azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If any neighbor is azure (8) then:\n   - Change the neighboring azure (8) pixel to green(3) if the last non-azure pixel was not green\n   - Change the neighboring azure(8) pixel to red(2) if the last non-azure pixel was not red\n   - Reset the 'last non-azure pixel' at each non-azure pixel, start with the last non azure was red.\n\nEssentially, for every non-azure pixel, the program checks the adjacent pixels.
