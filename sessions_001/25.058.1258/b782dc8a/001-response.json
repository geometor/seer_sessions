            "text": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, object identification, and a natural language program description:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of varying dimensions, composed of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.\n*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved appear to be azure (8), white (0), green (3), red (2), yellow (4), and blue(1).\n*    **Object Identification:** the prominent object is composed of azure (8) pixels. In each input grid, there appears to be one or more additional non-azure pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve a patterned alteration of the azure (8) pixels, which is influenced by the location of the non-azure colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify \"Seed\" Pixels:** Locate all pixels that are *not* azure (8). These are the \"seed\" pixels that initiate the transformation.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Azure Pixels:** For each azure (8) pixel in the input grid:\n\n    *   **Find Nearest Seed:** Determine the Manhattan distance to the nearest non-azure \"seed\" pixel.\n    *    **Determine color based on seed and distance:**\n        * In example one, if the nearest seed is green(3), cells an odd manhattan distance away are set to green(3) and cells an even distance away are set to red(2).\n          If the nearest seed is red(2), the cell colors are not changed.\n        * In example two, if the nearest seed is yellow(4), cells an odd manhattan distance away are set to yellow(4) and cells an even distance away are set to blue(1).\n        If the nearest seed is blue(1), the cell colors are not changed.\n    *   **Apply Transformation.** Set the current azure (8) cell's to the correct color\n\n3.  **Output:** The resulting grid after all azure (8) pixels have been processed is the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation creates a \"ripple\" effect from each seed pixel. the ripple alternates colors similar to a chess board pattern. If an azure pixel is closest to a seed that does not initiate a transformation, then it is not changed.\n"
