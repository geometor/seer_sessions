The predominant colors are white (0), azure (8), blue (1), and yellow (4). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. It appears some color replacements are occurring, with azure regions possibly playing a structural role, along with potential interactions between other colored objects. The input contains a central \"island\" of azure, blue, and yellow.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
