            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan for improvement:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a seemingly simple \"fill adjacent azure pixels\" rule, alternating between green and red, and resetting with each non-azure pixel as a starting point. However, the additional training examples reveal a more complex rule that isn't captured by this initial logic. The original strategy incorrectly focuses on a continuous application from a starting point, instead of independent application of a rule based on the current pixel and its surrounding context. The core issue is the stateful tracking of `last_non_azure`, that is not resetting appropriately.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors will involve:\n\n1.  **Discarding the incorrect stateful logic:** The `last_non_azure` variable and its associated logic are misleading and should be removed.\n2.  **Focusing on local context:** The transformation rule appears to depend *only* on the immediate neighbors of a pixel, *not* on a global state or traversal order.\n3.  **Re-evaluating the condition for change:** We need to determine the *exact* conditions under which an azure (8) pixel changes to green (3) or red (2), based solely on its immediate neighbors.\n4. **Independent Pixel Evaluation**: Each pixel should be evaluated to see if the transform logic applies and updated appropriately.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution and Manual Inspection)**\n\nLet's break down each example and the observed results, making notes, and adding properties for the YAML.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n```\nInput:\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 8 8]\n [8 0 8]]\nOutput:\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 3 8]\n [8 0 8]]\nResult:\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 3 8]\n [8 0 8]]\n```\n- Result is correct.\n- The white (0) pixel has an adjacent azure pixel, which turns green.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n```\nInput:\n[[8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 0 8]\n [8 8 8 8]]\nOutput:\n[[8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 3 8]\n [8 8 0 8]\n [8 8 3 8]]\n\nResult:\n[[8 8 8 8]\n [8 8 3 8]\n [8 8 0 8]\n [8 8 3 8]]\n```\n- Result is correct.\n- The single white pixel has two adjacent azure pixels. Both are turned green.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n```\nInput:\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 1 8]\n [8 8 8]]\nOutput:\n[[8 2 8]\n [8 1 8]\n [8 2 8]]\nResult:\n[[8 3 8]\n [8 1 8]\n [8 3 8]]\n\n```\n- Result is **incorrect**.  The azure pixels adjacent to the blue (1) pixel are turning green instead of red.\n\n**Example 4:**\n\n```\nInput:\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 8 8]\n [8 8 8]]\nOutput:\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 8 8]\n [8 8 8]]\nResult:\n[[8 8 8]\n [8 8 8]\n [8 8 8]]\n```\n- Result is correct. No non-azure pixels, so no change.\n\n**Example 5:**\n\n```\nInput:\n[[5 8 8]\n [8 8 8]\n [8 8 6]]\n\nOutput:\n[[5 8 8]\n [2 8 2]\n [8 8 6]]\nResult:\n[[5 3 3]\n [3 3 3]\n [3 3 6]]\n```\n- Result is **incorrect**. Very different from the expected output.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"Change adjacent colors\"\n  - objects:\n      - name: pixel\n        properties:\n          - color: \"integer value 0-9, representing a color\"\n          - adjacency: \"pixels directly above, below, left, or right\"\n  - actions:\n      - description: \"Change the color of azure pixels based on adjacent non-azure pixels.\"\n        conditions:\n          - \"If a non-azure pixel is adjacent to an azure pixel, the azure pixel's color may change.\"\n          - \"The new color of the azure pixel depends on some characteristic of the non-azure adjacent pixel.\"\n        results:\n         - \"Azure becomes Green adjacent to White and Yellow\"\n         - \"Azure becomes Red adjacent to Blue\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify** azure (8) pixels.\n3.  For each azure (8) pixel, **examine** its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n4.  **Check** if the adjacent pixel is not an azure (8) pixel.\n    - if the non-azure neighbor is white (0) or yellow(4), change the azure pixel to green (3).\n    - if the non-azure neighbor is blue (1), change the azure pixel to red (2).\n    - If the neighbor is any other color do nothing.\n5.  **Skip** all non-azure pixels - they remain unchanged.\n6. **Output** - return the modified grid.\n\nKey Changes and Reasoning:\n\n*   **Removed statefulness:** The concept of a `last_non_azure` color is entirely removed.\n*   **Conditional Color Change**:  The condition for changing the color is based on the neighboring pixel, not the history of colors. White or yellow neighbors cause a change to green. Blue causes a change to red.\n*    **Independent Evaluation:** The program now focuses on each azure pixel individually. Its new color depends *only* on its neighbors.\n*   **Simplified Logic:** The program avoids unnecessary complexity by directly checking for the specific neighbor colors that trigger changes.\n"
