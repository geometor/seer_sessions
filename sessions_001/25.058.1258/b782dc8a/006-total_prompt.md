Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan for improvement:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a seemingly simple "fill adjacent azure pixels" rule, alternating between green and red, and resetting with each non-azure pixel as a starting point. However, the additional training examples reveal a more complex rule that isn't captured by this initial logic. The original strategy incorrectly focuses on a continuous application from a starting point, instead of independent application of a rule based on the current pixel and its surrounding context. The core issue is the stateful tracking of `last_non_azure`, that is not resetting appropriately.

The strategy for resolving the errors will involve:

1.  **Discarding the incorrect stateful logic:** The `last_non_azure` variable and its associated logic are misleading and should be removed.
2.  **Focusing on local context:** The transformation rule appears to depend *only* on the immediate neighbors of a pixel, *not* on a global state or traversal order.
3.  **Re-evaluating the condition for change:** We need to determine the *exact* conditions under which an azure (8) pixel changes to green (3) or red (2), based solely on its immediate neighbors.
4. **Independent Pixel Evaluation**: Each pixel should be evaluated to see if the transform logic applies and updated appropriately.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution and Manual Inspection)**

Let's break down each example and the observed results, making notes, and adding properties for the YAML.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[[8 8 8]
 [8 8 8]
 [8 0 8]]
Output:
[[8 8 8]
 [8 3 8]
 [8 0 8]]
Result:
[[8 8 8]
 [8 3 8]
 [8 0 8]]
```
- Result is correct.
- The white (0) pixel has an adjacent azure pixel, which turns green.

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
[[8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 0 8]
 [8 8 8 8]]
Output:
[[8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 3 8]
 [8 8 0 8]
 [8 8 3 8]]

Result:
[[8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 3 8]
 [8 8 0 8]
 [8 8 3 8]]
```
- Result is correct.
- The single white pixel has two adjacent azure pixels. Both are turned green.

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
[[8 8 8]
 [8 1 8]
 [8 8 8]]
Output:
[[8 2 8]
 [8 1 8]
 [8 2 8]]
Result:
[[8 3 8]
 [8 1 8]
 [8 3 8]]

```
- Result is **incorrect**.  The azure pixels adjacent to the blue (1) pixel are turning green instead of red.

**Example 4:**

```
Input:
[[8 8 8]
 [8 8 8]
 [8 8 8]]
Output:
[[8 8 8]
 [8 8 8]
 [8 8 8]]
Result:
[[8 8 8]
 [8 8 8]
 [8 8 8]]
```
- Result is correct. No non-azure pixels, so no change.

**Example 5:**

```
Input:
[[5 8 8]
 [8 8 8]
 [8 8 6]]

Output:
[[5 8 8]
 [2 8 2]
 [8 8 6]]
Result:
[[5 3 3]
 [3 3 3]
 [3 3 6]]
```
- Result is **incorrect**. Very different from the expected output.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Change adjacent colors"
  - objects:
      - name: pixel
        properties:
          - color: "integer value 0-9, representing a color"
          - adjacency: "pixels directly above, below, left, or right"
  - actions:
      - description: "Change the color of azure pixels based on adjacent non-azure pixels."
        conditions:
          - "If a non-azure pixel is adjacent to an azure pixel, the azure pixel's color may change."
          - "The new color of the azure pixel depends on some characteristic of the non-azure adjacent pixel."
        results:
         - "Azure becomes Green adjacent to White and Yellow"
         - "Azure becomes Red adjacent to Blue"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** azure (8) pixels.
3.  For each azure (8) pixel, **examine** its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).
4.  **Check** if the adjacent pixel is not an azure (8) pixel.
    - if the non-azure neighbor is white (0) or yellow(4), change the azure pixel to green (3).
    - if the non-azure neighbor is blue (1), change the azure pixel to red (2).
    - If the neighbor is any other color do nothing.
5.  **Skip** all non-azure pixels - they remain unchanged.
6. **Output** - return the modified grid.

Key Changes and Reasoning:

*   **Removed statefulness:** The concept of a `last_non_azure` color is entirely removed.
*   **Conditional Color Change**:  The condition for changing the color is based on the neighboring pixel, not the history of colors. White or yellow neighbors cause a change to green. Blue causes a change to red.
*    **Independent Evaluation:** The program now focuses on each azure pixel individually. Its new color depends *only* on its neighbors.
*   **Simplified Logic:** The program avoids unnecessary complexity by directly checking for the specific neighbor colors that trigger changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
