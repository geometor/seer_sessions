Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the central "island":** Locate the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels surrounding the blue (1) and yellow (4) pixels in the input.

2. **Mirror/Reflect:**
    - Notice that the central "island" of azure, blue, and yellow has its colors mirrored on either side of the central yellow and blue regions.
    - The azure acts as the mirror boundary and the colors are reflected in this boundary.

3.  **Color Replacement (within the mirrored region):**
    -   Within the region that's reflected, replace azure with a new reflected color in the output grid based on reflection across the boundary:
        -   Yellow on the right boundary becomes azure on the right hand side of the output
        -   Blue on the right boundary becomes Yellow on the right hand side of the output
        -   Azure on the right boundary becomes blue on the right hand side of the output

4.  **Color preservation (outside defined region):** All pixels not explicitly mentioned above retain their original color from the input grid in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the derived code focused on identifying a central "island" of azure, blue, and yellow pixels, then performing a mirrored color swap within that island. While this worked for the first example, it fails to generalize correctly to the other training examples. The main issues appear to be:

1.  **Incorrect Island Identification**: The `find_island` function, designed to find a contiguous region of azure surrounding blue and yellow, isn't working reliably. Sometimes it captures too little or too much.
2. **Strict mirroring:** It appears that transformation does perform a mirroring on each individual axis.
3. **Overly Specific Color Mapping:** The initial color swapping rules are too specific (yellow becomes azure, blue becomes yellow, azure becomes blue). The actual color transformations seem to be based on a mirroring relative to the boundaries, not a fixed color map.

The strategy to address these errors will involve:

1.  **Revising Island Definition:** Instead of focusing on a contiguous azure region *surrounding* the colors, reframe the "island" concept. The key appears to be mirroring on different axis.
2.  **Generalized Mirroring Logic**: Remove any color based logic in favor of performing mirroring around each of the axis
3.  **Iterative Refinement**: Test the revised program after each change on all training examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get precise data, let's use `code_execution` to examine the grids and the results.

**YAML Facts**

    description: A region of azure pixels.
    role: background

  - id: blue_object

    description: one or more blue pixels
    role: transformed object

  - name: vertical_mirror
    description: Colors are mirrored across a horizontal axis within a region defined around the blue object
    affects: blue_object, yellow_object, and azure_region
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Axis:**
    *   Identify the contiguous regions of blue(1) and yellow(4)

2.  **Horizontal Mirroring:**
    *   Find the minimum and maximum column of the yellow pixels
    *   Within the identified region, and to the left of the minimum and to the right of the maximum, mirror the colors.
    *   For pixels to the left of the minimum yellow column: find the `mirror_c` by calculating `mirror_c =  min_yellow_col + (min_yellow_col - c) - 1`. If an azure, blue, or yellow pixel with the coordinate(`r`,`mirror_c`) is within the defined region, replace the color of pixel (`r`,`c`) with the mirrored color.
    *   For pixels to the right of the maximum yellow column: find the `mirror_c` by calculating `mirror_c =  max_yellow_col - (c - max_yellow_col) + 1`. If an azure, blue, or yellow pixel with the coordinate(`r`,`mirror_c`) is within the defined region, replace the color of pixel (`r`,`c`) with the mirrored color.

3.  **Vertical Mirroring:**
   * Find the minimum and maximum row of the blue pixels
   * Within the identified region, and above the minimum and below the maximum, mirror the colors.
   * For pixels above the minimum blue row, find the `mirror_r` by calculating `mirror_r = min_blue_row + (min_blue_row - r) - 1`. If an azure, blue, or yellow pixel with coordinate (`mirror_r`,`c`) is in a region, replace the color of pixel (`r`,`c`) with the mirrored color.
   * For pixels below the maximum blue row, find the `mirror_r` by calculating `mirror_r = max_blue_row - (r - max_blue_row) + 1`. If an azure, blue, or yellow pixel with coordinate (`mirror_r`,`c`) is in a region, replace the color of pixel (`r`,`c`) with the mirrored color.

4.  **Color Preservation:** Any pixels not within the mirrored region, or not of color azure, blue, or yellow within the mirrored region, retain their original color from the input grid.

The next step is to translate the revised natural language to a new python function

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

    # change output pixels
