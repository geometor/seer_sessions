Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and task examples to refine the natural language program and address any discrepancies.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy was to identify gray (5) regions and use a flood-fill algorithm to replace the gray with the color of an adjacent non-gray, non-white pixel. This approach seems generally correct for the given examples, but it might need adjustments to handle edge cases or more complex scenarios, which might show in future tasks.

**Strategy for Resolving Potential Issues:**
1. **Analyze all example grids, not just the first**: use code to analyze all the examples in detail
2. **Edge Cases:** Ensure the `find_seed_color` function correctly handles cases where a gray region is at the edge of the grid or surrounded only by white and gray pixels, there may need to be some additional logic to handle the lack of seed color.
3. **Multiple Seed Colors:** If multiple, different non-gray, non-white colors is adjacent to the gray, the current logic only pick the first one it see, we need to handle the seed color selection is not deterministic.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution):**

Here's the output of the provided analysis code.
```text
Example 1: Total Gray Regions = 1, Valid Seed Count = 1
Example 2: Total Gray Regions = 1, Valid Seed Count = 1
Example 3: Total Gray Regions = 1, Valid Seed Count = 1
```
The provided testing code confirms that in each example grid, there's exactly one contiguous gray region, and each of these gray regions has at least one valid, non-gray, non-white neighbor.

**YAML Block - Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    description: Represents the input and output data.
    properties:
      - rows: variable
      - cols: variable
      - cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: gray_region
    type: contiguous_pixels
    description: A group of adjacent pixels with the value 5 (gray).
    properties:
      - color: 5
      - adjacent_colors: list of colors of neighboring pixels

  - name: seed_pixel
    type: pixel
    description: A non-gray, non-white pixel adjacent to a gray region.
    properties:
      - color: integer (not 0 or 5)

actions:
  - name: find_seed
    description: Locates a seed pixel for a given gray region.
    input: gray_region, grid
    output: seed_pixel

  - name: flood_fill
    description: Replaces all pixels in a gray region with the color of the seed pixel.
    input: gray_region, seed_pixel, grid
    output: modified_grid
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of gray (value 5) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Find Seed Color:** For each gray region, examine its neighboring pixels (up, down, left, right). Identify a "seed" pixel, which is a neighbor that is neither gray (5) nor white (0).
3.  **Flood Fill:** If a valid seed pixel is found, replace the entire gray region with the color of the seed pixel using a flood-fill algorithm. If multiple different valid seed pixels are adjacent to the same gray object, maintain the original grey color.
4. **Output:** if a gray object does not have a seed pixel neighbor, do not perform the flood fill.

The key improvement here vs the original natural language program, is adding
the requirement to NOT flood fill if there is no seed pixel, and the
clarification about multiple seed colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
