The primary operation appears to be a kind of \"color replacement\" or \"selective recoloring\". Specifically, a certain color (represented by a digit) within the input grid is replaced by the color of a neighboring pixel. It seems that only one color is subject to the replacement in each example, while all other colors are maintained. The shapes created by same colored pixels influence where replacement color comes from.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If left side is Target color or 0, then locate pixel directly above first instance.\n\n3. **Replace target color pixels:** Replace the color in the target color pixels with the seed color.\n4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other colors in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n"
