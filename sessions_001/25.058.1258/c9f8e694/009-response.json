The output grid retains white, green, and yellow, but all gray pixels are replaced by the color of the non-gray pixel that initiated the gray area.\n*   **Shapes:** There are distinct regions or \"blobs\" of connected pixels of the same color. Gray areas seem to be bounded or \"seeded\" by other colors.\n* **Boundaries**: gray areas extend until a change to white or another color\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
