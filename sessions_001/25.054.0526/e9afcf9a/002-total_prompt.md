## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7B191ABAB820>

**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7B19135CEB00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid consists of two rows: the top row is all green (3), and the bottom row is all maroon (9). The output grid also has two rows, but the colors alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in each row. The alternation pattern is offset between the two rows.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 2
      columns: 6
      cells:
        - color: integer value representing color (0-9)
          position: (row, column)

  - type: row
    properties:
      index: integer (0 or 1)

actions:
  - name: alternate_colors
    input: two colors, starting color
    output: sequence of alternating colors

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
  - type: row_transformation
    description: Each row in the input grid is transformed into a corresponding row in the output grid.
  - type: color_alternation
    description: Colors in the output rows alternate based on the input row colors.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Identify the two distinct colors present in the input grid. In this case, they are green (3) from the first row and maroon (9) from the second row.

2.  **Row 1 Transformation:** For the first output row, start with the first color (green/3). Alternate between the two colors (green/3 and maroon/9) for each subsequent cell in the row.

3.  **Row 2 Transformation:** For the second output row, start with the second color (maroon/9). Alternate between the two colors (maroon/9 and green/3) for each subsequent cell in the row.

4.  **Grid Construction:** Combine the transformed rows to create the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
