            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the need for rotation. However, the implementation of the rotation is flawed. It appears the code is rotating *something*, but not correctly calculating the new positions of the pixels after a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. Specifically the use of the `center_of_mass` is incorrect as it's trying to identify objects, but it is not helping to determine the new position relative to the center of rotation. The major error is in the `rotate_point` function and how that function is applied with a center determined relative to the labeled object, not the center of the input grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fix the Rotation Logic:** The core issue is the incorrect calculation of rotated pixel positions. I will re-examine and simplify the `rotate_point` function, ensuring it correctly applies the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation formula around the *center of the grid*, not the center of mass of each object.\n2.  **Object Identification is good:** The `get_objects` method and use of `scipy.ndimage.label` is good.\n3.  **Re-test and Iterate:** After correcting the rotation, I'll re-run the tests on all examples and examine the results to ensure the fix works universally.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (using manual calculation since I can't execute code here):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input Size: 3x3\n    *   Output Size: 3x3\n    *   Objects:\n        *   Orange (3) at (0,0), (0,1)\n        *   Azure (8) at (0,2)\n        *   Green (7) at (1,1)\n        *    Grey(5) at (2,0)\n    *   Expected Transformation: Standard 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n    *   Observed Error: The colors are wrong and the position is wrong.\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input Size: 3x3\n    *   Output Size: 3x3\n    *  Objects:\n        *  Red(2) at (0,2)\n        *  Blue(1) at (1,0)\n        *  Grey(5) at (0,0), (0,1)\n    *   Expected Transformation: Standard 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n    *   Observed Error: The colors and placement are wrong.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    input_objects:\n      - color: orange\n        shape: line\n        initial_positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\n      - color: azure\n        shape: single pixel\n        initial_positions: [[0, 2]]\n      - color: green\n        shape: single pixel\n        initial_positions: [[1, 1]]\n      - color: grey\n        shape: single pixel\n        initial_positions: [[2, 0]]\n    transformation:\n      type: rotation\n      direction: counter-clockwise\n      angle: 90\n      center: grid center\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    input_objects:\n      - color: grey\n        shape: line\n        initial_positions: [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\n      - color: red\n        shape: single pixel\n        initial_positions: [[0, 2]]\n      - color: blue\n        shape: single pixel\n        initial_positions: [[1, 0]]\n    transformation:\n      type: rotation\n      direction: counter-clockwise\n      angle: 90\n      center: grid center\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid is scanned to identify distinct objects. Objects are defined as contiguous regions (including single pixels) of the same color.\n2.  **Grid Center:** The center of the input grid is calculated. This will be the pivot point for the rotation.\n3.  **Rotate Grid:** The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n4.  **Object Positions:** For each pixel in each identified object, calculate its new position after the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation around the grid's center.\n5.  **Output Grid:** Create a new grid with dimensions swapped (rows become columns, columns become rows) due to the rotation. Place each object's pixels in their new, calculated positions within this output grid, maintaining their original colors. If a calculated position falls outside the output grid's boundaries (which shouldn't happen with a correct rotation), it is ignored.\n"
