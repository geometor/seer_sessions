Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for updating the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program, "The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise," is partially correct. The generated code correctly rotates the grid's structure. However, it doesn't perfectly match the expected outputs. The "Transformed Output" in both examples show a rotation, but the positioning of the colors/numbers within the rotated grid is incorrect, causing a pixel mismatch. The issue isn't with the rotation itself, but likely with how individual elements or "objects" are being treated within the grid during rotation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Object Perception:** We need to refine how "objects" within the grid are perceived. The current code assumes the entire grid is a single object. However, the examples suggest that connected components of the same color might be treated as individual objects, maintaining their relative positions during rotation.
2.  **Detailed Comparisons:** Carefully analyze how the positions of colors/numbers change between the input, expected output, and transformed output. Look for specific patterns in these positional shifts.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect more precise object handling during rotation.
4.  **Example Input 2**: Analyze and model

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Individual connected components of the same color (single pixels or groups) are treated as distinct objects. These objects maintain their shape and internal arrangement of pixels, and their positions within the grid are updated based on the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the entire grid, relative to the center of the grid.

**Example Input 2 Discussion**

The initial implementation, `np.rot90`, simply rotates the entire grid as one.
This is incorrect, because we want the groups of colored pixels to maintain their relative position to each other after rotation.
For example:

```
5 5 2        0 0 0
1 0 0   ->   0 0 1
0 0 0        2 5 5
```

Notice how the pair of `5`s is rotated to the lower right hand corner and the
single `1` is now in the center.

I am not quite sure how to model that using just numpy - it seems we need to
know the center of the grid and rotate the groups around that center.
