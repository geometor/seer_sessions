## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191ABABC70>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191ABABFA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation from input to output appears to be a rotation or reflection, as the relative positions of the numbers change, but all the original numbers are preserved. It's a spatial transformation.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit_integers
    element_type: color_codes
  - observation: all_input_elements_present_in_output
    details: no_new_elements_introduced_no_elements_removed
  - transformation: spatial_rearrangement
    type: likely_rotation_or_reflection
  - object: the entire grid
    property: spatial_arrangement_of_elements
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The numbers change positions as if the entire grid was a single object being physically rotated by that angle.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
