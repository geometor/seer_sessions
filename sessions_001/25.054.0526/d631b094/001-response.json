The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue). The output grid contains only 1s (blue). The positions of the 1s in the input grid seem relevant. The output grid's dimensions are smaller than the input grid's. The transformation involves a reduction in size and seems to be summarizing or extracting information about the blue pixels in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
