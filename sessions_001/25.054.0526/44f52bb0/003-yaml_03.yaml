facts:
  - observation: "All outputs are 1x1 grids."
  - observation: "The output pixel is not always blue (it can be orange)."
  - observation: "The output value does not directly correlate with the count of any single input color."
  - observation: "Input grids contain only white (0) and red (2) pixels."
  - observation: "Examples 1 and 3 have identical input and output, suggesting positional independence for some aspect of the rule."
  - observation: "Examples 2 and 6 have identical input and output."
  - observation: "The output value might depend on a combination of input pixel values rather than a simple count."
  - observation: "The number of red squares can be an odd or even number."
