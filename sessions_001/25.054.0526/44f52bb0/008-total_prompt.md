## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191A9FAEF0>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7B19135CEE90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into a single numerical output. The input grid appears to have a pattern of '2's (red) and '0's (white), while the output is a single digit '7' (orange). The core challenge lies in deciphering the relationship between the input grid's configuration and the resulting single-digit output. It seems to involve counting or some kind of operation on input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid of integers.
  - observation: Output is a single integer.
  - property: Input grid cells contain values 0 or 2.
  - property: Value 2 in the input corresponds to the color red.
  - property: Value 0 in the input corresponds to the color white.
  - property: Output value 7, it corresponds to the color orange.
  - relationship: The output integer seems related to number of cells with value 2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count the red cells:** Iterate through the input grid and count the number of cells with the value '2'.
2.  **Return specific value:** if red cells count is 3, returns 7.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
