## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191A9FAEF0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7B191353ACE0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing two colors: red (2) and white (0). The output is a 1x1 grid containing a single blue (1) pixel. The transformation seems to involve counting or summarizing the input grid in some way, resulting in a single value representing the entire input. The specific color blue (1) in the output suggests a numerical count, potentially of a specific color or feature within the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: [0, 2]  # white, red
    properties:
      - color_distribution:
          0: 4 # white
          2: 5 # red
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [1, 1]
    elements: [ 1 ]
    properties:
       color: blue

actions:
  - type: count
    target: specific color
    value: red

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains multiple pixels of different colors.
  - output_grid: single pixel.
  - output_value: represents a count of a feature in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Output** the count of red pixels as a single pixel grid, colored blue and containing the number of red squares.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
