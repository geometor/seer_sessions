## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191A943E20>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B191ABABC70>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid appears to be entirely filled with a single color, specifically the color corresponding to the integer '4' (yellow). The dimensions of the grid are 3x3. The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific color within the input and then flood-filling the entire output grid with that color. It is highly probable that the selected color '4' is the most frequent color of the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: color_replacement
input:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements:
    - value: 4
      color: yellow
      count: 3
    - value: 6
      color: magenta
      count: 2
    - value: 3
      color: green
      count: 2
    - value: 8
      color: azure
      count: 1
    - value: 0
      color: white
      count: 1
output:
  type: grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements:
    - value: 4
      color: yellow
      count: 9
transformation:
  type: flood_fill
  criteria: most_frequent_color

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze Input Grid:** Examine the input grid and count the occurrences of each unique color (integer value).
2.  **Identify Dominant Color:** Determine the color that appears most frequently in the input grid.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
4.  **Flood Fill:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the integer value corresponding to the most frequent color identified in step 2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
