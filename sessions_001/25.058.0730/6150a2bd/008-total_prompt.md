## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x77844EADECB0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x77844EB2F930>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The colors in the input grid seem to be rearranged and potentially mirrored or rotated in the output grid. There's a specific focus on non-white (non-zero) pixels, as their positions and values are the ones primarily changing. The transformation appears to be a rotation or reflection, combined with potentially swapping positions.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
  - type: cells
    description: Each cell contains a single digit representing a color.
  - type: object
    description: non-white pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: transformation
    description:  The non-white pixels in the input seem to have their positions and values re-arranged according to a specific permutation.
    details: It appears like a 180-degree rotation, with values maintained.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-white (non-zero) pixels in the input grid and note their color and position.

2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the grid by 180 degrees. This means the pixel at position (r, c) moves to position (height - 1 - r, width - 1 - c).

3. **Maintain Values** Keep original color values of the identified objects at their corresponding new location.

4.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the transformed pixel positions and colors, leaving the original white pixels (zeros) as they are.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
