The colors in the input grid seem to be rearranged and potentially mirrored or rotated in the output grid. There's a specific focus on non-white (non-zero) pixels, as their positions and values are the ones primarily changing. The transformation appears to be a rotation or reflection, combined with potentially swapping positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This means the pixel at position (r, c) moves to position (height - 1 - r, width - 1 - c).\n\n3. **Maintain Values** Keep original color values of the identified objects at their corresponding new location.\n\n4.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the transformed pixel positions and colors, leaving the original white pixels (zeros) as they are.\n"
