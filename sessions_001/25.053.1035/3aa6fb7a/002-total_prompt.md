# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7A0CC3D31BA0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, representing colors. The primary color observed changing is '8' (azure). There's an introduction of the color '1' (blue) in the output that wasn't present in the input. The positions of the azure pixels seem significant, as the blue pixels appear within the azure regions.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: azure_pixels
    properties:
      - color: 8 (azure)
      - shape: contiguous regions
    actions:
      - identified:  "Locations are noted."
  - object: blue_pixels
    properties:
     - color: 1 (blue)
    actions:
      - created: "Appear in output grid"
      - placed: "Within the bounding box of azure regions, specifically on the 'top-left' pixel that has the minimum column value"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Find Minimum Column for each Row with Azure:** In each row, identify the azure pixel that has the minimum column value.
3.  **Introduce Blue Pixel:** Change the identified azure pixel value to blue pixel (1).
4  **All Else:** keep the original input


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
