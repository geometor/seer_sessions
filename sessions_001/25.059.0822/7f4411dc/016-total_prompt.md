Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value represented by a digit (0-9). The primary colors involved are white (0) and gray (5). The input grid contains scattered gray pixels, while the output grid shows a concentrated rectangular block of gray pixels in the center, with the surrounding pixels changed to white. The transformation seems to involve some form of object identification (the gray pixels), and then a manipulation or filtering based on location and possibly connectivity/shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: gray_pixels
    color: gray (5)
    initial_state: scattered
    final_state: concentrated_rectangle
  - name: white_pixels
    color: white (0)
    initial_state: background
    final_state: background_expanded

actions:
  - name: remove_outliers
    description: Eliminate isolated gray pixels.
  - name: consolidate
    description: Form a dense rectangle with the remaining gray pixels.
  - name: fill_background
    description: change other non-grey cells to white

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Gray pixels are initially dispersed and become adjacent in a rectangular shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine** the minimal bounding rectangle that can enclose main object of grey color .
3.  **Remove** any isolated gray pixels from the input grid if it is at the border.
4. **Keep** the internal block of grey and consolidate.
5.  **Change** all other pixels, outside of the consolidated gray rectangle, to white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
