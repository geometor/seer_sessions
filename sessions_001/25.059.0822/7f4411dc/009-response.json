The transformation seems to involve removing some of the magenta pixels, specifically those that aren't part of larger, contiguous blocks. It appears to be a form of noise reduction or simplification, retaining only substantial magenta structures. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically.\n2.  **Evaluate Block Size/Connectivity:** For each identified magenta block, perform a size/connectivity check. There is some minimal size filter that is applied. I think a simple approach to connectivity may work, such as blocks must have >2 magenta pixels.\n3.  **Filter Blocks:** Remove magenta pixels that do not meet the criteria. Magenta pixels that *are* part of blocks that meet the criteria will be preserved.\n4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid, retaining the qualifying magenta blocks and setting all other pixels to white (0). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation keeps the \"larger\" magenta shapes and removes the \"smaller\" or isolated magenta pixels. It seems that the definition of \"large\" vs \"small\" or \"isolated\" is relative. It is critical that connectivity must be horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.\n"
