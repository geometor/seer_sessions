The primary colors involved are white (0) and gray (5). The input grid contains scattered gray pixels, while the output grid shows a concentrated rectangular block of gray pixels in the center, with the surrounding pixels changed to white. The transformation seems to involve some form of object identification (the gray pixels), and then a manipulation or filtering based on location and possibly connectivity/shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
