            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. The results from executing on other examples in the training set reveal discrepancies between the expected outputs and produced outputs. This suggests the initial program doesn't capture the full transformation rule, and we need to learn from all the examples, not just the first.\n\nThe core issue is that only orange is considered. A more generalized rule\napplies. My strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each example's input, expected output, and actual output. Note specific cells where the transformation differs.\n2.  **Identify Missed Patterns:** Determine what patterns or rules the current code *fails* to capture.\n3.  **Generalize the Program:** Revise the natural language program to incorporate these missing elements, making it more general and accurate across all examples.\n4.  **Focus on Contiguous groups:** The contiguous group check is good, but it is too focused.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis**\n\nI need to understand *why* some pixels change and others don't. I need to examine the size of the contiguous groups to find the right threshold.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_adjacent_to_white(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a cell at (r, c) is adjacent to a white (0) cell.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == 0:\n                return True\n    return False\n    \ndef get_contiguous_group_size(grid, r, c, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate maximum group size of contiguous cells of same color in any single direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    max_size = 0\n\n    #
