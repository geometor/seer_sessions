The transformation seems to selectively remove certain colored objects/pixels based on some criteria. The core elements appear to be:\n\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous regions of pixels of the same color.\n*   **Colors:** Each digit (0-9) represents a distinct color.\n*   **Background:** The color '0' (white) seems to act as the background.\n*   **Selection/Removal:** Some objects are removed in the output, while others are retained. The selection criteria are not immediately obvious but is the key.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

An object is a group of one or more adjacent pixels of the same color. Adjacency includes both side-by-side and diagonal connections.\n2.  **Filter Objects:** Iterate through the identified objects.\n    *   If an object consists of a single pixel, remove it (set its value to 0).\n    *.  If an object has a shape other than a single isolated pixel, keep all object pixels that are direct neighbors.\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by setting removed object pixels to 0 (the background color), and preserving the remaining object pixels with their original colors.\n\nEssentially, the rule appears to be: **Remove all single-pixel objects of any color, and keep all objects made of multiple connected pixels.** This maintains objects with more than one pixel, while isolated pixels disappear.\n"
