Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, most of which are white (0) and some of which are magenta (6). The transformation seems to involve removing some of the magenta pixels, specifically those that aren't part of larger, contiguous blocks. It appears to be a form of noise reduction or simplification, retaining only substantial magenta structures. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 17x17
      cell_values: [0, 6]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        6: magenta
  - type: magenta_block
    properties:
      shape: contiguous
      size: variable
      state: [retained, removed]

actions:
  - name: identify_magenta_blocks
    description: Locate contiguous groups of magenta pixels.
  - name: evaluate_block_size
    description: Determine the size or extent of each magenta block.
  - name: filter_blocks
    description: Remove isolated or small magenta blocks, keeping larger ones.

relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally and vertically.
  - containment: Magenta blocks are contained within the grid.
  - transformation:  The input grid transforms into the output grid by removing certain magenta blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Magenta Blocks:** Scan the input grid to identify all contiguous blocks of magenta (6) pixels. Contiguous means connected horizontally or vertically.
2.  **Evaluate Block Size/Connectivity:** For each identified magenta block, perform a size/connectivity check. There is some minimal size filter that is applied. I think a simple approach to connectivity may work, such as blocks must have >2 magenta pixels.
3.  **Filter Blocks:** Remove magenta pixels that do not meet the criteria. Magenta pixels that *are* part of blocks that meet the criteria will be preserved.
4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid, retaining the qualifying magenta blocks and setting all other pixels to white (0). The dimensions of the output grid are identical to the input grid.

In simpler terms, the transformation keeps the "larger" magenta shapes and removes the "smaller" or isolated magenta pixels. It seems that the definition of "large" vs "small" or "isolated" is relative. It is critical that connectivity must be horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
