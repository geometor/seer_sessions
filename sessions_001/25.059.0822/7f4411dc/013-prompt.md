Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Magenta Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color magenta (6) in the input grid.

2.  **Preserve Isolated Corner Pixel:** If a magenta pixel is located at the extreme top-right corner of the grid, preserve this magenta pixel.

3. **Preserve Edge Pixel** If a magenta pixel exists in the middle of the left edge of the grid (row = height/2, where height equals number of rows - 1, and column = 0) , preserve it

4. **Preserve larger contiguous blocks:** Identify contiguous blocks of magenta pixels (where pixels are directly adjacent horizontally or vertically). If a contiguous block contains more than two magenta pixels, preserve all pixels within that block.

5.  **Preserve Grid of 4:** If magenta pixels form a 2x2 grid anywhere on the canvas, they are preserved

6.  **All Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid should be white (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
