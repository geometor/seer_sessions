Some are single pixels and others larger connected blocks.\n*    The output grid appears to be the same as input with some of the orange pixels changing to white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If an orange pixel is only connected to one or two other orange pixels, those stay.\n5.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid.\n\nIn simple terms, the transformation removes the \"orange\" shapes if they are adjacent to a \"white\" pixel and part of a larger \"orange\" object. It preserves a smaller orange pixel (1x1) only if there are no adjecent white pixels.\n"
