Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved removing orange (7) pixels adjacent to white (0) pixels *and* part of a contiguous orange group of size 3 or more. The tests on subsequent examples reveal that this rule isn't universally applicable. We need to examine the other training examples to understand where the initial assumptions break down and identify the *actual* generalized rule. The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Examine the input, expected output, and actual output for each training example. Focus on where the actual output differs from the expected output, as these discrepancies highlight the flaws in the current rule.
2.  **Identify Misconceptions:** Determine why the current code failed. Was the adjacency condition wrong? Was the group size condition wrong? Or is there a completely different rule at play?
3.  **Reformulate the Rule:** Based on the analysis, formulate a new natural language program that accurately describes the transformation.
4.  **Verify the process** Re-check against the examples, this won't be perfect, and provide the details for the next iteration

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To help with the analysis, I will detail each example, and summarize any obvious errors.

    Error: All orange pixels have been changed to white (0).

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: orange (7)
  - color: white (0)

properties:
  - orange_group_size:
      description: Number of contiguous orange pixels.
      values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
  - adjacent_to_white:
      description: Whether an orange pixel is next to a white pixel.
      values: [true, false]

actions:
  - change_color:
      description: Change the color of an orange pixel to white.
      condition: "If NO white pixels adjacent, keep orange, and if ANY white
      pixels are adjacent and of length three or greater, make white"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Orange Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color orange (value 7).
2.  **Check for White Neighbors:** For *each* orange pixel, determine if ANY of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) are white (value 0).
3.  **Contiguous Length Check** If an orange pixel is adjacent to a white, determine the maximum contiguous length of orange in any direction.
4.  **Conditional Removal:** If an orange pixel *is* adjacent to a white pixel *and* the maximum contiguous length is three or greater, change the orange pixel to white (0); otherwise, leave the orange pixel unchanged.

**Key Changes and Reasoning**
The original rule had two errors - example three changes *all* of the orange
pixels to white, even with no adjacent white. Examining example three we realize
that if *any* white pixels are present *anywhere* in the grid then *all* groups
of three or more are changed to white, even if they are not adjacent.

The revised logic focuses on *any* adjacent pixels, not *all*. If an orange pixel is adjacent to at least one white, the action proceeds.

The revised natural language program and the corresponding YAML facts capture this more accurately.
