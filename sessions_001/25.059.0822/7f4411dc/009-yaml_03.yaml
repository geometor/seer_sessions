actions:
  - name: identify_magenta_blocks
    description: Locate contiguous groups of magenta pixels.
  - name: evaluate_block_size
    description: Determine the size or extent of each magenta block.
  - name: filter_blocks
    description: Remove isolated or small magenta blocks, keeping larger ones.
