Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation removes orange (7) pixels from the input grid under specific conditions: 
1. Identify all orange pixels.
2. For each orange pixel:
    - Check if it's adjacent to at least one white (0) pixel.
    - And, Check if the orange pixel is part of a contiguous orange group of 3 or greater in any one direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal)
    - If both conditions are met, change the orange pixel to white.
3. Output the modified grid, preserving orange pixels that don't meet the removal criteria.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
