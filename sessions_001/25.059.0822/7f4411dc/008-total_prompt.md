1. Identify Orange Pixels: Locate all pixels with the color orange (value 7).
2. Check for White Neighbors: For *each* orange pixel, determine if ANY of its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) are white (value 0).
3. Contiguous Length Check If an orange pixel is adjacent to a white, determine the maximum contiguous length of orange in any direction.
4. Conditional Removal: If an orange pixel *is* adjacent to a white pixel *and* the maximum contiguous length is three or greater, change the orange pixel to white (0); otherwise, leave the orange pixel unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. The results from executing on other examples in the training set reveal discrepancies between the expected outputs and produced outputs. This suggests the initial program doesn't capture the full transformation rule, and we need to learn from all the examples, not just the first.

The core issue is that only orange is considered. A more generalized rule
applies. My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each example's input, expected output, and actual output. Note specific cells where the transformation differs.
2.  **Identify Missed Patterns:** Determine what patterns or rules the current code *fails* to capture.
3.  **Generalize the Program:** Revise the natural language program to incorporate these missing elements, making it more general and accurate across all examples.
4.  **Focus on Contiguous groups:** The contiguous group check is good, but it is too focused.

**Example and Results Analysis**

I need to understand *why* some pixels change and others don't. I need to examine the size of the contiguous groups to find the right threshold.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
