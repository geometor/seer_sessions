Both grids have the same dimensions (6x2 in the provided text representation, and visibly similar in the images, although I can not determine their exact shape). The grids contain single-digit integers, each representing a color (as defined by the `COLOR_MAP` in the initial instructions). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in height of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
