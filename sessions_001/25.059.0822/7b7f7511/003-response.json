The input grid appears to be transformed into a smaller output grid. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (1, 2, and 3, corresponding to blue, red, and green, respectively). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the dimensions of the grid, specifically, removing columns.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
