<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1152x720 at 0x70A2EC7D7750>Okay, I've reviewed the provided input-output pairs. Here's my analysis of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception:**

The core transformation appears to be a reduction in the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be a vertically or horizontally truncated version of the input grid. The colors and their relative positions within the remaining portion are preserved. The truncation appears consistent: either the right half of the input or the bottom half of the input is removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: dimension_reduction
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - cells:
          type: integer
          values: [0-9] # Representing colors
actions:
  - name: truncate
    description: Remove a portion of the grid along either rows or columns.
    parameters:
      - axis: [row, column]
      - amount: integer # Number of rows or columns to remove
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Preserved relative positions of colors within the remaining grid after truncation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Determine the dimensions** of the input grid (number of rows and columns).
2. **Determine the dimensions** of the output grid.
3. **Compare** the dimensions
   * If input grid width > output grid width, the input is truncated horizontally to create output width.
   * if input grid height > output grid height, the input is truncated vertically to create output height.
4. **Truncate** the input grid.
   - If the input width is greater than output width, keep the leftmost columns that match output width.
   - If the input height is greater than output height, keep the topmost rows that match output height.
5. **Output** the truncated grid.

Essentially, the program describes a simple cropping operation, removing either columns from the right or rows from the bottom, retaining the top-left portion of the input grid that corresponds to output dimensions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
