Here's my analysis of the task, including my perception, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe core transformation appears to be a reduction in the dimensions of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be a vertically or horizontally truncated version of the input grid. The colors and their relative positions within the remaining portion are preserved. The truncation appears consistent: either the right half of the input or the bottom half of the input is removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
