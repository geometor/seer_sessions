**input:**
```
2 3
3 2
4 4
2 3
3 2
4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x384 at 0x70A2EC7D4250>

**output:**
```
2 3
3 2
4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x192 at 0x70A2EC7D5CD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids have the same dimensions (6x2 in the provided text representation, and visibly similar in the images, although I can not determine their exact shape). The grids contain single-digit integers, each representing a color (as defined by the `COLOR_MAP` in the initial instructions). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in height of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x2
      - values: [2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 4]
      - colors: [red, green, green, red, yellow, yellow, red, green, green, red, yellow, yellow]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x2
      - values: [2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 4]
      - colors: [red, green, green, red, yellow, yellow]

actions:
  - name: reduce_height
    description: The height of the input grid is reduced by a factor of 2.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: height_reduction
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by reducing its height. The output grid consists of the top half of the input grid, meaning every other row from input is taken and outputted as the solution.

Specifically, the program takes rows from the input grid at indices 0, 1, and 2, and then constructs the entire output grid from them.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
