Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to remove the last column of the input grid. The width is reduced by 1, but keep all rows.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert input grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # Get the number of columns in the input grid
    num_cols = input_array.shape[1]
    
    # Create a list of column indices to keep (all except the last one)
    cols_to_keep = list(range(num_cols - 1))
    
    # Use array slicing to select the columns to keep
    output_array = input_array[:, cols_to_keep]
    
    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()
    
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on a single example, which led to an oversimplification. While the initial hypothesis (removing the last column) was correct for the first training example, it's clearly not universally applicable to all examples in the training set. The provided results demonstrate this, as some examples showed differences between expected output and actual output. The strategy now is to review all training examples, identify where the initial hypothesis breaks down, and develop a more comprehensive rule that accounts for the variations observed across all examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's an analysis of the training examples. Since I'm in the dreamer phase, I will focus on observations, descriptions, and high level attributes rather than code specifics. I can generate lists of facts about each input-output pair, and build a story about those.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid
    *   Output: 3x2 grid
    *   Observation: The last column (all blue) was removed. Initial hypothesis holds.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid
    *   Output: 5x4 grid
    *   Observation: The last column (all blue) was removed. Initial hypothesis holds.
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: 9x9 grid.
    *    Output: 9x8 grid
    *    Observation: Last Column (all blue) was removed. Initial hypothesis holds.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_shape: 3x3
    output_shape: 3x2
    removed_column_color: blue
    column_removed: true
  - example_id: 2
    input_shape: 5x5
    output_shape: 5x4
    removed_column_color: blue
    column_removed: true
  - example_id: 3
    input_shape: 9x9
    output_shape: 9x8
    removed_column_color: blue
    column_removed: true
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to remove the right-most column from the input grid to produce the output grid. The removed column appears to contain pixels of the same color, although that is an observation and may or not be relevant. The height of the grid remains unchanged, and the width decreases by one.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
