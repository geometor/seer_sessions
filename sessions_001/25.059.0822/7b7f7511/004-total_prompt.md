**input:**
```

1 1 3 3 1 1 3 3
3 3 1 1 3 3 1 1
2 3 1 1 2 3 1 1
```

**output:**
```

2 3 1 1
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares. The input grid appears to be transformed into a smaller output grid. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (1, 2, and 3, corresponding to blue, red, and green, respectively). The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the dimensions of the grid, specifically, removing columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - cells: color_values (integers)
    relations:
      - adjacent: (up, down, left, right)

actions:
  - type: column_removal
    details: removes specific columns from the grid

observations:
  - input_grid_dimensions: (4, 8)
  - output_grid_dimensions: (4, 4)
  - removed_columns : [4,5,6,7,8] #from right and [1,2,3,4] from left? Neither. [5,7] perhaps
  - color_values: [1, 2, 3]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to remove every other column starting on the right and moving towards the left, or starting at column 5 and deleting every other column. In this example, take the original input and create a new grid, keeping columns 1, 2, 3, and 4, skipping 5, keeping 6, and skipping 7.

Alternatively, the last four columns are removed. And of those remaining four, only keep columns 1,3,5,7,

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
