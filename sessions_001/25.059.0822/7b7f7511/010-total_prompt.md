**input:**
```
4 4 4 4 4 4
6 4 8 6 4 8
6 6 8 6 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x70A2F47C7DD0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
6 4 8
6 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70A2F47C7BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares. The primary change I observe is a reduction in the width of the grid.  The colors and their arrangement seem to be preserved, but the grid is "compressed" horizontally. The height remains the same.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      columns_input: 6
      columns_output: 3
      cells:
        - color: yellow # 4
        - color: magenta # 6
        - color: azure # 8
    relations:
      - type: spatial
        description: colors arranged in rows and columns

actions:
  - type: compression
    description: Horizontal reduction of the grid's width.
    details: The number of columns is halved.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid and its dimensions (rows and columns).
2.  **Observe** the color of each cell in the input grid.
3.  **Create** a new grid with the same number of rows as the input grid, but with half the number of columns.
4.  **Maintain original height.**
5.  **Copy** the color values from the input grid to the output grid, preserving the row and column arrangement as relative to original width. Specifically, the first column on output corresponds to the first column in input. Each column `i` in the output grid corresponds to the column `i` in the input grid.

In essence, the transformation takes every column from original, and eliminates the n-1 columns following to the end.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
