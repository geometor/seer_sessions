Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to reduce the width of the grid by half, keeping the height the same. 
The colors and their relative arrangements are preserved. Each column `i` in the output grid 
corresponds to the column `i` in the input grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get dimensions of the input grid
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])

    # Calculate the new number of columns (half of the original)
    new_cols = cols // 2

    # Initialize the output grid with the new dimensions, filled with zeros
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, new_cols), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the rows and new columns
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(new_cols):
            # Copy the corresponding cell value from the input grid
            output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
