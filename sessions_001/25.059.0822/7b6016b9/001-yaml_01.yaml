facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 2D grids.
  - observation: Grid cells contain digits 0-9, representing colors.
  - observation: Contiguous same-color cells form shapes.
  - observation: A background color exists.
  - observation: A consistent color transformation occurs.
  - object: shapes
    properties:
