      This grid has two yellow objects and only one is filled.
      The code does seem to recognize multiple objects, and it fills
      the background correctly. The object fill fails.

  - example_3:
    input_grid_shape: (9, 9)
    output_grid_shape: (9, 9)
    objects_identified:
      - type: yellow_object

    transformation_result: incorrect
    msg: >
        The object filling has failed. The correct number of objects are
        identified, and the colors are correct, but the fill operation is
        incorrect.
