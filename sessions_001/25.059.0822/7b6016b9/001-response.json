The mapping is provided in the prompt.\n*   **Shapes:** Within the grids, contiguous blocks of the same color form shapes.\n*   **Background:** There's often a dominant \"background\" color, usually white (0) or another light color.\n*    **Overlay/Fill:** It appears the transformation involves some kind of overlay or fill operation, replacing parts of existing shapes with new colors or creating new shapes on top.\n*   **Color Changes:** The core of the transformation seems to involve changing the colors of certain pixels based on some rule related to existing shapes or patterns.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification**\n\n"
