There are distinct horizontal and vertical lines of blue (1) pixels.\n*   **Output:** The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input. Black (0) pixels have been replaced with green (3), blue (1) pixels remain blue, and there are some new red(2) pixels replacing blue in one part of the image.\n*   **Transformation:** It seems that the transformation involves changing the colors of certain pixels based on their original color and possibly their neighbors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
