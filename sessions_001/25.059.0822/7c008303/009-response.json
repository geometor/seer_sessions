The input grid appears to be larger and more complex than the output grid. There's a noticeable reduction in size and a change in the arrangement and colors of the pixels. The colors present in the input are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow(4), and azure (8). The output grid contains only white, blue, red and yellow. Some colors like azure and green from the input are completely gone in output. The input grid has regions of single colors and the third row is completely azure.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Preserve relative positions and create an object of shape 3x2.\n    * Create another object using only yellow colored object from the top right, but only those which are in contact with blue. Preserve locations relative to each other.\n\n4.  **Assemble Output:** Reconstruct the remaining pixels into output grid. From observation, we see the objects from extraction are placed according to relative location:\n    * object(blue and red) goes to rows 0,1 and 2. Red pixels fill columns 3 and 5, blue fill columns 0 and 1.\n    * The second yellow extracted object is placed at row 4 and columns 0,1,2.\n\n5.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** The rest of the pixels are filled with white(0).\n"
