The selection criteria are based on adjacency: blue and red are selected together if adjacent, and yellow is selected if adjacent to blue. Azure and green objects are always removed. The output grid size is determined by a bounding box around selected objects, plus one row/col on top and left, and filled with black.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid, colors):\n    \"\"\"Find objects of specified colors in the grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if not visited[r, c] and grid[r, c] in colors:\n                obj = []\n                stack = [(r, c)]\n                visited[r, c] = True\n\n                while stack:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = stack.pop()\n                    obj.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n\n                    neighbors = [\n                        (curr_r - 1, curr_c),\n                        (curr_r + 1, curr_c),\n                        (curr_r, curr_c - 1),\n                        (curr_r, curr_c + 1),\n                    ]\n                    for nr, nc in neighbors:\n                        if (\n                            0 <= nr < rows\n                            and 0 <= nc < cols\n                            and not visited[nr, nc]\n                            and grid[nr, nc] == grid[r, c]\n                        ):\n                            stack.append((nr, nc))\n                            visited[nr, nc] = True\n                objects.append(obj)\n    return objects\n\ndef are_adjacent(object1, object2):\n    \"\"\"Checks if two objects are adjacent.\"\"\"\n    for r1, c1 in object1:\n        for r2, c2 in object2:\n            if abs(r1 - r2) <= 1 and abs(c1 - c2) <= 1 and (abs(r1-r2) + abs(c1-c2) == 1):\n                return True\n    return False\n\ndef get_bounding_box(objects):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the bounding box for a list of objects.\"\"\"\n    if not objects:\n        return (0, 0, 0, 0)\n\n    min_r, min_c = float('inf'), float('inf')\n    max_r, max_c = float('-inf'), float('-inf')\n\n    for obj in objects:\n        for r, c in obj:\n            min_r = min(min_r, r)\n            min_c = min(min_c, c)\n            max_r = max(max_r, r)\n            max_c = max(max_c, c)\n\n    return (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # 1.
