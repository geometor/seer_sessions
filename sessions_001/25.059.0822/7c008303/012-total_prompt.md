Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it correctly identified the extraction and repositioning of blue, red, and yellow objects. However, it's clear from the test results that the logic for determining the positions and presence of these objects needs refinement. Specifically, the relative positioning calculations are not universally applicable across all examples, the selection criteria are overly narrow (only top-right), and it doesn't generalize to different shapes of the color blocks.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Object Identification:** Improve the object identification logic (`find_objects`) to correctly identify contiguous blocks of the same color, regardless of their location in the input grid. This is already implemented, but ensure it is correctly finding them.
2.  **Generalized Selection Criteria:** Instead of assuming top-right corner, identify the relevant objects (blue, red, yellow) based on rules applicable to ALL examples. The adjacency/contact relationship between blue and yellow should be consistent across inputs and outputs.
3.  **Relative Positioning:** Determine a more robust method for calculating the output positions. The relative position is not based on original row, col, but likely based on a top-left position in a bounding box of the input shape.
4. **Output grid size**: establish a consistent method of determining the size of the output grid.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**
I will analyze metrics from the output grids to test assumptions about object selection, transformation logic, and expected values.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of blue, red, yellow, azure, and green pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Select Objects:**
    *   Select the blue object if and only if it is adjacent to a red object.
    *   Select the red object if and only if it is adjacent to a blue object.
    * Select the yellow object if and only if at least one of its pixels is adjacent to a pixel of a selected blue object.
    *   Discard any azure and green objects.
3.  **Determine Output Grid Size**:
    * Create a bounding box of all the selected objects
    * output grid will have +1 row on top, + 1 col on left
4.  **Position Selected Objects:**
    *   Iterate through the pixels of the *selected* blue, red and yellow objects.
    *   Place the selected objects' pixels in the output grid.
    *   The relative location of each pixel in the output grid should be determined by the position of each object pixel, relative to the top,left of the selected object's bounding box, +1 row and +1 col

5.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** Fill any remaining (unoccupied) cells in the output grid with black (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
