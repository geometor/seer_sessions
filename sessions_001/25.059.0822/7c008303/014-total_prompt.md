```python
"""
The transformation extracts specific color blocks (blue, red, and yellow) from the input grid and places them into the output grid. The selection criteria are based on adjacency: blue and red are selected together if adjacent, and yellow is selected if adjacent to blue. Azure and green objects are always removed. The output grid size is determined by a bounding box around selected objects, plus one row/col on top and left, and filled with black.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observing only the first training example.  The subsequent tests reveal that the initial assumptions were too narrow. The code correctly handles the first example but fails on others, indicating the selection logic and potentially the object identification are incomplete or incorrect.  The strategy to resolve this is:

1. **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the objects present, their colors, their spatial relationships (adjacency, containment, etc.), and how they are represented in the output. Note where the current code succeeds and fails.
2. **Refine Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function seems to work based on simple contiguity of color.  This is likely correct, but we must ensure all relevant objects are found.
3. **Revise Selection Logic:** The core issue is likely the `transform` function's selection logic. The current rule (select adjacent blue and red, and yellow adjacent to blue) is too specific. We need a more general rule based on the observations.
4. **Bounding Box and Placement:** The bounding box logic generally seems correct (add a black border around). But verify after revising logic.
5. **Iterate:** After revising the natural language program and code, re-test against all examples.

**Example Metrics and Results**

Here's a breakdown of each example, using the current code's results as a starting point. I will leverage the given results from the previous execution.

*   **Example 1:** `train:0` - **SUCCESS**
    *   Input: Contains adjacent blue, red, and yellow objects. Also has azure and green.
    *   Output: Correctly extracts the blue, red, and yellow objects, placing them in a black-bordered rectangle.
    * Observation: Initial selection logic works for this case.

*   **Example 2:** `train:1` - **FAILURE**
    * Input: Contains blue and red objects that are *not* adjacent, and a separate, isolated yellow object.
    * Expected Output: The blue, red and yellow are in the output.
    * Current Output: The output is all black (no objects selected).
    * Observation: Adjacency requirement between blue and red is too restrictive. It appears all three colors are extracted even when not adjacent.

* **Example 3:** `train:2` - **FAILURE**
    * Input: Has blue object with a red object above it, yellow object to the right of the blue object
    * Expected Output: blue, red and yellow objects selected
    * Current output: All black
    * Observation: Adjacency seems to be working, but maybe not fully.

* **Example 4:** `train:3` - **FAILURE**
    * Input: Has blue object with a red object *inside* it and the yellow one space away.
    * Expected output: All three are selected.
    * Actual output: All black
    * Observation: The current code doesn't handle containment.

      - color: red
      - color: yellow
    selection_rule: "Select blue, red, and yellow objects regardless of adjacency or containment."
    border: black
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of blue, red, and yellow pixels in the input grid. Ignore objects of other colors (azure, green, etc.).
2.  **Select Objects:** Select *all* identified blue, red, and yellow objects, regardless of their spatial relationship (adjacency or containment).
3.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the bounding box that encompasses all selected objects. Add one row and one column of padding on all sides (top, bottom, left, right).
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid with the calculated dimensions, filled with black (color 0).
5.  **Place Objects:** Copy the selected blue, red, and yellow objects into the output grid, maintaining their relative positions within the bounding box, but shifted by one row and col due to the padding.

The key change is removing the adjacency requirement and always selecting blue, red, and yellow objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
