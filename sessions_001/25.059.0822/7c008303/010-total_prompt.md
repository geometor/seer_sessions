Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be larger and more complex than the output grid. There's a noticeable reduction in size and a change in the arrangement and colors of the pixels. The colors present in the input are white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow(4), and azure (8). The output grid contains only white, blue, red and yellow. Some colors like azure and green from the input are completely gone in output. The input grid has regions of single colors and the third row is completely azure.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
    
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x6
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 4]
      
  - name: azure_region
    type: object
    properties:
      color: 8
      location: input_grid.row(2) #row index 2, all columns
      shape: rectangle

  - name: green_region
    type: object
    properties:
      color: 3
      shape: multiple sub_regions

  - name: blue_red_object_topright
    type: object
    properties:
      colors: [1,2]
      relative_location: top_right #input grid
    relation: adjacent

actions:
  - type: reduction
    description: input grid is reduced to output_grid
  - type: color_filtering
    description: some colors(3,8) get removed
  - type: object_extraction
    description: Extract specific arrangements/color blocks from the input to form output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** In the input grid, locate the contiguous azure (8) region which makes up the entire third row, the green objects/regions and a block of blue(1), yellow(4) and red(2) pixels in the top-right corner.

2. **Color Elimination:** Remove all azure(8) and green(3) colored pixels.

3.  **Object Extraction:**
    *   Extract the blue (1) and red (2) pixels from the top-right corner of input grid. Preserve relative positions and create an object of shape 3x2.
    * Create another object using only yellow colored object from the top right, but only those which are in contact with blue. Preserve locations relative to each other.

4.  **Assemble Output:** Reconstruct the remaining pixels into output grid. From observation, we see the objects from extraction are placed according to relative location:
    * object(blue and red) goes to rows 0,1 and 2. Red pixels fill columns 3 and 5, blue fill columns 0 and 1.
    * The second yellow extracted object is placed at row 4 and columns 0,1,2.

5.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** The rest of the pixels are filled with white(0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
