    description: The input grid's information is reduced and represented in the output grid.
    details: >-
      Specific regions in the input map to individual pixels in the output.
      The upper-left pixel of each region appears to the the representative color of the output region.

relationships:
  - input_to_output_mapping:  Regions of the input grid map to individual pixels of the output grid. Specifically, The 3x2 region of input is reduced to 2x2 block of output
