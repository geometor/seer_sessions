            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a larger, more complex grid (input) into a smaller, simplified grid (output). The input grid contains a variety of colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, focusing on specific colors and their relative positions. There's a clear reduction in both dimensions and the number of distinct colors. The input grid appears to have some repeated patterns or shapes, particularly with the azure (8) and green (3) colors. The output grid contains only white(0), red(2), yellow(4), gray(5) and magenta(6).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

First two rows of the output grid contain red(2) followed by two zeros and then yellow(4).\n3.  **Scattered Color Replacement:** The scattered green (3) pixels in the input grid seem to relate to the positions of gray (5) and magenta (6) colors.\n4.  **Color Position Mapping:**\n    *   The azure(8) color is mapped to red(2) and yellow(4) color. The leftmost column containing 8 is mapped to 2, and third column is mapped to 4. The relative postion from top is maintained.\n    *   The green(3) color is mapped to gray(5) and magenta(6).\n    *   The colors red(2), yellow(4), magenta(6) and gray(5) are mapped to themseves maintaining relative input position.\n5. Dimension Reduction: Reduce the input grid from 9X9 to output 6X6 grid while perserving the original locations of the colors.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts specific colors from the input, maps them to new colors in the output and simplified grid while attempting to preserve relative positions.\n"
