<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1856x1040 at 0x70A2ECD5DC50>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided task example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into a smaller grid of colored pixels. The input grids appear to have a consistent large horizontal line of azure (8) pixels. There seem to be multiple separate colored regions above and/or below this line in the input which get reduced to 2x2 blocks of the same color in the output grid. It appears the colors and relative positions from input is maintained in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels.
  - observation: Input grids contain distinct colored regions above and below the azure line.
  - observation: Output grids maintain the colors of the distinct regions from the input.
  - observation: Output grids reduce each distinct colored region to a 2x2 block, or to 2 in line if next to grid border.
  - observation: the position relative to each other and border of distinct regions is maintained.
  - relationship: Output grid dimensions are smaller and seemingly related to the number of distinct colored regions in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Line:** Locate the horizontal line of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. This line serves as a separator.

2.  **Segment Regions:** Identify distinct contiguous colored regions above and below the azure line. Consider pixels of the same color connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same region.

3.  **Reduce to 2x2 blocks:**
    *   For the top-left most member of a region, determine it's coordinates
    *   In the output array, for the coordinates, map a reduced representation:
    *   If it is next to the grid boundaries, just output the color id in that cell.
    *   If it is next to one of the grid boundaries, just output a size two of the color id in that direction.
    *   Otherwise create a 2x2 block of same color

4.  **Maintain Relative Position:** Ensure the reduced 2x2 blocks in the output grid maintain the relative positions (above/below, left/right) of the original regions in the input grid.

5. fill empty coordinates with zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
