The input grids appear to have a consistent large horizontal line of azure (8) pixels. There seem to be multiple separate colored regions above and/or below this line in the input which get reduced to 2x2 blocks of the same color in the output grid. It appears the colors and relative positions from input is maintained in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This line serves as a separator.\n\n2.  **Segment Regions:** Identify distinct contiguous colored regions above and below the azure line. Consider pixels of the same color connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally as part of the same region.\n\n3.  **Reduce to 2x2 blocks:**\n    *   For the top-left most member of a region, determine it's coordinates\n    *   In the output array, for the coordinates, map a reduced representation:\n    *   If it is next to the grid boundaries, just output the color id in that cell.\n    *   If it is next to one of the grid boundaries, just output a size two of the color id in that direction.\n    *   Otherwise create a 2x2 block of same color\n\n4.  **Maintain Relative Position:** Ensure the reduced 2x2 blocks in the output grid maintain the relative positions (above/below, left/right) of the original regions in the input grid.\n\n5. fill empty coordinates with zeros.\n"
