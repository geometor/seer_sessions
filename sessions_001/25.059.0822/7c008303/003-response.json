The colors in the input grid seem to be grouped into rectangular regions. The output grid appears to have a reduced resolution, with each pixel potentially representing a condensed version of a corresponding region in the input. The output grid seems to consolidate colors from specific regions of the input, taking on a representative value/color from a group of input values.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
