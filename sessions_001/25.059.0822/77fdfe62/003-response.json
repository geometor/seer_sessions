The input grid appears to contain several distinct objects, identifiable by color (represented by different digits). The output grid seems to represent a simplified version of the input, retaining only certain key features or a summary of the original objects. The transformation involves a reduction in both size and detail. It appears that only the corner pixels are somehow extracted.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The placement depends on the position of the corner within each object and the object's relative position to the borders of the input grid. Specifically:\n    *   Top-left corner pixels of objects go in the top-left quadrant of output.\n    *   Top-right corner pixels in top-right.\n    *   Bottom-left in bottom-left.\n    *   Bottom-right in bottom-right.\n    *   The positioning appears to maintain relative positioning within each quadrant.\n    *   Empty (white, 0) parts of the input result in an empty output quadrant.\n\n5.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with 0 (white).\n"
