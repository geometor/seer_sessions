An object is defined as a group of connected pixels of the same color, excluding black (color 0). Connectivity is defined by the 4 cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n\n2. Find Top-Left Corner: For each identified object, determine the coordinates of its top-left corner. This is the pixel within the object that has the smallest row and column indices.\n\n3. Sort by Horizontal Position: Sort the identified objects based on the horizontal position (column index) of their top-left corners. Objects with top-left corners further to the left come first.\n\n4. Create Output Grid: Construct a new 1xN grid, where N is the number of distinct objects found.\n\n5. Populate Output: Iterate through the sorted objects. For each object, get the color of its top-left corner pixel. Place this color value into the output grid at the corresponding index (starting from 0).\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds distinct objects in the grid.\n    Returns a list of objects, where each object is a list of (row, col) coordinates.\n    \"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r, c] != 0:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], current_object)\n                objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef find_top_left_corner(object_coords):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the top-left corner coordinates of an object.\n    Returns a tuple (row, col).\n    \"\"\"\n    min_row = min(r for r, _ in object_coords)\n    min_col = min(c for _, c in object_coords)\n    return (min_row, min_col)\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Find distinct objects\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n\n    # Find top-left corners for each object\n    top_left_corners = [find_top_left_corner(obj) for obj in objects]\n\n    # Create output grid: height 1, width = number of objects\n    num_objects = len(objects)\n    output_grid = np.zeros((1, num_objects), dtype=int)\n\n    # Sort objects based on the horizontal position of their top-left corners\n    sorted_objects = sorted(zip(objects, top_left_corners), key=lambda x: x[1][1])\n\n\n    # Populate output grid\n    for i, (obj, (r, c)) in enumerate(sorted_objects):\n        color = input_grid[r, c]\n        output_grid[0, i] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
