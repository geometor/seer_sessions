Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (8x8) into a smaller grid (4x4). The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from specific locations within the input grid, with some summarization or selection process occurring. There's an apparent spatial relationship: quadrants or 2x2 blocks within the input might map to single pixels in the output. The colors magenta (6), red (2), orange (7) and yellow (4) are prominent in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)

observations:
  - The input grid is divided into sixteen 2x2 subgrids.
  - Each 2x2 subgrid in the input grid corresponds to a single pixel in the output_grid.
  - output_grid[0,0] derives its value (6) from the top-left corner pixel from the top left 2x2 block of the input grid, input_grid[0,0].
  - output_grid[0,1] derives its value from pixel[0,6] from the 2x2 block input_grid[0:2, 6:8]
  - output_grid[0,2] comes from pixel[0,7]
  - output_grid[0,3] comes from pixel[0,1]
  - output_grid[1,0] comes from pixel[0,0]
  - output_grid[1,1] comes from pixel[0,1]
  - output_grid[1,2] comes from pixel[0,6]
  - output_grid[1,3] comes from pixel[0,7]
  - output_grid[2,0] comes from pixel[7,0]
  - output_grid[2,1] comes from pixel[7,1]
  - output_grid[2,2] comes from pixel[7,6]
  - output_grid[2,3] comes from pixel[7,7]
  - output_grid[3,0] comes from pixel[7,0]
  - output_grid[3,1] comes from pixel[7,1]
  - output_grid[3,2] comes from pixel[7,6]
  - output_grid[3,3] comes from pixel[7,7]
  - the top-left pixel of each block

  - The output grid appears to extract specific colors from the corners of four 4x4 blocks in the input_grid
relationships:
  - spatial_mapping: input_grid (2x2 subgrids) -> output_grid (single pixels)

actions:
  - selection: Specific pixels from the input grid appear to determine the output_grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. Divide the 8x8 input grid into sixteen non-overlapping 2x2 subgrids.
2.  For each 2x2 block:
    - Get the value of the pixel at the top-left corner of the subgrid.
    - Assign this value to corresponding pixel in the 4x4 output_grid.

In essence, the program takes each 2x2 block and outputs to a corresponding location the upper left corner of each 2x2 block.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
