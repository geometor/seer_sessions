Previous Code:
```python
"""
Divide the 8x8 input grid into sixteen non-overlapping 2x2 subgrids.  For each 2x2 block, get the value of the pixel at the top-left corner of the subgrid and assign this value to the corresponding pixel in the 4x4 output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a 4x4 array filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through the 2x2 subgrids of the input grid.
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(4):
            # Extract the top-left pixel value of each 2x2 subgrid.
            output_grid[i, j] = input_grid[i * 2, j * 2]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
