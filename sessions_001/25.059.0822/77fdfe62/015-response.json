The colors in the output grid seem to be derived from specific locations within the input grid, with some summarization or selection process occurring. There's an apparent spatial relationship: quadrants or 2x2 blocks within the input might map to single pixels in the output. The colors magenta (6), red (2), orange (7) and yellow (4) are prominent in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
