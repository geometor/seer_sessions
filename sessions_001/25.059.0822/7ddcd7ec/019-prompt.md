Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the 2x2 Orange Square:** Find the contiguous 2x2 square of orange (color 7) pixels within the input grid. This square serves as an anchor point. The position is recorded as the top-left pixel of the square.

2.  **Create Pixels/Columns Relative to Corners:**
    *   **Top-Left Corner:** Create a single orange pixel directly above and to the left of the top-left corner of the 2x2 square.
    *   **Bottom-Left Corner:** Create a single orange pixel directly below and to the left of the *bottom*-left corner of the 2x2 square.
    *   **Top-Right Corner:** Create a 2x1 orange *column* of pixels directly above and to the right of the *top*-right corner of the 2x2 square.

3. **No changes to original 2x2 square** The 2x2 block remains in place.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
