task: 6cf79866
description: |
  The task involves cropping an image to its smallest bounding box. The bounding box includes all non-white pixels.
objects:
  - id: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0-9]  # All colors are possible
      width: [1-30]
      height: [1-30]
  - id: non_white_pixels
    type: object_group
    properties:
      color: != 0  # Any color except white
      contiguous: False  # The non-white pixels do not have to form a single block
  - id: bounding_box
    type: rectangle
    properties:
      top: int     # Row index of top edge
      bottom: int  # Row index of bottom edge
      left: int    # Column index of left edge
      right: int   # Column index of right edge
    defined_by: non_white_pixels # The bounding box is defined by the extent of non-white pixels
  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [0-9]
      width: derived #width of bounding box
      height: derived #height of bounding box
    derived_from: [input_grid, bounding_box]

actions:
  - name: find_bounding_box
    input: input_grid
    output: bounding_box
    description: |
       Locates the smallest rectangle enclosing all non-white pixels within the input_grid.
  - name: crop_grid
    input: [input_grid, bounding_box]
    output: output_grid
    description: |
      Extracts the section of input_grid defined by bounding_box, producing the output_grid.
