Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program description:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A large grid (18x22) with colored pixels. There are distinct regions of uniform color: yellow (4), azure (8), green (3), blue (1), red (2), and white (0).
*   **Output:** A much smaller grid (2x3) with the colors yellow, azure, and green in the top row, blue, red, and azure in the bottom row.
* **Dominant Transformation**: The input's colored regions seem to be represented as single pixels in the output. It's like a "summary" or "representative sampling" of the main colors present, and appears to be the top left pixel of each color.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 18x22
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
    description: Contains regions of uniform color.

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      size: 2x3
      colors: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 8]
    description: Represents a compressed version of the input grid.

  - relation: color_mapping
    description: Each distinct color in the input grid appears to be represented by a single pixel in the output grid.

  - relation: spatial_representation
    description:  The top-leftmost pixel of each color in the input is chosen to represent that color, and those are arranged in a consistent 2x3 layout in output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Distinct Colored Regions:** Scan the input grid and identify all contiguous regions of uniform color. Consider a region as a group of one or more pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent (not diagonal).
2.  **Find Representative Pixel:** For each distinct colored region, find the top-left most pixel. Record its color.
3.  **Construct Output Grid from Input Grid Top-left Pixel Colors**:
    *   The first three unique colors, arranged top to bottom, left to right, from their top-left pixel, form the top row of the output
    *   the next three, arranged the same, form the bottom row of the output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
