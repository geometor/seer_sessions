    properties:
      - colors: multiple (from COLOR_MAP)
      - regions: rectangular, single-color, variable size, variable number
      - boundaries: defined by color 0 (white) pixels
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: subset of input_grid colors
      - size: smaller than input_grid, 2xN
      - regions: rectangular blocks derived and positioned non-trivially from input regions.

actions:
  - type: identify_regions
    description: Detect rectangular regions of uniform color in the input grid, bounded by color 0.
  - type: extract_colors
    description: Extract the color of each identified region.
  - type: arrange colors
