The input grids appear to be divided into distinct rectangular regions, each filled with a single color. The colors used are from the provided `COLOR_MAP`. The output grid seems to represent a summary of the input, showing a simplified arrangement of colors, it contains a subset of colors of input. Crucially, the output grid is not just a scaled down version, the positions of the colored rectangles changes. The size and number of regions within the input vary across examples. The dividing lines between the areas are always where blank/white (0) pixels meet.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

A region is defined as a contiguous block of pixels sharing the same color, and bounded by pixels of color 0 (white) or the edge of the grid.\n\n2. **Extract Representative Colors:** For each identified region, record the color value (0-9) of that region.\n\n3.  **Construct Output Grid:** create the output grid with dimensions 2xN, where N the number of distinct pairs of colors, with the pairs separated by blank/white (0) lines in the input grid.\n\n4.  **Position Colors:** for each pair of regions identified in step 1, one is placed above the other in order of their discovery, and colored using the representative color identified in Step 2.\n"
