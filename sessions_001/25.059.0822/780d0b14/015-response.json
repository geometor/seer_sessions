The output is a much smaller grid, seemingly summarizing or representing key features of the input. The input grid appears to be divided into distinct rectangular regions of uniform color. It also contains horizontal \"bands\" of solid colors. The output grid seems to capture the color of large, distinct regions present in the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this example, there are six such regions, each defined by the intersection of horizontal and vertical \"bands\" of colors.\n2. **Extract Colors:** For each identified region, determine its color (the single integer value present in all cells of that region).\n3. **Construct Output:** Create a smaller output grid (3x2 in this case). Fill each cell of the output grid with the color of the corresponding input region. The output seems to maintain the spatial relationship between the input regions (top-left region color goes to the top-left, etc.).\n4. **Ordering:** Create pairs of the regions identified by combining, top-to-bottom then left-to-right.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies large rectangular blocks of uniform color in the input and represents them as single colored cells in a smaller output grid, preserving the relative spatial arrangement.\n"
