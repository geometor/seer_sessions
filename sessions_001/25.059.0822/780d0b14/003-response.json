Here's my breakdown of the input and output, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe input appears to be a large grid (20x20) composed of four distinct colored regions: blue (1), azure (8), magenta (6), and white (0). These regions seem to form large, somewhat irregular blocks. The output is a much smaller 2x2 grid containing the numbers 1, 8, 6, and 1, which correspond to blue, azure, and magenta colors from the input grid. The white color (0) is not represented in output. The output grid appears to summarize or represent the larger input grid in some way related to the arrangement of the colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
