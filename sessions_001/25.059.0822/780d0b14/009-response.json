Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program description:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A large grid (18x22) with colored pixels. There are distinct regions of uniform color: yellow (4), azure (8), green (3), blue (1), red (2), and white (0).\n*   **Output:** A much smaller grid (2x3) with the colors yellow, azure, and green in the top row, blue, red, and azure in the bottom row.\n* **Dominant Transformation**: The input's colored regions seem to be represented as single pixels in the output. It's like a \"summary\" or \"representative sampling\" of the main colors present, and appears to be the top left pixel of each color.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Consider a region as a group of one or more pixels of the same color that are directly adjacent (not diagonal).\n2.  **Find Representative Pixel:** For each distinct colored region, find the top-left most pixel. Record its color.\n3.  **Construct Output Grid from Input Grid Top-left Pixel Colors**:\n    *   The first three unique colors, arranged top to bottom, left to right, from their top-left pixel, form the top row of the output\n    *   the next three, arranged the same, form the bottom row of the output.\n\n"
