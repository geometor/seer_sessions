Find the '8' on the first row. For each '8' on the first row, change the '0' below it to '8'.\n4.  **Yellow shape** remains unchanged.\n\nIn simpler terms, the azure shape expands to fill in empty (0) with the same color. The expansion happens specifically to the right side for some pixels on the top row, and fill down. The yellow shape doesn't change.\n"
