Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and yellow (4). There's a clear alteration in the arrangement of the azure (8) pixels between the input and output, while the yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged. The azure pixels appear to be 'moving' or being 'redrawn' based on some rule related to their original positions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x9
      - cell_values: [0-9] representing colors
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x9
      - cell_values: [0-9] representing colors
  - type: object_group
    name: azure_pixels
    properties:
      - color: 8 (azure)
    relations:
      - in: input_grid
      - in: output_grid
  - type: object_group
    name: yellow_pixels
    properties:
      - color: 4 (yellow)
    relations:
      - in: input_grid
      - in: output_grid

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: "Rearrangement of azure pixels based on a specific rule; yellow pixels remain static."
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: positional
    description: "Azure pixels in the output grid are positioned relative to their initial positions in the input_grid."
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Yellow:** Maintain the exact positions of all yellow (4) pixels in the output grid.
3. **Transform Azure**:
    *   Observe the contiguous "L" shape azure block on the top.
    *   Recreate the same size "L" shape, but fill empty space on the left and right of original "L" shape.
    *   All other azure pixels become white.

In simpler terms, the transformation replicates the yellow pixels and restructures the 3 azure pixels.
