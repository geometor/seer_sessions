Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the contiguous blocks of azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels.
2.  **Focus on Azure Shape:** Analyze the azure shape.
3.  **Expansion Rule:**, find all the '0' on the first row that are adjacent to '8', change it to '8'. Find the '8' on the first row. For each '8' on the first row, change the '0' below it to '8'.
4.  **Yellow shape** remains unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on the azure (8) color and its expansion. However, the code only considered downward and rightward expansion. The provided examples clearly show that the expansion of the azure color is more comprehensive, filling in all adjacent '0's, effectively "flooding" or "filling" contiguous regions of zeros that are connected to the initial azure shape. The yellow shape remains constant, acting as a boundary in examples.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Expansion Logic:** The core issue is the limited expansion. Instead of only expanding down and right, we need to implement a "flood fill" type of expansion. This means that any '0' adjacent to an '8' should become an '8', and this process should continue iteratively until no more '0's adjacent to '8's are found.

2.  **Preserve Yellow Shape:** The current implementation correctly leaves yellow (4) unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: azure (8)
    behavior: expands to fill adjacent '0' cells
    initial_shape: variable, defined in input
    final_shape: expanded, bounded by other colors or grid edges
  - color: yellow (4)
    behavior: static, does not change
    initial_shape: variable, defined in input
    final_shape: identical to initial shape
  - color: black (0)
    behavior: passive, replaced by azure (8) during expansion
    initial_shape: background and gaps
    final_shape: reduced, only areas not reached by azure expansion

actions:
  - name: flood_fill_expansion
    agent: azure (8)
    target: black (0)
    condition: adjacency
    result: replace '0' with '8'
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8), yellow (4), and black (0) pixels.

2.  **Azure Expansion:** Starting from any azure (8) pixel, iteratively expand the azure color to all adjacent black (0) pixels. Continue this expansion until no more black (0) pixels are adjacent to any azure (8) pixel. This is a "flood fill" operation.

3.  **Yellow Preservation:** The yellow (4) pixels remain unchanged throughout the process. They act as boundaries for the azure expansion.

4. **Black background:** The black (0) pixels are replaced by the expanding azure.

The key improvement is the concept of "iterative expansion" or "flood fill," which accurately captures the transformation's behavior. The yellow object's role as a static boundary is also clarified.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
