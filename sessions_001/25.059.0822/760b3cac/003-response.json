The digits represent different colors. The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8), yellow (4), and white(0). The transformation appears to modify the position and potentially the quantity of azure (8) colored pixels, while keeping the yellow (4) pixels and white (0) unchanged. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The change to the azure pixels seems to be that some single vertical stacks are made horizontal along the top of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If the length does not take up the entirity of the first row, the next vertical stack will be added to the first row starting from the opposite end of the output grid.\n4.  **Preserve:** Copy the yellow (4) pixels and white (0) pixels from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their original positions.\n5. **Remainder:** If any of the original height remains, render the remaining stacks in their original postion.\n\n"
