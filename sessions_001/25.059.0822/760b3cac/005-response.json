            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution on the training set and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the concept of moving vertical stacks of azure pixels to a horizontal line at the top. This approach worked for the first example but failed on others, revealing some critical flaws in the original assumptions. The primary issues seem to be:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Stack Handling**: The initial code assumes *all* azure pixels are part of vertical stacks and need to be moved. It doesn't consider cases where azure pixels might exist independently or as single pixels. The current implementation of `get_vertical_stacks` has a bug. If there's a stack of height 1 it isn't added to the result.\n2.  **Ovewriting Pixels and Simple Copy:** The provided code overwrites other pixels, which is not correct. Yellow and potentially other colored pixels in the path of the \"moved\" azure are lost. We need to preserve and reposition. Also, in some cases, we can simply copy parts of the input to the output, but in others, a transformation is needed.\n3.  **Directionality:** The code moves all detected stacks to the top and adds the azure pixels from left to right and then if necessary, from right to left. It's possible there is not horizontal room for all the azure pixels at the top.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution**\n\n1.  **Refine Stack Detection:** Correct the `get_vertical_stacks` function and augment it with a similar function to find all the azure pixels (not necessarily in a vertical stack)\n2.  **Preserve Non-Azure Pixels:** Modify the transformation logic to ensure that non-azure pixels (yellow, white, etc.) are preserved in their original positions when possible. If there's a location conflict, prefer to keep existing.\n3.  **Adaptive Placement:** Instead of strictly moving stacks to the top, consider a more adaptive placement strategy for the azure pixels. Consider placement that minimizes changes.\n4. **Output Dimensions:** All outputs have the same dimensions as the input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example-by-Example)**\n\nTo get accurate metrics, I'll use a slightly modified version of the provided `get_vertical_stacks` along with a function to find all azure pixels, and compare the input and output grids.\n\n```python\nimport numpy
