    pixels = np.argwhere(grid == color)

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which it handled correctly. However, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in the logic. The initial program assumed that *all* pixels within the bounding box of the azure region should be turned azure. The additional examples show that this is incorrect. The yellow pixels should *always* be preserved, even within the azure bounding box. The program needs to modify the existing azure areas, not create new ones.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
1.  Preserve all instances of the color yellow.
2.  Locate regions of the color azure.
3.  If a region of azure is found, determine the bounding box.
4.  Instead of turning all of the cells to the color azure, we will iterate
    through all of the cells inside the bounding box and:
    - do nothing if the cell is the color yellow.
    - change the color of the cell to azure if it is not yellow.

**Gather Metrics and Results:**

Here's an analysis of each example:

*   **Example 1:** (Correct)
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with a single azure pixel and a yellow pixel.
    *   Output: The azure pixel expands to fill a 2x2 bounding box, but the yellow pixel is preserved.
    *   Code Result: Correct.

*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect)
    *   Input: 5x5 grid with scattered azure and yellow pixels.
    *   Output: Only the initial azure bounding box is filled. Yellow pixels are preserved.  There are separate regions of azure.
    *   Code Result: Incorrect. The code fills the entire bounding box of *all* azure pixels, encompassing areas that should remain unchanged. It essentially connects all azure regions.

*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)
    *    Input: 7x7 with separate groups of color azure.
    *    Output: Each separate azure group becomes a filled bounding box.
    *    Code Result: Incorrect. The entire bounding box is filled as a single azure area.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: yellow_pixels
    properties:
      color: yellow
      behavior: preserved in original positions
      count: variable across examples
  - object: azure_regions
    properties:
      color: azure
      behavior: form filled rectangular regions defined by their bounding box
      count: variable, can be one or more disconnected regions
  - action: fill_bounding_box
    description: |
      The bounding box of *each* contiguous azure region is determined.
      Pixels within this bounding box are changed to azure, *unless* they are yellow.
      Yellow pixels are always preserved.
    constraints:
      - only applies to azure regions
      - preserves yellow pixels
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preservation:** Identify all yellow pixels. These pixels will remain unchanged in the output grid.

2.  **Azure Region Identification:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure pixels. A contiguous region is defined as a group of azure pixels that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right - not diagonal).

3. **Bounding Box Filling**: For *each* identified azure region:
   - Determine the bounding box of that region. The bounding box is the smallest rectangle that encompasses all pixels in the region.
   - Iterate over every cell within that bounding box, changing the color to azure if it is not yellow.

4.  **Output:** The final output grid consists of the preserved yellow pixels and the filled azure bounding boxes, with any other pixels unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
