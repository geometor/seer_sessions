            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code focused on identifying and replicating an \"L\" shape formed by azure pixels. It also correctly identified and handled the preservation of yellow pixels. The strategy was partially successful, working for the first example, but it needs adjustments based on other examples. The main areas needing refinement are:\n\n1.  **Shape Detection:** The code assumes a specific \"L\" shape (3 pixels). We need a more flexible approach to detect connected azure pixels.\n2.  **Expansion Logic:** Expanding the \"L\" shape to its left and right might not be consistent across all scenarios.\n3. **Completeness:** The code doesn't correctly implement a transformation when the azure is *not* an \"L\" shape, which we see in the other training examples.\n\nThe updated strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Improved Shape Detection:** Use a more general method to identify connected azure pixels, regardless of their specific arrangement.\n2.  **Contextual Expansion:** Instead of simply expanding to the left and right, determine the bounding box of the azure region and fill it completely.\n3.  **Yellow Pixel Handling:** Verify yellow color is handled consistently.\n\n**Example and Result Metrics**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the results obtained:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with an \"L\" shaped azure (3 pixels) and a yellow pixel.\n    *   Expected Output: Expanded azure region.\n    *   Actual Output: Correctly expanded azure region.\n    *   Result: **Success**\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 with a single azure, and yellow pixel.\n    *   Expected Output: 3x3 with single azure filled in to 3x1.\n    *   Actual Output: 3x3 with single azure and no expansion.\n    *   Result: **Failure**\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 with two horizontal azure, and yellow pixel.\n    *   Expected Output: 5x5, azure expanded\n    *   Actual Output: 5x5, no expansion.\n    *   Result: **Failure**\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: \"Yellow pixels are preserved in their original positions.\"\n    type: \"preservation\"\n    color: \"yellow\"\n    value: 4\n  - description: \"Azure pixels form a connected region.\"\n    type: \"region\"\n    color: \"azure\"\n    value: 8\n  - description: \"The bounding box of the azure region becomes filled.\"\n    type: \"transformation\"\n    action: \"fill_bounding_box\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Preserve Yellow:** Identify all yellow pixels (value 4) in the input grid and maintain their positions and color in the output grid.\n2.  **Identify Azure Region:** Find all azure pixels (value 8) in the input grid. Determine the bounding box that encompasses all connected azure pixels. This is the smallest rectangle that contains all azure pixels. \"Connected\" means adjacent horizontally or vertically.\n3. **Fill:** Change all pixels within the bounding box to azure color, including the original azure pixels. If there are no azure pixels, there are no changes.\n\n"
