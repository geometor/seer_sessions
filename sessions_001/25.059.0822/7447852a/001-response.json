The red pixels form a diagonal checkerboard-like pattern. The input grids are all 3 rows tall, and the width increases.\n*   **Output Grids:** The output grids maintain the same dimensions as the input grids. They introduce yellow (4) pixels. The yellow pixels appear to \"fill in\" the white spaces between the red diagonals, but only in specific locations. Specifically, they appear to replace the white pixels that are horizontally adjacent to a red one in the original input *after* the first sequence of red pixels in each row.\n* **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a conditional replacement of white pixels with yellow pixels based on their proximity to red pixels. It is crucial to note that there is a directional component: the yellow fills appear from left to right, stopping to be filled when there is another red cell.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
