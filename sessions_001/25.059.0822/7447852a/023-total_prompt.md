Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Diagonally Adjacent Red Pairs:** Scan the input grid to find all pairs of red (2) pixels that are diagonally adjacent.
2.  **Locate Shared White Pixels:** For each diagonally adjacent red pair, check for white (0) pixels that occupy the other two corners of the 2x2 square formed (or implied) by the red pair.
3.  **Conditional Fill:** If and *only if* there are exactly two shared white pixels: change those white pixels to yellow (4).
4. **Ignore Other Cases**: If a pair of diagonally adjacent red pixels does not have two shared white corners, they are ignored.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
