Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to all examples. The core idea of identifying red pixels and conditionally changing subsequent red pixels to yellow, then propagating the yellow color down, has merit. However, the conditions for changing red to yellow and the propagation logic need adjustments. The last example shows the code doesn't handle cases where a row of solid red should be untouched.

The main issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Yellow Placement:** The condition `all_white and next_red_index != -1` is too simplistic. It only checks for white pixels between two red pixels in the same row. It doesn't consider cases where there might be other colors, or where a series of red pixels should remain unchanged.
2.  **Overly Aggressive Yellow Propagation**: Yellow is unconditionally propagated downwards. This will likely lead to incorrect coloring.
3. **All red row untouched:** The last example is a row of all red. The current rule makes no changes to that row, which is correct, but this should be explicitly stated in the rule.

The strategy to resolve these errors is:

1.  **Refine Yellow Placement Condition:** Analyze the spacing and color of pixels *between* red pixels. Look for a pattern in *all* examples where the change from red to yellow occurs.
2.  **Restrict Yellow Propagation:** Yellow should propagate down only as needed in relation to red.
3.  **Explicitly handle red rows** State that if a row is solid red, do nothing.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To understand the patterns, let's use code execution to get detailed information about the examples, focusing on the red pixels and their relationship to the yellow pixels in the output.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_examples(examples):
    analysis = []
    for i, example in enumerate(examples):
        input_grid = example["input"]
        output_grid = example["output"]

        red_pixels_input = np.where(input_grid == 2)
        red_pixels_input = list(zip(red_pixels_input[0], red_pixels_input[1]))
        
        yellow_pixels_output = np.where(output_grid == 4)
        yellow_pixels_output = list(zip(yellow_pixels_output[0], yellow_pixels_output[1]))
        
        red_pixels_by_row_input = {}
        for r, c in red_pixels_input:
            if r not in red_pixels_by_row_input:
                red_pixels_by_row_input[r] = []
            red_pixels_by_row_input[r].append(c)
        
        #sort by columns
        for row in red_pixels_by_row_input:
            red_pixels_by_row_input[row].sort()

        analysis.append({
            "example_index": i,
            "input_grid_shape": input_grid.shape,
            "output_grid_shape": output_grid.shape,

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: red_pixel
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      location: (row, column)
    actions:
      - change_color:
          to: yellow (4)
          condition: "If a red pixel is not the first in its row and is preceded by a red pixel in its row, and there are only white pixels between them, the second red pixel becomes yellow"
      - no_change:
          condition: "If a row contains only red pixels and white pixels, no changes happen."
  - object: yellow_pixel
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      location: (row, column)
    actions:
      - propagate_down:
          condition: "A yellow pixel propagates its color downwards to the cell directly below it in the same column, if the cell exists"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Group by Row:** Group the red pixels by their row index. Sort the red pixels within each row by column.
3. **Conditional Color Change (Red to Yellow):**
   - Skip rows that have only red and white pixels.
   - For all other rows, iterate through the red pixels in each row:
      - If a red pixel is *not* the *first* occurring red pixel in the row and all pixels between the prior red pixel and this one are white, change the value of this (the second) red pixel to yellow (4).
4. **Vertical Yellow Propagation:** Iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell is yellow (4), change the cell directly below it (if it exists) to yellow (4) as well.
5. If a row contains only red pixels and white pixels, no change is made.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
