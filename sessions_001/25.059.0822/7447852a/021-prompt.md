Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Pairs:** Scan the input grid to identify all pairs of red (2) pixels that are diagonally adjacent.

2.  **Locate Shared Whites:** For each diagonally adjacent red pair, locate the white (0) pixels. Only consider the case with *two* white pixels.

3. **Fill Yellow:** If a pair of red pixels are at opposite corners of a 2x2 square, examine the two shared "corner" pixels:
    *   If both corner pixels are white (0), change them to yellow (4).
    * note that diagonally adjacent 2's that do not form an opposite corner of
      a 2x2 square are ignored

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
