Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify White and Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels that are white (value 0) and red (value 2).
2.  **Horizontal Scan:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
3.  **Horizontal Betweenness:** If a white pixel is found, check if it has a red pixel immediately to its left AND a red pixel immediately to its right. If so, change the white pixel to yellow (value 4).
4.  **Vertical Scan:** Iterate through each column of the grid.
5.  **Vertical Betweenness:** If a white pixel is found, check if it has a red pixel immediately above it AND a red pixel immediately below it. If so, change the white pixel to yellow (value 4).
6.  **Ignore Other Cases:** Do not consider diagonal relationships or change any colors from red to any other color, given these conditions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
