Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2).
2.  **Horizontal Scan:** For each row, iterate through the pixels from left to right.
3.  **Conditional Color Change:**
    *   If a white pixel (0) is encountered and is horizontally between two red pixels, change its color to yellow.
    *   If a red pixel is encountered and if is horizontally between white and yellow or yellow and white, change its color to yellow.
4. **Vertical Scan** For each column, iterate through the pixels from top to bottom.
5. **Conditional Color Change:**
        *    If a white pixel is encountered and is vertically between two red pixels change its color to yellow.
        *    If a red pixel is encountered and if is vertically between white and yellow or yellow and white, change its color to yellow.
6. The locations of the yellow pixels in relation to the red suggests the transformation rule may be related to identifying the white pixels surrounded on two sides by the red pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code performs a horizontal and vertical scan, changing white pixels to yellow if they are between two red pixels, and changing red pixels to yellow, if they are between a white and yellow pixel. This works for the first example, but it needs adjustments to handle other cases. Specifically, it seems the code should focus on the conditions that describe an object "between" two other objects. The code also incorrectly modifies red to yellow in some conditions.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Careful Re-examination of Examples:** We need to meticulously examine all input/output pairs, paying close attention to *all* color changes, not just the introduction of yellow.
2.  **Focus on "Betweenness":** The core concept seems to be about a pixel being "between" others. We should define this "betweenness" more rigorously, also considering diagonals.
3.  **Prioritize Horizontal and Vertical:** Because "between" could occur horizontally, vertically, or diagonally and because the prompt asks for two passes, focus on the required horizontal and vertical passes.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll likely need to adjust the natural language program and the code multiple times, testing after each adjustment.

**Metrics and Observations (using manual inspection and reasoning, supplementing with potential `code_execution` where necessary):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with white background, two red pixels horizontally separated by a white pixel.
    *   Output: The white pixel between the red ones turns yellow. The current code correctly handles this.
    *   *Observation:* Horizontal "betweenness" works as initially coded.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid with white background, two red pixels vertically separated by a white pixel.
    *   Output: The white pixel between the red ones turns yellow. The current code correctly handles this.
    *   *Observation:* Vertical "betweenness" works as initially coded.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid. Two red pixels are separated horizontally, two red pixels are separated diagonally.
    *   Output: White turns yellow only between the horizontal red pixels.
    *    *Observation:* Vertical between is implemented and functions properly, Diagonal "betweeness" is not considered in the transformation.

* **Example 4**
    * Input: 11x11 grid. Red pixels are arranged horizontally, vertically and diagonally.
    * Output: Only horizontal and vertical between matter.
    * *Observation:* Confirms horizontal and vertical between, diagonal is irrelevant.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, red, yellow]
      position: [row, column]
    relations:
      between_horizontal:
        subject: white_pixel
        condition: "surrounded by red pixels on the left and right"
        action: "change color to yellow"
      between_vertical:
        subject: white_pixel
        condition: "surrounded by red pixels above and below"
        action: "change color to yellow"
      between_irrelevant:
        subject: "pixels adjacent diagonally"
        action: "no change to color"
      red_to_yellow_irrelevant:
         subject: "red pixel between white and yellow"
         action: "no change to color"
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify White and Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels that are white (value 0) and red (value 2).
2.  **Horizontal Scan:** Iterate through each row of the grid.
3.  **Horizontal Betweenness:** If a white pixel is found, check if it has a red pixel immediately to its left AND a red pixel immediately to its right. If so, change the white pixel to yellow (value 4).
4.  **Vertical Scan:** Iterate through each column of the grid.
5.  **Vertical Betweenness:** If a white pixel is found, check if it has a red pixel immediately above it AND a red pixel immediately below it. If so, change the white pixel to yellow (value 4).
6.  **Ignore Other Cases:** Do not consider diagonal relationships or change any colors from red to any other color, given these conditions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
