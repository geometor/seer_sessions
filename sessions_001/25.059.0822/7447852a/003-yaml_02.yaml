    actions:

        trigger: "Presence of red sequence"
        target: "Adjacent white pixels"
        result: "White pixels become yellow"
        direction: "Initially assumed to be only to the right, horizontally."
    outcome: "Correct"

    actions:

        target: Adjacent white pixels.
        result: White becomes yellow.
        direction: Now includes above, expanding beyond the initial horizontal assumption.
    outcome: "Partially Correct - fills vertically (above) when it should not."
