Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were on the right track, focusing on the interaction between red (2) and white (0) pixels. However, the code only considers horizontal adjacency and filling to the *right* of red sequences. The additional training examples likely reveal scenarios with different spatial relationships or filling directions that need to be incorporated. The core strategy will be to:

1.  **Carefully examine the incorrect outputs:** Identify precisely *where* and *why* the output differs from the expected output. This involves pixel-by-pixel comparison.
2.  **Categorize the errors:** Are the errors due to missing fills, incorrect fills, or a fundamentally different transformation rule?
3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Adjust the description to account for the observed discrepancies. The refined program should generalize across *all* training examples.
4.  **Consider other spatial relationships:** The errors might indicate we need to consider vertical or diagonal adjacency.

**Example and Result Metrics (using code_execution where necessary)**
I need more info to properly gather metrics. I cannot execute code without access to a system, and cannot compare results without knowing the actual results.

**Assumptions:**
- output_grid_0 is the result of `transform(input_grid_0)` applied to the first example pair
- output_grid_1 is the result of `transform(input_grid_1)` applied to the second example pair
- output_grid_2 is the result of `transform(input_grid_2)` applied to the third example pair

Here is the hypothetical information - I need to see the real data.

**Example 0:**

*   **Input:** (Provided in the task description)
*   **Expected Output:** (Provided in the task description)
*   **Actual Output:** (From running `transform(input_grid_0)`) - *Assume this matches the Expected Output*
*   **Discrepancy:** None (assuming initial success)

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** (Provided in the task description)
*   **Expected Output:** (Provided in the task description)
*   **Actual Output:** (From running `transform(input_grid_1)`)
*   **Discrepancy:** Let us imagine the actual output is *almost* correct, but it fills some white pixels with yellow *above* the red, not just to the right. This suggests a vertical component is missing.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** (Provided in the task description)
*   **Expected Output:** (Provided in the task description)
*   **Actual Output:** (From running `transform(input_grid_2)`)
*  **Discrepancy:** Imagine there are NO yellow cells in the output.

    outcome: "Incorrect - no fill."
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

Based on the *hypothetical* discrepancies, here's a revised natural language program. This is a guess and must be re-evaluated after seeing the data:

1.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
2.  Identify contiguous sequences of red (2) pixels.
3.  For each red sequence, examine the *adjacent* white (0) pixels. Adjacency includes *horizontal, vertical*, *and possibly diagonal* neighbors.
4.  Change the color of all adjacent white pixels to yellow.
5. Stop when a non-white pixel is encountered.

**Important Considerations and Next Steps**
The revised natural program contains assumptions that should be re-evaluated.
We need to execute the program on all examples and update the discrepancies and outcomes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
