The locations of the yellow pixels in relation to the red suggests the transformation rule may be related to identifying the white pixels surrounded on two sides by the red pixels.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_adjacent(grid, row, col, max_row, max_col):\n     # Get adjacent cells, including diagonals\n    adjacent_cells = []\n\n    for i in range(max(0, row - 1), min(max_row, row + 2)):\n        for j in range(max(0, col - 1), min(max_col, col + 2)):\n            if (i, j) != (row, col):\n                adjacent_cells.append((i, j, grid[i][j]))\n    return adjacent_cells\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Horizontal Scan and Color Change\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if output_grid[i][j] == 0:  # White pixel\n                if j > 0 and j < cols - 1:\n                    if output_grid[i][j-1] == 2 and output_grid[i][j+1] == 2:\n                        output_grid[i][j] = 4\n            if output_grid[i][j] == 2: # red pixel\n                if j > 0 and j < cols -1:\n                    if (output_grid[i][j-1] == 0 and output_grid[i][j+1] == 4) or (output_grid[i][j-1] == 4 and output_grid[i][j+1] == 0):\n                         output_grid[i][j] = 4\n    # Vertical Scan and Color Change\n    for j in range(cols):  # Iterate through columns\n        for i in range(rows):\n            if output_grid[i][j] == 0: #white\n                if i > 0 and i < rows -1:\n                    if output_grid[i-1][j] == 2 and output_grid[i+1][j] == 2:\n                        output_grid[i][j] = 4\n            if output_grid[i][j] == 2: # red\n                if i > 0 and i < rows - 1:\n                     if (output_grid[i-1][j] == 0 and output_grid[i+1][j] == 4) or (output_grid[i-1][j] == 4 and output_grid[i+1][j] == 0):\n                        output_grid[i][j] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
