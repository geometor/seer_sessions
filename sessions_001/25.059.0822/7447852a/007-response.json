The input grid consists of red (2) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid includes yellow (4) pixels in addition to red and white. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x10). The introduction of yellow pixels seems to be related to the arrangement of red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
