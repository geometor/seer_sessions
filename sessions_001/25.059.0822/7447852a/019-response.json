The primary colors involved appear to be red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The transformation seems to involve some interaction between the red and white pixels, potentially resulting in the appearance of yellow pixels. The layout of the red pixels relative to each other seems important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Only consider the case with *two* white pixels.\n\n3. **Fill Yellow:** If a pair of red pixels are at opposite corners of a 2x2 square, examine the two shared \"corner\" pixels:\n    *   If both corner pixels are white (0), change them to yellow (4).\n    * note that diagonally adjacent 2's that do not form an opposite corner of\n      a 2x2 square are ignored\n\nThis program focuses on the spatial relationship between red pixels, highlighting the significance of diagonal adjacency. It is possible there is another condition, and if so, further test examples could expose that to me.\n"
