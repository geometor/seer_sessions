1. Identify Red Pixels: Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid.
2. Check for Vertical Stacking: for each column containing red, sort the red pixels by row.
3. Conditional Replacement:
    a.  If the red pixel is not at the top of the stack, replace it with azure (value 8).
    b.  Otherwise, keep it as red (value 2)
4. Output: Generate the output grid with the replaced pixels, keeping all other non-red pixels unchanged.
