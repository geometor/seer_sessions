**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve a change in color of some of the red pixels, specifically those at the bottom of vertical red lines. It looks like the transformation "fills" color azure (8) starting from the bottom of each "column" or vertical stack of red (2) pixels, up to a specific height, possibly where the consecutive chain of red pixels ends.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - width: 9
      - height: variable (7, 8, or 9)
      - cells: pixels with color values

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
        - white (0)
        - red (2)
        - azure (8)
      - position: (row, column)

  - type: vertical_red_line
    properties:
      - start_row: row index of the top red pixel
      - end_row: row index of the bottom red pixel
      - column: column index
      - length: end_row - start_row + 1

actions:
  - name: change_color
    parameters:
      - object: pixel
      - from_color: red (2)
      - to_color: azure (8)
    conditions:
      - pixel is at the bottom of a vertical_red_line

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and sometimes diagonally.
  - type: vertical_alignment
    description: Red pixels form vertical lines.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Vertical Red Lines:** Find all contiguous vertical sequences of red (2) pixels. A vertical sequence is defined as a set of adjacent red pixels where each pixel is directly above or below another red pixel in the same column.

2.  **Bottom-Up Fill:** For each vertical red line identified, change the color of the bottom red pixel to azure (8).

3. **Propagate Upwards:** Starting with each newly azure pixel that replaced red pixel. If the pixel directly above is the color red, change the color to azure, repeat this step until the pixel above current one is not red.

4. Leave any part of input that is not part of step 3 unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
