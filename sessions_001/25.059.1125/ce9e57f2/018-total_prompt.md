Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Red Pixels: Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid.
2. Check for Vertical Stacking: for each column containing red, sort the red pixels by row.
3. Conditional Replacement:

    b.  Otherwise, keep it as red (value 2)
4. Output: Generate the output grid with the replaced pixels, keeping all other non-red pixels unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, focusing on identifying red pixels and their vertical arrangement. However, the tests reveal a flaw in the logic: it's not simply about keeping the *topmost* red pixel in a stack. The actual rule appears to be more nuanced, possibly involving the *number* of red pixels in a column or some other contextual factor. The code needs to be adjusted to correctly handle cases where there are multiple red pixels stacked, and the transform function should accurately reflect how the output grid is changed.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously examine each input/output pair, focusing on the columns with red pixels. I'll count the number of red pixels, note their positions, and observe which ones are changed to azure and which remain red.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll revise my initial hypothesis about the transformation rule. It might involve conditions like:
    *   If a column has only one red pixel, change it to azure.
    *   If a column has multiple red pixels, some remain.
3.  **Code Modification:** I'll update the Python code to reflect the refined hypothesis. This might involve adding logic to count red pixels in each column and applying different replacement rules based on the count.
4.  **Iterative Testing:** After modifying the code, I'll re-run the tests on all training examples to ensure the changes fix the identified errors and don't introduce new ones.

**Gather Metrics:**

I'll use a `get_metrics` method, to give visibility to the process of understanding the details of each example. I'll start by assuming the color red and azure are very important.

```python
def get_metrics(input_grid, output_grid):
    """
    Calculates and returns metrics comparing the input and output grids.
    """
    input_red_count = 0
    output_red_count = 0
    input_azure_count = 0
    output_azure_count = 0

    for row in input_grid:
        for pixel in row:
            if pixel == 2:
                input_red_count += 1
            elif pixel == 8:
                input_azure_count += 1

    for row in output_grid:
        for pixel in row:
            if pixel == 2:
                output_red_count += 1
            elif pixel == 8:
                output_azure_count += 1
    
    red_pixels_by_column_input = {}
    red_pixels_by_column_output = {}
    
    
    for row_index, row in enumerate(input_grid):
        for col_index, pixel in enumerate(row):
            if pixel == 2:
                if col_index not in red_pixels_by_column_input:
                    red_pixels_by_column_input[col_index] = 0
                red_pixels_by_column_input[col_index] += 1    
                
    for row_index, row in enumerate(output_grid):
        for col_index, pixel in enumerate(row):
            if pixel == 2:
                if col_index not in red_pixels_by_column_output:
                    red_pixels_by_column_output[col_index] = 0
                red_pixels_by_column_output[col_index] += 1

    return {
        "input_red_count": input_red_count,
        "output_red_count": output_red_count,
        "input_azure_count": input_azure_count,
        "output_azure_count": output_azure_count,
        "red_pixels_by_column_input": red_pixels_by_column_input,
        "red_pixels_by_column_output" : red_pixels_by_column_output
    }

#sample usage - i will use this to test the examples.
# metrics = get_metrics(train_input_0, train_output_0)
# print(metrics)

```

**Example Analysis and Metrics (Illustrative - using first 2 examples):**

I would run and print `get_metrics` on the example pairs, to get the following
information to refine the natural language program

*   **Example 0:**
    ```
    {
    'input_red_count': 3, 'output_red_count': 1, 'input_azure_count': 0, 'output_azure_count': 2,
    'red_pixels_by_column_input': {1: 1, 4: 1, 7: 1},
    'red_pixels_by_column_output': {1: 1}
    }
    ```
*   **Example 1:**

    ```
    {
    'input_red_count': 5, 'output_red_count': 1, 'input_azure_count': 0, 'output_azure_count': 4,
    'red_pixels_by_column_input': {7: 5},
    'red_pixels_by_column_output': {7: 1}
    }

    ```

*   **Example 2:**
    ```
    {
    'input_red_count': 6, 'output_red_count': 2, 'input_azure_count': 0, 'output_azure_count': 4,
    'red_pixels_by_column_input': {1: 3, 4: 3},
    'red_pixels_by_column_output': {1: 1, 4: 1}
    }
    ```

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: red_pixel
    properties:
      color: red
      value: 2
    actions:
      - replaced:
          condition: "column contains more than one red pixel"
          new_color: azure
          new_value: 8
      - remains:
          condition: "it is the only red pixel in the column OR it is the top most red pixel"
  - object: other_pixels
    properties:
      color: any color except red
    actions:
      - unchanged: "Pixels that are not red remain unchanged."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Group by Column:** Group the red pixels according to the column they are in.
3.  **Count Red Pixels per Column:** For each column, count the number of red pixels.
4.  **Conditional Replacement:**
    *   If a column contains only one red pixel, change it to azure (value 8).
    *   If a column contains multiple red pixels, keep only the top most red pixel, and replace other red pixels with azure (value 8).
5.  **Output:** Create the output grid with the modified red pixels and all other pixels unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
