facts:
  - observation: |
      Example 0 shows a perfect match with the initial logic. Red pixels
      stacked vertically are correctly transformed to azure, except for
      the top one.
  - observation: |
      Example 1 has a single red pixel, not stacked vertically and
      the output shows it should be azure.
  - observation: |
     Example 2 shows two stacks of red pixels.
     The top pixels in each stack should remain red, the
     bottom pixels should be azure.
  - rule: |
      Red pixels are transformed to azure if there is a red pixel above them.
  - hypothesis: |
      Red pixels are changed to azure if they are at the bottom of a contiguous shape.
      There are vertical shapes.
