Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels with the color red (value 2).
2.  **Conditional Change**: Starting from the bottom row, examine the existing red vertical pattern. If a red pixel is on or below row 5, it will change to azure.
3.  **Transform:** Change the color of the red pixels in rows 5, 6, and 7, to azure (value 8). All other pixels retain their original color.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = output_grid.shape[0]

    # change output pixels 
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if output_grid[r, c] == 2 and r >= 4 :  # Check for red and row number (starting to count at zero)
                output_grid[r, c] = 8

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the need to change red pixels to azure. However, the row condition (`r >= 4`) is too simplistic and doesn't accurately capture the transformation rule as evidenced by the failures in examples 2 and 3. The core issue is that the rule isn't simply about *any* red pixel below a certain row, but about specific configurations of red pixels. Example 2 and 3 reveal a more specific spatial context (vertical positioning)

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Pay close attention to *where* the color changes occur in *all* training examples, not just the first one. Look for consistent spatial relationships, object properties, etc.
2.  **Refine Conditions:** The row-based condition is insufficient. We need to incorporate the column position and, crucially, consider the spatial relationships between the red pixels. It appears there are vertical "lines" or columns of red, and the rule operates on these columns.
3.  **Iterative Improvement**: Test and verify after change.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where helpful):**

I will provide example-specific observations first, then summarize.

    print(f"  Red Pixels: {red_pixels.tolist()}")
    print(f"  Azure Pixels: {azure_pixels.tolist()}")
    if len(red_pixels) > 0:
        min_red_row = np.min(red_pixels[:, 0])
        max_red_row = np.max(red_pixels[:, 0])
        print(f"  Min Red Row: {min_red_row}, Max Red Row: {max_red_row}")
    print(f" shape: {grid.shape}")

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
