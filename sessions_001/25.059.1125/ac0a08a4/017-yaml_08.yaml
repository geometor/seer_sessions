objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels with integer values 0-9
    properties:
      - Each non-zero pixel represents a color.

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 15x15
    elements: pixels with integer values 0-9
    properties:
      - appears to be related to expansion of the input grid

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: >-
      Each pixel in the input_grid is expanded into the output_grid. Non-zero pixels
      in the input grid create a 5x5 block of the same color in the output grid starting from the corresponding
      position multiplied by 5. Zero-pixels may not have a simple spatial expansion; they
      appear to act differently.
