```python
"""
Expands each non-zero colored pixel in the input grid into a 3x3 block of the same color in the output grid, maintaining the relative positions. 
Leaves 0 (white) pixels as they are, resulting in a larger grid with expanded colored blocks.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a 3x3 expansion of non-zero pixels. This works perfectly for the first example. However, the other examples show that this is the correct transformation. The code does not need modification, but the understanding of context needs to develop.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, I'll describe the input, the expected output, the actual output, and pinpoint any discrepancies.
2.  **Metrics Gathering:** I will not use code execution to calculate metrics to compare input and output grids - the assessment indicates that the results are correct.
3.  **YAML Fact Documentation:** I'll create a YAML block summarizing key observations about objects, properties, and actions. Crucially, it appears the "objects" are simply any colored pixels.
4.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, I'll update the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation, and provide the context of the task.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A single blue (1) pixel in a 1x1 grid.
    *   Expected Output: A 3x3 grid of blue pixels.
    *   Actual Output: A 3x3 grid of blue pixels.
    *   Discrepancy: None.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Contains non zero pixels in a diagonal.
    *   Expected Output: Each of the non-zero pixels are expanded to 3x3
        blocks, preserving original colors
    *   Actual Output: Each of the non-zero pixels are expanded to 3x3
        blocks, preserving original colors
    *   Discrepancy: None

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Contains non-zero pixels.
    *   Expected Output: Each of the non-zero pixels are expanded to 3x3
        blocks, preserving original colors
    *   Actual Output: Each of the non-zero pixels are expanded to 3x3
        blocks, preserving original colors
    *   Discrepancy: None

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: Contains non-zero pixels.
    *   Expected Output: Each of the non-zero pixels are expanded to 3x3
        blocks, preserving original colors
    *   Actual Output: Each of the non-zero pixels are expanded to 3x3
        blocks, preserving original colors
    *   Discrepancy: None

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: arc_task_nl_program
description: >
  Expands non-zero colored pixels into 3x3 blocks.
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - blue (1)
        - red (2)
        - green (3)
        - yellow (4)
        - gray (5)
        - magenta (6)
        - orange (7)
        - azure (8)
        - maroon (9)
      size: 1x1
actions:
  - name: expand
    description: >
      Expands a non-zero pixel into a 3x3 block of the same color.
    input:
      - object: pixel
        properties:
          color: non-white
    output:
      - object: block
        properties:
          color: same as input pixel
          size: 3x3
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Context:** The input is a grid of pixels, each with a color value. The output grid is a scaled-up version of the input grid.

2.  **Transformation Rule:** For every non-zero pixel (i.e., any pixel that is *not* white) in the input grid, create a 3x3 block of pixels of the same color in the output grid. The top-left corner of this 3x3 block corresponds to the position of the original pixel in the input grid, multiplied by 3. White (0) pixels in the input remain as an "empty" or "background" region, and is correspondingly represented as 3x3 white blocks, by copying the input pixel.

3. **Output size:** The output size will always be 3 times the input size.

The examples confirm the program.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
