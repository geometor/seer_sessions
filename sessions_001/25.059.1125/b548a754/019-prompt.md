Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Seed Structure:** Find the contiguous vertical structure of non-black pixels starting from the leftmost column (column 0).
2.  **Determine Expansion Parameters:**
    *   `start_row`: The row index of the topmost pixel of the seed structure.
    *   `height`: The number of contiguous non-black pixels in the seed structure.
    *    `expansion_color`: The color of the topmost pixel of the seed structure.
3.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each row from `start_row` to `start_row + height - 1`, fill the row with the `expansion_color` starting from column 0 up to, but not including, the last column.
4. **Remove Isolated Pixels**: Iterate through all pixels. If a pixel has a color other than black (0), check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). If none of the neighbors have the same color, change the pixel's color to black (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
