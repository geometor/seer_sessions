Dominant colors are white (0), red (2), and blue (1). There's a single azure (8) pixel in the input.\n*   **Shapes:** There's a distinct rectangular shape formed by red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the upper portion. The azure pixel is isolated.\n* **Change:** The shape expands downwards.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
