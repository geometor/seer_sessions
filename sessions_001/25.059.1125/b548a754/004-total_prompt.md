Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 11x11 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of colors, represented by digits. Dominant colors are white (0), red (2), and blue (1). There's a single azure (8) pixel in the input.
*   **Shapes:** There's a distinct rectangular shape formed by red (2) and blue (1) pixels in the upper portion. The azure pixel is isolated.
* **Change:** The shape expands downwards.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: shape1
    type: rectangle
    color: mixed (red, blue)
    initial_position: (rows 1-4, columns 1-4)
    initial_dimensions: 4x4
    contains:
        - color: red(2)
        - color: blue(1)
  - id: pixel1
    type: single_pixel
    color: azure(8)
    initial_position: (row 8, column 3)
    final_position: None

actions:
  - type: expansion
    target: shape1
    direction: down
    amount: 4 rows
    fill: extend internal
    
relationships:
  - object: shape1
    related_to: pixel1
    relation: disjoint # they don't overlap

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** a composite shape in the input grid consisting of connected red (2) and blue (1) pixels.
2. **Locate** an azure pixel in the original.
3.  **Expand** the identified shape *downwards* by four rows.
4. **Propagate** the existing pattern within the red/blue shape. The two center columns of the shape are filled by blue and the outer columns are filled by red.
5. **Remove** azure pixel.

In summary, the transformation involves expanding a specific colored shape downwards, while removing an isolated pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
