<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2304x1744 at 0x7F4C231130D0>Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), blue (1), green (3), magenta (6) and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve identifying a shape of a specific color, and potentially expanding or modifying that shape in the output, based on an adjacent rectangle of different color. There's one notable element that seems out of place, a single azure pixel that is present in the inputs but erased or ignored in the output. This azure pixel could be a "marker" or "cursor," but is ultimately removed. It's not relevant to the transformation of the main shapes. The shapes maintain their relative position, but they're extended based on the position and size of an "outer" shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain multiple colored rectangular shapes.
  - observation: |
      One shape is enclosed or surrounded by another shape of a distinct color.
  - observation: |
      An azure (8) pixel is present in the input grids, but absent in the output grids.
  - observation: |
      The inner shape in the output grid always encloses the same area of the enclosed shape in the input grid.
  - observation: |
     The enclosed inner shape expands to the size of the outer shape, maintaining its original relative position
  - premise: |
      The azure pixel might act as a distraction.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "outer" shape:** Find the largest contiguous rectangular block of pixels of a single color, excluding azure (8).
2.  **Identify the "inner" shape:** Within the boundaries of the "outer" shape, locate a smaller, contiguous rectangular block of pixels of a different color.
3. **Ignore the marker**: Disregard any azure pixel.
4.  **Expand the inner shape:** In the output grid, expand the "inner" shape so it extends to match the size of the "outer" rectangle.
5. **Keep Relative Postion:** Maintain the position of the inner rectangle, keeping it the same size, and expanding outward, filling the inner area with color repetitions.
6.  **Clear other pixels:** Set all other pixels in the output grid to white (0).

In essence, the transformation involves identifying an "inner" rectangle and an "outer" rectangle and expanding the inner to the size of the outer one while maintaining position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
