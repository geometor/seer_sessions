"""
1.  Identify the Outermost Green Object: Find the green object that encloses other objects, if any. If multiple green objects exist, and none fully enclose the others, this rule may not apply, but based on these examples, we assume there's a single "outer" green object.
2.  Identify the Contained Red Object:  Find the red object fully contained within the outermost green object.
3.  Determine the Rightmost Edge: Find the rightmost column index containing *any* non-white (non-zero) pixel in the input grid.
4.  Extend Green: Extend the outermost green object horizontally to the right, filling all cells up to and including the rightmost edge.
5.  Extend Red: Extend the red object horizontally to the right, within the bounds of the extended green object, up to and including the rightmost edge.
6.  Preserve other colored pixels: Ensure that pixels that are not part of the green or red objects are also copied to the output unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
