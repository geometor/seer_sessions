            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this ARC-AGI task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), blue (1), green (3), magenta (6) and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve identifying a shape of a specific color, and potentially expanding or modifying that shape in the output, based on an adjacent rectangle of different color. There's one notable element that seems out of place, a single azure pixel that is present in the inputs but erased or ignored in the output. This azure pixel could be a \"marker\" or \"cursor,\" but is ultimately removed. It's not relevant to the transformation of the main shapes. The shapes maintain their relative position, but they're extended based on the position and size of an \"outer\" shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
