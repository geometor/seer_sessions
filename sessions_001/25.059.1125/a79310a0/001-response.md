Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The core transformation seems to involve a color change and a positional shift. Specifically, azure (8) regions in the input are replaced with red (2) regions in the output. The position of red object in output relates to position of the azure object in input. The red object appears to "lag" the azure object.

**Facts (YAML):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain objects of color azure (8) and white (0).
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain objects of color red (2) and white (0).
  - transformation: |
      The azure object in the input is transformed into the red object.
  - transformation: |
     The size and shape of azure object is preserved in transformation to
     red object.
  - position: |
     The row index of red colored object in the output grid seems to be related to the
     row index of the azure object + 1.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Shape and size:** For each azure object found, copy it's shape and size
    to output.
3.  **Translate Downward:** Shift red object by adding 1 to the y-coordinate (row
    index) of each pixel.
4.  **Recolor:** Change the color of copied object to red (2).
5. **Leave other pixels white.**
