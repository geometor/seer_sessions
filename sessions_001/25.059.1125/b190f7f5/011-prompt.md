Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Grid Expansion:** Start with a 9x9 output grid filled with white (0) pixels.
2. **Azure Removal:** The azure (8) pixels from the input are ignored and aren't included in the output.
3. **Colored Pixel Replication:** For each yellow (4), blue (1), and red (2) pixel in the input grid:
    -   Triplicate its row index and column index to determine the top-left corner of a 3x3 block in the output grid.
    -   Fill a 3x3 block in the output grid, starting at the calculated top-left corner, with the color of the current pixel. However, when placed in the output, extend a single pixel horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, creating a plus sign if the expanded pixel is not obstructed by another color.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
