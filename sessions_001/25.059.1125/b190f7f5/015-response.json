The input grid contains a pattern of colored pixels (red, yellow, and azure), while the output grid expands this pattern in a specific way, maintaining the relative positions of the colors but altering their shapes and introducing large areas of white (0) pixels. The non-zero pixels in the input appear to be \"inflated\" or \"mirrored\" diagonally to form a symmetrical cross-like pattern in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
