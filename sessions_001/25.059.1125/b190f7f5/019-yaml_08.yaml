facts:
  - observation: |
      Each input grid is transformed into an output grid with dimensions that are four times larger in both height and width.
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: |
         All colors in input are replicated in output
      - size: single cell
    transformation:
      - description: |
          Each pixel, regardless of its color, is expanded into a 4x4 block of the same color in the output grid.
      - type: expansion
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: |
          Output grid dimensions are always four times the input grid dimensions (height and width).
    transformation:
      - type: scaling
        factor: 4
