Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid contains a pattern of colored pixels (red, yellow, and azure), while the output grid expands this pattern in a specific way, maintaining the relative positions of the colors but altering their shapes and introducing large areas of white (0) pixels. The non-zero pixels in the input appear to be "inflated" or "mirrored" diagonally to form a symmetrical cross-like pattern in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x8
      - colors: [red, yellow, azure, white]
    observations:
      - Non-white pixels form a diagonal cross structure (from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom left).
      - Colors appear in diagonal lines.

  - type: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 16x16
      - colors: [red, yellow, azure, white]
    observations:
      -  The arrangement of colors creates a mirrored, cross-like shape, emanating from the center
      -  Input non-zero pixels appear expanded and mirrored along both diagonals.
      -  Large areas of white pixels separate colored sections.
      - colors of input grid are preserved in the output grid.
      
  - type: transformation
    properties:
      - relationship: input to output
    observations:
     - Input grid is conceptually centered and expanded in output grid.
     - Each non-zero pixel in the input becomes a 4x4 block of the same color in output, and mirrors it.
     - Output grid size is calculated from input grid size. New width is 2*input.width and new height is 4*input.height, then whichever one is bigger is chosen for width and height of output.
     - Mirror plane follows the diagonals from pixel at output grid coordinates (new_width//2, new_height//2).
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** Calculate the expanded dimensions. The output grid's width is twice the input grid's width, and the output grid's height is four times the input grid's height. Use the max of those two for both width and height of output grid.

2.  **Center and Expand:** Conceptually center the input grid within the larger output grid dimensions.

3.  **Pixel Expansion and Mirroring:** For each non-zero pixel in the input grid:
    *   Create a 2x2 block of the same color in output.
    *   Mirror that 2x2 block, expanding it to a 4x4 block, with mirroring following top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left diagonals.

4. **Fill Remaining Pixels:** Fill all other pixels in the output grid with white (0).

5. **Central Mirroring Planes** The output pixels appear to extend from central mirroring planes that cross at output pixel (new_width//2, new_height//2).
