Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. **Dynamic Output Grid:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by multiplying the input grid's dimensions by 3. Create an output grid filled with white (0) pixels.
2. **Azure Removal:** Ignore azure (8) pixels in the input grid; they don't affect the output.
3. **Colored Pixel Replication:** For each yellow (4), blue (1), and red (2) pixel in the input grid:
    - Calculate the top-left corner coordinates in the output grid by multiplying the input row and column indices by 3.
    - Create a "plus" shape centered at the calculated coordinates with the color of the input pixel. The plus extends one pixel in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) from the center.  The plus is truncated if it would extend beyond the output grid boundaries.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
