Here's my analysis:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The primary element seems to be horizontal lines of a single color (red, represented by '2'). The transformation appears to involve adding layers of other colors (green '3', and blue '1') above and below the initial red line, with white (0) as a background. The sizes of these colored layers seem to depend on the length of initial red lines.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note its row position and length.\n2.  **Create the Green Layer:** Above the red line, create a green (3) layer. The green layers height/number of rows are determined by the number of '3' value, which seems to be +1 of '2' value and it stops if there is not enough space.\n3.  **Create the Blue Layer:** Below the red line, create a blue (1) layer. The number of blue rows equals to the number of consecutive cells having '1', it also increases in accordance with '2', stopping if not enough space in grid.\n4. **Fill remaining**: The remaining part of the grids are filled with '0'.\n\nThe program effectively describes a layered structure built around the initial red line, with the green and blue layers expanding relative to the red line's length.\n"
