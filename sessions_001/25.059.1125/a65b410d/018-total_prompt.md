Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms the input grid by creating green and blue objects relative to a red object.

1. **Identify the Red Object:** Locate the horizontal line of red (2) pixels. Note its length and starting position.
2. **Create the Green Object:** Above the red object, create a green (3) rectangular block.
  - The green block's width is one pixel wider than the red object.
  - The green block's height is two rows.
  - The green block's left edge aligns with red objects left edge.
3. **Create the Blue Object:** Below the red object, create a blue (1) L-shaped block.
 - The top of the L aligns with the bottom of the red object.
 - It consists of three stacked blue pixels.
4. **Retain Unchanged Pixels**: All white pixels (0) that are not part of the generated objects remain as 0.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. While it performed correctly on that example, it failed on others. The primary issue is that the initial program was too specific, assuming fixed positions and shapes relative to the red object. The subsequent examples reveal variations in the blue object's shape and the potential absence of the red object.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Analyze Failures:** Carefully examine the failed examples to identify the incorrect assumptions in the initial program.
2.  **Refine Object Definitions:** Develop more robust definitions for the green and blue objects, accommodating variations in shape and position. The blue object is not always "L" shaped.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The natural language program needs to incorporate conditional logic (if-then statements) to handle cases where the red object is missing or where object placement needs to be adjusted based on grid boundaries.
4.  **Update Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to incorporate the new understanding.
5. **Update Code**: Regenerate the python code to reflect the new program.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To accurately assess the examples, I need to perform calculations. I will use a combination of direct observation and, where necessary, code snippets to gather metrics, and the result of running the transform against all the inputs.

Here's a breakdown of each example, including the results of running the provided `transform` function:

*   **Example 1:** Input and Output grids are 6x11. The transform was **successful**.
    *   Red object: horizontal line of length 3 at row 3, starting at column 4.
    *   Green object: rectangle of width 4 and height 2 above the red object.
    *   Blue object: L-shape of height 3 below the red object, one unit to the right.
*   **Example 2:** Input and Output grids are 10x10. The transform was **unsuccessful**.
    *   Expected Output: There's a green rectangle of height 2 and width 6, and a blue vertical line of length 3. There is no red object.
    *   Actual Output: There is no red object so the tranform does nothing - result is the same as input
    *   *Observation: The initial program failed because it depends on finding the red object which does not exist.*
*   **Example 3:** Input and Output grids are 9x9. The transform was **unsuccessful**.
    *   Expected output: There is a single horizontal red line of length 2. Above it a green rectangle with length 3 and height 2. Below it, three blue pixels aligned to the left of the red pixels.
    *   Actual output: same result as expected.
    *   *Observation: success!*
*   **Example 4:** Input and Output grids are 12x15. The transform was **unsuccessful**.
    *   Expected output: There is a single horizontal red line of length 5. Above it a green rectangle with length 6 and height 2. Below it, three blue pixels aligned to the left of the red pixels.
    *   Actual output: same result as expected.
    *   *Observation: success!*

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Check for Red Object:** First, examine the input grid to determine if a horizontal red (2) line exists.

2.  **Conditional Actions:**
    *   **If a red object is present:**
        *   Create a green (3) rectangle above the red object. The green rectangle's width is one greater than the red object's length. The green rectangle's height is 2. The left edge of the green rectangle aligns with the left edge of the red object.
        *   Create a blue (1) vertical line of length 3 below the red object. The top of the blue line aligns with the bottom of the red object, and its left edge also aligns with the left edge of the red object.
    *   **If a red object is NOT present:**
        *   Create a green (3) rectangle at the top of the grid (row 0). The width and height should be determined based on input.
        *   Create a blue (1) object, which is a vertical line with a height of 3, in the bottom-left corner of the grid, starting from the bottom row.

3. **Retain Unchanged Pixels**: All white (0) pixels not part of created objects should remain white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
