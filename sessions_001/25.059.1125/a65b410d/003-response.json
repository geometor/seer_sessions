The input grid seems to be mostly empty (filled with 0s, or white), with a small object of color 2 (red) present. The output grid introduces new colors (3/green, and 1/blue) and expands upwards from existing colors in some manner. There appears to be a relationship, in that the colored pixels in the output appear near or around colors in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
