Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of numerical values, representing colors. The input grid seems to be mostly empty (filled with 0s, or white), with a small object of color 2 (red) present. The output grid introduces new colors (3/green, and 1/blue) and expands upwards from existing colors in some manner. There appears to be a relationship, in that the colored pixels in the output appear near or around colors in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - color_values: [0, 2]

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colors.
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - color_values: [0, 1, 2, 3]

  - object: red_object
    type: shape
    description: a solid shape
    properties:
      color: 2
      input_location: (3,0), (3,1)

  - object: green_object
    type: shape
    description: a solid shape of the same color
    properties:
      color: 3
      output_location: (0,0) to (2,4)

  - object: blue_object
    type: shape
    description: small, isolated cell
    properties:
      color: 1
      output_location: (4,0)

  - action: growth
    description: New color blocks (green and blue) are appearing based on location of red.
    details: 
     - Green appears above and adjacent to any red pixels.
     - Blue apperas below the left-most red pixel.

  - relationship: spatial_adjacency
    description: The location of the red object in the input seems to determine the creation of new colors around it.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels with the value '2' (red) in the input grid.
2.  **For each** red pixel:
    *   Create a green '3' pixel directly above, as long as it exists within the output grid. Continue expanding upwards adding green '3' until reaching the grid boundary, forming a contiguous green object expanding diagonally to the upper left and upper right.
    *   Create a blue '1' pixel directly below the left-most '2' if it exists.
3.  **Retain** all original '2' pixels in their original position.
4.  All other pixels that were '0' (white) in the input grid remain '0' (white).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
