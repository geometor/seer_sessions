The input grid primarily contains white (0) and red (2) pixels, while the output grid introduces green (3) and blue (1) pixels in addition to the original red and white.  There's a clear spatial relationship between the input and output. The red object in the input seems to define a region that influences the placement of green and blue in the output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
