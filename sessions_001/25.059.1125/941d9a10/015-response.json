The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x10). There are changes in some specific cell values, while many remain the same. The most prominent changes seem to involve the introduction of the numbers 1, 2, and 3, replacing 0 in strategic locations.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There is a '5' just above and below each '0'.\n    * change the right most '0' to '2'.\n\n4.  **Bottom Modification:**\n * in the bottom section of the grid, identify sections where the input grid is all 0, and there is a `5` column going up from the bottom, but that don't reach the center horizontal line.\n    * change the lowest '0' in the selected column to '3'.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies columns of 5s. For 5's columns that extend from top section down to the center horizontal row, a '1' is placed at the top adjacent 0. For '5's that appear on the center horizontal, the adjacent '0' to the right is changed to a `2`. For 5 columns in the bottom section that don't connect to the center row, place a '3' at the bottom-most, adjacent '0'. Other cells appear to retain their original values.\n"
