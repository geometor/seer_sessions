objects:
  - name: vertical_5_column
    description: A contiguous vertical sequence of '5's.
    properties:
      - extends_to_center: True if the column reaches the row immediately above the center row.
      - extends_to_bottom: True if the bottom of the column reaches the last row
      - adjacent_zeros: A list of (row, col) tuples representing '0's adjacent to the column.

  - name: center_row
    description: horizontal line dividing the input - for grids of odd numbered rows, this will be the row immediately above the center
    properties:
      - has_5: True if the center row contains a '5'.

actions:
  - name: change_adjacent_zeros_to_1
    object: vertical_5_column
    condition: extends_to_center is True
    action: Change all adjacent '0's above the column to '1'.

  - name: change_adjacent_zeros_to_2
    object: center_row
    condition: has_5 is True
    action: Change all adjacent '0' pixels to '2'.

  - name: change_adjacent_zeros_to_3
    object: vertical_5_column
    condition: extends_to_bottom and not extends_to_center
    action: Change the bottom-most adjacent '0' below the column to '3'
