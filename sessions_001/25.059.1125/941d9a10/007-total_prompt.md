Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify and Preserve Static Elements:** The gray (5) pixels, forming two horizontal lines (rows 3 and 4) and two vertical lines (columns 3 and 7), remain unchanged throughout the transformation.

2.  **Top-Left Region Transformation:** The white (0) pixels within the top-left 3x3 subgrid (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) are changed to blue (1).

3.  **Middle Region Transformation:** The white (0) pixels within the 3x3 subgrid defined by rows 5-6 and columns 4-6 are changed to red (2).

4.  **Bottom-Right Region Transformation:** The white (0) pixels within the 3x3 subgrid defined by rows 7-8 and columns 7-8 are changed to green (3).

5. **Preserve other white pixels:** All other white pixels that are not gray and not included in colored regions, remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
