Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to replace a single blue pixel in the input grid with a white pixel,
and then create a diagonal line of blue pixels running from the top-right to the bottom-left corner of the grid,
essentially inverting rows and columns.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by replacing a blue pixel and drawing a diagonal line.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Find the location of the blue pixel (value 1).  Assume there is only one or none.
    blue_pixel_positions = np.where(input_grid == 1)
    if len(blue_pixel_positions[0]) > 0:  # Check if a blue pixel exists
        blue_row, blue_col = blue_pixel_positions[0][0], blue_pixel_positions[1][0]
        output_grid[blue_row, blue_col] = 0  # Replace the blue pixel with white.
    else:  # if no blue pixel found, assume top-right
      blue_row, blue_col = 0, cols-1

    # Create the diagonal of blue pixels
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if r == rows - 1 - c :
              output_grid[r,c] = 1

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
