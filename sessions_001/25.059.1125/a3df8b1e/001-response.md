Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on identifying the core logic and expressing it in a structured way.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary element is a 2D grid of pixels. The dominant color is white (0).  A single blue (1) pixel appears in the bottom row of the input grids. The output grids seem to be a transformation of the input, involving a pattern of alternating white and blue pixels, and the position of the blue pixel appears to shift in a predictable way based on the initial blue pixel location in the input grid. The height of input and output seems to be constant. The output grid width seems to be determined based on input grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    properties:
      - height: Consistent between input and output for each pair.
      - width: Input width varies (2, 3, 4). Output width seems related.
      - colors: Primarily white (0) and blue (1).
  - type: object
    description: A single blue pixel in the input.
    properties:
      - color: Blue (1)
      - position: Located in the bottom row of the input grid.
      - movement: Its position influences the output pattern.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output grid is generated based on the input grid.
    properties:
      - pattern: Alternating blue and white pixels in the output.
      - width_relation: output grid width is equal to the input grid width.
      - height relation: output grid height is equal to the input grid height.
      - blue_pixel_shift:  The blue pixel's initial position dictates the output pattern's starting point.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Initialization:**  Observe the input grid. Note its height and width, and the column index of the single blue (1) pixel in the bottom row.

2. **Output Grid Creation:** Create an output grid with the same height and width as the input grid.

3. **Pattern Generation:** Iterate through each cell of the output grid, row by row, and column by column.

4. **Color Assignment:**
    *   Start filling columns with the blue pixel, shifting its location up by one row in each subsequent column, until it is in the first row, at which point the location resets back to the bottom row and repeats this behaviour.
    * The row that contains the blue pixel shifts by one column to the right from its position in the previous column.

5.  Fill all remaining cell with white pixels.
