Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x3 grid, and the output is a 10x3 grid. The primary colors involved are white (0) and blue (1). The input grid contains a single blue pixel at the bottom left (1, 0, 0). The output grid seems to "oscillate" the blue pixel, creating a repeating pattern. The single blue pixel in the input appears to be replicated and moved in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x3
    elements: pixels
    colors: [white, blue]

  - type: pixel
    color: blue
    input_position: [9, 0] # row, column (0-indexed)

actions:
  - type: replication
    description: The blue pixel is replicated multiple times.
  - type: translation
    description: The replicated pixels are positioned in a specific alternating pattern.

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains a single blue pixel.
  - output_grid: Contains multiple blue pixels derived from the input pixel.
  - pattern:  Blue pixels alternate positions on columns 0 and 1.
  - pattern_repetition: The overall pattern is a repeating sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the single blue pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Replicate** the blue pixel.
3.  **Create a repeating pattern:** Starting on the first row
      * at row 0, place a blue pixel on column 1
      * at row 1, place a blue pixel on column 0
      * at row 2, place a blue pixel on column 1
      * at row 3, place a blue pixel on column 2
4. Repeat 3, until we create the 10 rows.

In essence, the blue pixel is replaced by a vertical pattern that alternates columns every row, creating the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
