Previous Code:

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)

    # Get the input color
    input_color = input_grid[0, 0]
    # Determine the second color (next in sequence)
    second_color = (input_color + 1) % 10

    # change output pixels 
    for c in range(cols):
        for r in range(rows):
            if c % 2 == 0:  # Even column
                output_grid[r, c] = input_color if r % 2 == 0 else second_color
            else:  # Odd column
                output_grid[r, c] = second_color if r % 2 == 0 else input_color

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the checkerboard pattern code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a checkerboard pattern, alternating between the input grid's color and the next color in sequence. While this works for some cases, it doesn't account for variations in the starting position of the checkerboard pattern or different input colors. The primary issue is that the current logic assumes the top-left pixel always starts with the input color. This needs to be more flexible.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the `Train Set Results` to pinpoint where the code's assumptions fail. We'll check where the output matches the expected output and where it deviates.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for consistent patterns in how the checkerboard is applied across different examples. Does the starting color always depend on the top-left pixel's original color, or is there a different rule?
3.  **Refine Description:** Update the natural language program to reflect the observed patterns, making it more general and accurate.

**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis**

I'll use a narrative approach to describe and record the details of the input, output, and expected output.

Here's a breakdown of each example:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** 3x3 grid, all pixels are blue (1).
*   **Expected Output:** Checkerboard pattern of blue (1) and red (2).
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*   **Assessment:** The code works correctly for this case.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 5x5 grid, all pixels are green (3).
*   **Expected Output:** Checkerboard pattern of green (3) and yellow (4).
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*    **Assessment:** The code works correctly for this case.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 6x6 grid, all pixels are yellow (4).
*    **Expected Output:** Checkerboard pattern of yellow (4) and gray (5).
*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
*   **Assessment:** The code works correctly for this case.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input_grid: 3x3, all pixels blue (1)
      output_grid: Checkerboard pattern of blue (1) and red (2)
      code_result: correct
  - example_2:
      input_grid: 5x5, all pixels green (3)
      output_grid: Checkerboard pattern of green (3) and yellow (4)
      code_result: correct
  - example_3:
      input_grid: 6x6, all pixels yellow (4)
      output_grid: Checkerboard pattern of yellow(4) and gray (5).
      code_result: correct
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation creates a checkerboard-like pattern within the grid.
The input grid is filled with a single color.
The output grid uses two colors:
- the color in the original input grid.
- the next color in the sequence (wrapping around from 9 back to 0).
    These two colors alternate in a checkerboard pattern.
    The top-left pixel of the output grid is the same as the input grid.
    Adjacent pixels, either horizontally or vertically, will be different
    colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
