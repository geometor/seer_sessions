Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves checking for the presence of a blue pixel in the input grid. If no blue pixel is found, the output is an all-zero grid. If a blue pixel is present, its column index is incremented by one to determine the column in the output grid that will be entirely filled with blue pixels.
"""

    # Find the coordinates of the blue pixel (value 1).
    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
      for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
        if grid[r][c] == 1:
          return (r,c)
    return None

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions and all zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # find blue, could be none
    blue_pixel = find_blue_pixel(input_grid)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
