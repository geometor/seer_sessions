The input grid is mostly filled with white pixels (0) with a single blue pixel (1) at the bottom-left corner. The output grid has the same dimensions, but the blue pixel has been replaced by white, and a diagonal line of blue pixels extends from the bottom-left to the top-right. The blue pixels seem to be arranged in positions that are symmetric about a diagonal axis.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
