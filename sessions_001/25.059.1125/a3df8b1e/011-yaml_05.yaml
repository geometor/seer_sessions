examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: (0, 1)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue
        pattern: "repeating sequence: col 1, col 0, col 1, col 2"
    transformation: "Output pattern is a fixed sequence, potentially unrelated to the input blue pixel's row, but dependent on its presence."

  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: (2, 0)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: "all rows, column 0"
    transformation: "Output blue pixels are placed in the first column (column index 0)."

  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: (4, 3)
    output_objects:
      - color: blue
        location: "all rows, column 4"
    transformation: "Output blue pixels are placed in a column that's +1 the column index of the blue pixel in input"

  - example_id: 4
    input_objects:
        - color: none
          location: none
    output_objects:
        -color: none
         location: none
    transformation: if no blue pixel, return an all white image
