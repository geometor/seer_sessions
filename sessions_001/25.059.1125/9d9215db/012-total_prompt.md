Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Green Pixel Movement:** For each green pixel (3) in the input, move its y position. if the original y position is less than the center Y, increase the y by one. If the original y position if greater than the center Y, reduce it by one.

2.  **Blue and Yellow Pixel Mirroring:** Identify the central horizontal axis of the grid (y=9). For the blue (1) and yellow(4) pixels , mirror their position across this central axis. The new y-coordinate will be `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`

3. **Blue Pixel Expansion**: For each original and newly mirrored blue pixel, create copies of it by repeating the blue color to the left until the x coordinate 3 and right until the x coordinate 15.

4.  All other cells remain unchanged (value 0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code captured some key aspects of the transformation, particularly the mirroring of blue and yellow pixels and the movement of green pixels. However, the expansion of blue pixels was not entirely accurate, and the handling of overlapping pixels needs to be addressed, since multiple colors might end in a location that had a different value before. The execution results confirm discrepancies, especially in cases involving multiple transformations and edge cases.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, focusing on the differences between the expected output and the actual output of the current code.
2.  **Refine Object Definitions:** Improve the identification and categorization of objects (pixels of specific colors) and their properties (position, movement, expansion).
3.  **Precise Action Descriptions:** Detail the actions (move, mirror, expand) with greater precision, including conditions and constraints.
4.  **Prioritize:** Determine an order of operations of color changes

**Code Execution for Metrics**

I'll use a simple `numpy` comparison to highlight differences between the expected and actual outputs. Since the prompt does not allow the use of tools, there will be no code execution, but a discussion of metrics for the examples.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   The green pixel moves correctly.
    *   The blue pixel mirrors correctly and expands.
    *   The yellow pixel mirrors correctly.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Green pixels move correctly.
    *    Blue and yellow pixels are mirrored correctly
    *   Expansion is not consistent between examples
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Green pixels move correctly
    *   Blue and yellow pixels are mirrored correctly
    *   Expansion is incorrect

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: green
    value: 3
    action: move
    movement_rule: |
      Moves one step closer to the center Y.
      If original y < center y, new_y = old_y + 1
      If original y > center y, new_y = old_y - 1
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    action: mirror_and_expand
    mirror_rule: |
      Mirrored across the horizontal center axis.
      new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y
    expansion_rule: "Expands horizontally from x=3 to x=15, inclusive."
  - color: yellow
    value: 4
    action: mirror
    mirror_rule: |
      Mirrored across the horizontal center axis.
      new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y
  - color: white
    value: 0
    action: no change

grid_properties:
  center_y: "grid_height // 2"
order_of_operations: [move green, mirror yellow, mirror_and_expand blue, "fill rest"]

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Green Pixel Movement:** Every green pixel (value 3) moves one step vertically *towards* the center of the grid.
    *   If a green pixel is above the horizontal center line, it moves one step down.
    *   If a green pixel is below the horizontal center line, it moves one step up.
    * If the green pixel is on the horizontal center line, it remains.

2.  **Yellow Pixel Mirroring:** Every yellow pixel (value 4) is mirrored across the horizontal center line of the grid. The new vertical (y) position is calculated as `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`.

3.  **Blue Pixel Mirroring and Expansion:** Every blue pixel (value 1) is:
    *   First mirrored across the horizontal center line, using the same formula as the yellow pixels: `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`.
    *   Then, the mirrored blue pixel is expanded horizontally, filling all cells from x=3 to x=15 (inclusive) with the blue color.

4. **Order of operations**: The order of changes is important. Green moves. Yellow mirrors. Blue mirrors and expands.

5.  All other pixels remain unchanged. Specifically, white pixels stay white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
