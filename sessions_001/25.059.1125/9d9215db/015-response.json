The non-zero pixels appear to be isolated, single pixels.\n*   **Output:** A 19x19 grid where the original non-zero pixels are maintained, but now have \"stripes\" or \"bands\" of the same color extending horizontally to the left and right, stopping when they encounter an edge of a colored block of 3x3 made from the same color, and these blocks appear centered on the y location of each original pixel, with a separation of one white row.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
