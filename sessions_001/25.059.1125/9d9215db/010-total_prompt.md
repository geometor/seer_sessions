Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (19x19).
*   Most of the grid cells are '0' (white).
*   There are a few non-zero colored pixels in the input: '3' (green), '1' (blue), and '4' (yellow).
*   The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid.
*    The green pixels at the top and the bottom of the input image maintain their x value and are moved one step towards the center,
*   The blue and yellow pixels are mirrored around a central horizontal axis, and additional blue pixels are added in straight horizontal lines.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions (19x19).
  - object: Green pixels (value 3)
    properties:
      - initial_position: [(1, 17), (17,17)]
      - action: Move one step towards the center on the Y axis.
      - final_position: [(1, 1), (17,1)]
  - object: Blue pixels (value 1)
    properties:
      - initial_positions:  [(3, 13), (5, 15)]
      - action: Mirror vertically across the center horizontal line (y=9).
      - action: Replicate and create horizontal line.
      - final_position_sets:
          - [(3,3),(3,5),(3,7),(3,9),(3,11),(3,13),(3,15)]
          - [(15,3),(15,5),(15,7),(15,9),(15,11),(15,13),(15,15)]
  - object: Yellow pixels (value 4)
    properties:
       - initial_position: [(3, 15)]
       - action: Mirror vertically across the center horizontal line (y=9)
       - final_position: [(15,3)]
  - grid_center:
      - center_y: 9
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Green Pixel Movement:** For each green pixel (3) in the input, move its y position. if the original y position is less than the center Y, increase the y by one. If the original y position if greater than the center Y, reduce it by one.

2.  **Blue and Yellow Pixel Mirroring:** Identify the central horizontal axis of the grid (y=9). For the blue (1) and yellow(4) pixels , mirror their position across this central axis. The new y-coordinate will be `new_y = (grid_height - 1) - old_y`

3. **Blue Pixel Expansion**: For each original and newly mirrored blue pixel, create copies of it by repeating the blue color to the left until the x coordinate 3 and right until the x coordinate 15.

4.  All other cells remain unchanged (value 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
