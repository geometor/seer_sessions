facts:
  - observation: "Input grid contains isolated colored pixels (non-zero values)."
  - observation: "Output grid retains original colored pixels."
  - observation: "Colored pixels in the output grid have horizontal bands of the same color extending to the left and right."
  - observation: "Bands stop at the edge of a 3 by 3 block of the same color, centered on the input pixel y."
  - observation: "The original colored pixels, and by extension the stripes, are separated from each other by the 3 by 3 blocks"
  - property: "Input grid size is 19x19."
  - property: "Output grid size is 19x19."
  - colors_present: [1, 3, 4, 8]
  - relationship:"Output colored bands are derived from and connected to input colored pixels"
