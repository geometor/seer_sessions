Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 19x19 grid with a few non-zero pixels (colored pixels) scattered within a field of zero-value pixels (white pixels). The non-zero pixels appear to be isolated, single pixels.
*   **Output:** A 19x19 grid where the original non-zero pixels are maintained, but now have "stripes" or "bands" of the same color extending horizontally to the left and right, stopping when they encounter an edge of a colored block of 3x3 made from the same color, and these blocks appear centered on the y location of each original pixel, with a separation of one white row.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid contains isolated colored pixels (non-zero values)."
  - observation: "Output grid retains original colored pixels."
  - observation: "Colored pixels in the output grid have horizontal bands of the same color extending to the left and right."
  - observation: "Bands stop at the edge of a 3 by 3 block of the same color, centered on the input pixel y."
  - observation: "The original colored pixels, and by extension the stripes, are separated from each other by the 3 by 3 blocks"
  - property: "Input grid size is 19x19."
  - property: "Output grid size is 19x19."
  - colors_present: [1, 3, 4, 8]
  - relationship:"Output colored bands are derived from and connected to input colored pixels"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-zero (colored) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Iterate** through each identified colored pixel.
3.  **Create a 3x3 block** of the same color centered vertically at each original pixel position.
4.  **For each colored pixel**, extend a horizontal line of the same color to the left and right.
5.  **Stop extension** when the line reaches the border of the colored blocks from step 3, or at the edge of the board.
6. Copy all non-zero pixels to the result matrix
