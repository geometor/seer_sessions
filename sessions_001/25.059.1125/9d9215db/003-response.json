Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves a grid of numerical values, each representing a color. The input grid transforms into the output grid, suggesting a rule-based manipulation of the grid elements. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), blue (1), and red (2). The transformation doesn't appear to be a simple global operation (like changing all 1s to 2s) but seems context-dependent, potentially based on the positions and neighbors of the pixels. It also seems like vertical mirroring may be happening, or some operation that mimics this.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
