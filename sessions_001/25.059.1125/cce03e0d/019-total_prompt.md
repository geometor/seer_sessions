Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is replicated once, creating two copies of the original. These copies are then placed adjacent to each other, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally to form a larger grid. The output grid's dimensions are double of input grid for width and height, meaning the output grid always have four instances of original input pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get input grid dimensions
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Calculate output grid dimensions
    output_height = input_height * 2
    output_width = input_width * 2

    # Initialize output_grid with zeros
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Embed the input grid four times to form a 2x2 pattern
    output_grid[0:input_height, 0:input_width] = input_grid
    output_grid[0:input_height, input_width:output_width] = input_grid
    output_grid[input_height:output_height, 0:input_width] = input_grid
    output_grid[input_height:output_height, input_width:output_width] = input_grid
    
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
