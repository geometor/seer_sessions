            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a small 3x3 grid (input) into a larger 9x9 grid (output). The input grids contain single-digit integers (0-2) representing different colors. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid, with a specific pattern of replication and placement of the input grid's elements. The '0' pixels in the input appear to act as a background or filler. The core transformation appears to involve repositioning and potentially replicating the non-zero elements of the input grid within a larger, mostly empty, 9x9 output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It seems the original non-zero pixels are arranged on opposite corners, with 2 repetitions for each 3x3 sub-grid.\n\nIn summary, the transformation replicates the input grid's non-zero elements, placing each original color pixel into the top-left and bottom-right 3x3 quadrants of the larger output grid. The placement in the expanded grid directly related to the original position, maintaining the initial local structure. The zero values seem to serve as a background color.\n"
