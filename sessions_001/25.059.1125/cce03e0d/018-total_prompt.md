Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved embedding the input grid multiple times within a larger 9x9 grid. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this pattern does not hold universally. The output grid size and embedding pattern seem to change based on the input. It appears we need a more adaptive approach that takes into account the dimensions of the input grid to determine the output size and embedding logic.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Input-Output Dimensions:** Determine the relationship between input and output grid dimensions for each example.
2.  **Identify Embedding Pattern:** Look for consistent patterns in how the input is embedded within the output, if any.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Modify the description to reflect a more general rule that adapts to different input sizes and embedding strategies.
4.  **revise code:** Modify code to incorporate this new rule.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To get a clearer picture, let's define a function to report on the examples:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    output_shape = output_grid.shape
    input_pixels = np.count_nonzero(input_grid)
    output_pixels = np.count_nonzero(output_grid)
    print(f"  Input shape: {input_shape}")
    print(f"  Output shape: {output_shape}")
    print(f"  Input non-zero pixels: {input_pixels}")
    print(f"  Output non-zero pixels: {output_pixels}")
    print(f"Output Pixels / Input Pixels:{output_pixels/input_pixels}")

# Dummy data for demonstration - replace with actual data loading
train_examples = [
    (np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]), np.array([[1, 2, 0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 0, 3, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 0, 3, 4]])),  # Example 1 (assuming this was the original)
    (np.array([[5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 1]]), np.array([[5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 1, 8, 9, 1], [5, 6, 7, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 1, 8, 9, 1]])),  # Example 2
    (np.array([[2]]), np.array([[2, 2], [2, 2]])),  # Example 3
]

for i, (input_grid, output_grid) in enumerate(train_examples):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid)

```

**Code Execution Results:**

```text

  Input shape: (2, 2)
  Output shape: (5, 5)

  Input shape: (2, 3)
  Output shape: (4, 6)
  Input non-zero pixels: 6

            shape: [2,2]
            pixels: 4
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is replicated once, creating two copies of the original. These copies are then placed adjacent to each other, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally to form a larger grid. The output grid's dimensions are double of input grid for width and height, meaning the output grid always have four instances of original input pixels.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
