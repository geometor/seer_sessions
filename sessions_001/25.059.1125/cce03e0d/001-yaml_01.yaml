objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-2)
    properties:
      - color_coded: True
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-2)
    properties:
      - color_coded: True
      - mostly_empty: True # Most cells are 0

actions:
  - name: expand
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Transforms the 3x3 input grid into a 9x9 output grid.
  - name: replicate_and_position
    input: non-zero elements of input_grid
    description:  Places the non-zero elements of the input grid into specific locations within the output grid, potentially with replication.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: The output grid is a patterned expansion of the input grid.
  - element_placement: Non-zero elements from the input_grid maintain their values in the output_grid, but their positions change according to a specific rule.
