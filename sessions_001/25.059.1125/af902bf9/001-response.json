The red pixels appear to connect or fill areas defined by the yellow pixels in the output.\n*    **Connectivity:** The placement of red pixels is based on the position and arrangement of yellow pixels in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If the yellow pixels are close (adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally), a single red pixel is placed in the direct center if exist.\n4. If the yellow pixels for a rectangle outline, **fill** the area enclosed by the yellow pixels with red (2) pixels. The outline is formed by yellow pixels at opposing corners, no matter how sparse.\n5. If the yellow pixels do not form an enclose rectangle, find areas between them, and insert a red pixel in the center between them.\n6. **Leave** all other pixels unchanged (background remains white/0).\n\nIn summary the rule is: Locate yellow pixels, and fill red pixels between them, and the shape of the fill is defined by the minimum rectangle that encloses them.\n"
