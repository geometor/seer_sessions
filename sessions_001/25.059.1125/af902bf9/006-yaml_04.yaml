facts:
  - object: yellow_pixels
    color: yellow
    value: 4
    property: shape
    description: |
        Represents pixels of yellow color.
        The shape formed by these pixels varies. It can be disconnected
        pixels, or connected regions forming a rectangle.
    actions:
        - find_pixels: Identifies the location of all yellow pixels.
        - calculate_center: Computes the geometric center of the yellow pixels.
  - object: red_pixel
    color: red
    value: 2
    property: center
    description: A single red pixel that appears at the center of the yellow pixels, only if yellow pixels are present.
    actions:
        - add_center_pixel: place a red pixel at the center of mass of the yellow pixels
  - object: background
    color: "any color except yellow or red"
    description: background pixels are unchanged

      1.  Find all yellow pixels in the input grid.
      2.  If there are no yellow pixels, the output is identical to the input.
      3.  If there are yellow pixels, calculate their center of mass.
      4.  Copy the input grid to create an output.
      5. Change output grid pixel at the center to red.
