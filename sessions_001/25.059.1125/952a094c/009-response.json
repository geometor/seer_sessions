The primary colors involved are orange (7), red (2), blue (8), green (3), and maroon (9), with a background of white (0). The input grid appears to have a hollow, rectangular, orange \"frame.\" Inside this frame are other colored pixels. The output grid seems to maintain the orange frame but rotates the colors within it to a new position.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This frame occupies rows 3-8 and columns 3-8.\n\n2.  **Isolate Inner Pixels:** Identify all non-white and non-orange pixels located within the boundaries of the orange frame. Specifically, these are in positions `[3,3], [3, 6], [6, 3], [6, 6]` in the input.\n\n3.  **Extract inner colors:** Extract the color values that are not part of the frame (not 0 or 7) and create an array of these color values.\n\n4. **Swap inner positions**: replace colors from the inner frame with the values from this array in reverse. The mapping is as follows:\n    *   `[3,3]` -> `[1,8]`\n    *   `[3,6]` -> `[1,1]`\n    *   `[6,3]` -> `[8,8]`\n    *   `[6,6]` -> `[8,1]`\n\n5.  **Generate Output:** Create a new grid with the orange frame identical to the input. Fill in the identified inner positions by swapping colors. Leave all other pixels white (0).\n\nEssentially the program performs a positional swap, placing the extracted color in a predefined location.\n"
