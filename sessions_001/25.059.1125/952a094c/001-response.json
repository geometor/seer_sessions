The core concept appears to be identifying a closed shape, defined by a continuous border of a single color, and extracting the colors *inside* that shape and the color of the bounding shape. The output grid seems to mirror the input grid's dimensions, but only includes the \"inner\" colors of the enclosed shape, and the bordering color in specific positions. The position and order of inner colors in the output looks important.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Order of placement should match order within the input grid, going clockwise (or anti-clockwise, needs to be confirmed with more examples).\n    *   All other cells in the output grid, except for the enclosed shape's border, remain '0' (white).\n\nThe critical part I'm not 100% sure of is the consistent mapping of *which* inner color goes to *which* output corner. The provided examples suggest a spatial relationship, but more data would be needed to nail this detail down. It seems like a clockwise, or perhaps spiral inward from topleft mapping.\n"
