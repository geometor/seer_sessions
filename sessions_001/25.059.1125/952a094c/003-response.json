Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 10x10 grid with a central \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape formed by azure (8) pixels. Inside the cross, there are four pixels of different colors (yellow=4, green=3, red=2, magenta=6). The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.\n*   **Output:** A 10x10 grid similar to the input. The azure (8) cross remains the same. The colored pixels inside the cross are gone (replaced by 0),. There are single color pixels present in the rows just above and below the central cross in the output: magenta(6), red(2), green(3), and yellow(4).\n* The transformation involves the internal colored pixels to the border and the azure cross remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
