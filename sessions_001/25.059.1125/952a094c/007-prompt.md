Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all connected regions of pixels with color 8 (azure). These regions can have any shape.
2.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Find single, non-black, non-azure pixels that are *directly adjacent* (up, down, left, or right, but *not* diagonal) to the azure region(s).
3. **Reposition target pixels:**
    *   If the target pixel is *above* the azure region, move it to the second row (index 1) of the grid, keeping its original column.
    *   If the target pixel is *to the left* of the azure region, move it to the second-to-last row (index -2) of the grid, keeping its original column.
    *   Set the original position to black (color 0).
    *  If it is below or to the right, leave it unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
