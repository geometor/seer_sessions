# Imagined output of analyze_example for each training pair:

Example 1:
Input: (Prints the grid)
Expected Output: (Prints the grid)
Predicted Output: (Prints the grid)
Differences: None (assuming initial example was correct)
Border: (1,5, 2,6)  # Example coordinates
Inner Objects: [((2,3), 2), ((4,5), 3)]
Mirrored Positions: [((4,5), 2), ((2,3), 3)]

Example 2:
Input: (Prints the grid)
Expected Output: (Prints the grid)
Predicted Output: (Prints the grid)
Differences:
 - Pixel (3,4) expected: 5, predicted: 0
 - Pixel (3,5) expected: 0, predicted: 5
Border: (1,5, 2,7)
Inner Objects:  [((3,4),5)]
Mirrored Positions: [((3,5),5)]

Example 3:
