The input grid appears to contain several distinct colored regions or \"objects.\" The output grid seems to be a simplified, lower-resolution representation of the input, retaining some of the color information but significantly reducing the size and detail. There's a noticeable reduction in the number of rows and columns. The output grid maintains some relative spatial relationships between colors found in the input. For example, colors present near each other in the input also appear next to each other in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It is not a fixed block size - the division is organic, based on clusters of the same color surrounded by the background color (0/white).\n2.  **Identify** the dominant color within each block. If a block contains a significant single color, it's selected; if mixed, check whether the background color 0 is present - if not, proceed to the next step, or else treat all as 0.\n3. **Identify** distinct regions within the input - blocks that share the same non-zero color and border color.\n4.  **Create** a new, smaller output grid.\n5.  **Map** each identified block from the input grid to a corresponding cell in the output grid.\n6.  **Assign** the identified dominant color of the input block to the corresponding output cell.\n7. If there are multiple non-background colors within a block, prioritize colors other than 0, and preserve adjacency with other identified blocks, using relative location from input.\n\nIn essence, the transformation downsamples the input grid, representing larger regions with single colors in the output grid, favoring non-background colors and trying to preserve basic spatial relationships.\n"
