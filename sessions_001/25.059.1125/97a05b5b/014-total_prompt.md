Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The grids contain numerical values representing different colors. The input grid is larger and contains a variety of shapes and colors, while the output grid is smaller and seems to be a condensed or extracted version of a region within the input grid. The colors present are white (0), red (2), yellow (4), and green (3). The input grid features distinct regions: a large red shape in the upper section, and several smaller, disconnected shapes, (yellow and green) in the lower section.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 20x10
      - colors: [0, 2, 4, 3]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 8x8
      - colors: [2, 4, 3]
  - type: shape
    properties:
      - name: large_red_shape
      - color: 2
      - location: upper_section_input_grid
      - bounded_by: 0
  - type: shape
    properties:
      - name: yellow_shapes
      - color: 4
      - location: lower_section_input_grid
  - type: shape
      - name: green_shapes
      - color: 3
      - location: lower_section_input_grid

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A sub-region of the input grid is extracted to form the output grid.

relationships:
  - output_grid is_a_subregion_of input_grid
  - all_colors_in_output_grid are_present_in input_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** Locate the section within the larger, input grid that contains *all* of the non-red and non-white colored pixels from the bottom section of the input array. Specifically, look for the yellow (4) and green (3) pixels.
2.  **Define Boundaries:** Find the bounding rectangle that perfectly encompasses *only* the region of interest *and* some additional red (2) pixels around these non-red and non-white pixels.
3. **Crop and extract.** Extract the region of interest from the top left corner of the smallest bounding rectangle.
4.  **Construct the Output:** The extracted and cropped sub-grid is the output grid.

Essentially, the output grid is a zoomed-in, cropped section of the input grid, focusing on the area where yellow and green pixels are. The boundaries of this section also include red pixels, that provide the context and structure of the sub-region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
