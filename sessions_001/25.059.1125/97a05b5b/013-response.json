The grids contain numerical values representing different colors. The input grid is larger and contains a variety of shapes and colors, while the output grid is smaller and seems to be a condensed or extracted version of a region within the input grid. The colors present are white (0), red (2), yellow (4), and green (3). The input grid features distinct regions: a large red shape in the upper section, and several smaller, disconnected shapes, (yellow and green) in the lower section.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Specifically, look for the yellow (4) and green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Define Boundaries:** Find the bounding rectangle that perfectly encompasses *only* the region of interest *and* some additional red (2) pixels around these non-red and non-white pixels.\n3. **Crop and extract.** Extract the region of interest from the top left corner of the smallest bounding rectangle.\n4.  **Construct the Output:** The extracted and cropped sub-grid is the output grid.\n\nEssentially, the output grid is a zoomed-in, cropped section of the input grid, focusing on the area where yellow and green pixels are. The boundaries of this section also include red pixels, that provide the context and structure of the sub-region.\n"
