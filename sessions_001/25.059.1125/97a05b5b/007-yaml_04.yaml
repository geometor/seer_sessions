facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2D grid of integers (pixels).
  - observation: Output is a 2D grid of integers (pixels).
  - observation: Output grid dimensions are smaller than input grid dimensions.
  - observation: Input grid contains multiple distinct colored regions.
  - observation: Output grid contains a subset of colors from the input grid.
  - observation: Spatial relationships between colors are somewhat preserved.
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 24 x 19
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 17 x 9
      - colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
  - action: Downsampling
    description: The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid.
  - action: ColorPreservation
    description: Some colors from the input are retained in the output.
  - action: SpatialRelationshipMaintenance
      description: The relative positions of some colors remain the same between input and output
