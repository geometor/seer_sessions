"""
1.  **Identify the Region of Interest:** Locate the section within the larger, input grid that contains *all* of the non-red and non-white colored pixels from the bottom section of the input array. Specifically, look for the yellow (4) and green (3) pixels.
2.  **Define Boundaries:** Find the bounding rectangle that perfectly encompasses *only* the region of interest *and* some additional red (2) pixels around these non-red and non-white pixels.
3. **Crop and extract.** Extract the region of interest from the top left corner of the smallest bounding rectangle.
4.  **Construct the Output:** The extracted and cropped sub-grid is the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was a good first attempt, focusing on identifying a region of interest based on non-red and non-white pixels, then extracting and cropping. However, the test results across multiple examples reveal some key flaws:

1.  **Incorrect Region Identification:** The original logic assumes the region of interest *always* starts from the minimum row containing non-red/non-white pixels. This isn't always true, as seen in examples where the relevant pattern is higher up in the grid. The code extracts too much of the input grid.
2.  **Inconsistent Cropping:** The cropping logic, while aiming for the smallest rectangle, is hardcoded with an assumption about a width of 8 and adding/subtracting 2. This clearly doesn't generalize across different patterns.
3.   The start of the output pattern is relative to the rest of the input array.

The strategy to address these issues will involve:

1.  **Pattern Matching:** Instead of simply finding boundaries based on color, we need to look for a *specific* repeating pattern.
2.  **Relative Positioning:** Identify the position of the pattern *relative* to other elements, the red "border".
3.  **Dynamic Cropping:** Determine crop dimensions dynamically based on the detected pattern's size, rather than hardcoded values.

**Metrics and Observations**

I will use a python script to programmatically derive some important metrics.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(examples, transform_func):
    results = []
    for i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(examples):
        input_np = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_output_np = np.array(expected_output)
        predicted_output_np = transform_func(input_np)

        # Check if predicted output is equal to expected output.
        correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output_np, expected_output_np)

        # get the dimensions
        input_dims = input_np.shape
        
        if predicted_output_np.size != 0:
          predicted_dims = predicted_output_np.shape
        else:
          predicted_dims = (0, 0) # set dims to zero
          
        expected_dims = expected_output_np.shape

        results.append({
            "example": i + 1,
            "correct": correct,
            "input_dims": input_dims,

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Repeating Pattern:** Within the input grid, locate the largest repeating subgrid pattern consisting of green (3) and yellow (4) pixels, bordered by red (2) pixels. This pattern appears to always have two rows.
2.  **Find the Top Border:** Find the continuous horizontal line of red (2) pixels immediately *above* the identified repeating pattern.
3.  **Extract:** Extract the section of the input grid, beginning with the row of the top red border.  The height and width of this extraction will be determined in the next step.
4. **Determine the output size:** The output size is the height and width of the repeating pattern and the bordering red rows above and below.
5.  **Output:** The extracted subgrid *is* the output.

This revised natural language program shifts the focus from simply finding non-red/non-white pixels to identifying a specific *repeating pattern* and its relationship to a red border. This should be a much more robust and generalizable approach. The critical change is the emphasis on the *relative* positioning of the pattern and border, rather than absolute row indices.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
