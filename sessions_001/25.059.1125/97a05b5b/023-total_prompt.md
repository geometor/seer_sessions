Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify Region of Interest: Find the smallest rectangular subgrid (bounding box) that contains all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2. Identify Preserve and Fill Colors: Determine which non-white color within the bounding box is the "preserve" color and which is the "fill" color. The preserve color is the color of the top-left non-white pixel, and the fill color is the color immediately below it.
3. Extract Subgrid: Create a new grid representing the identified subgrid.
4. Translate and Fill: Copy pixels of the preserve color from the input subgrid to the output grid.  Fill all other pixels within the output grid with the fill color.
5. Output: Return the subgrid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
