facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves finding the smallest bounding box containing all non-white pixels.
  - object_identification: |
      The input grids contain multiple colors. One color within the bounding box is designated as the "preserve" color. Pixels of other colors within the bounding box become a "fill" color.
  - conditional_logic: |
      The choice of "preserve" and "fill" colors appears to vary between examples, suggesting conditional logic based on input characteristics.
  - example_1_2:
      preserve: azure (8)
      fill: red (2)
  - example_3:
      preserve: gray (5)
      fill: blue (1)
