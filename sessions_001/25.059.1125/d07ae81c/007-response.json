The dominant colors are azure (8), red (2), with some yellow (4) and blue (1). The output seems to be a shuffled or re-arranged version of the input, maintaining most of the color counts but with a different spatial arrangement. There's not an obvious geometric transformation like a simple rotation or reflection. The re-arrangement appears somewhat chaotic but must follow a defined rule, since the total number of pixels for each colors is similar, although not identical.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The criteria that drives the pixel location is complex and is based on the color and likely includes swapping positions of groups of pixels. The groups may not be based on simple x,y positions, but may be based on a more complex ordering process.\n3. **Output:** The result is the rearranged grid (output).\n\nThe core challenge will be defining a non-trivial rule for the order the pixels are iterated and defining the new position. The change in the color count can be considered a relaxation in an otherwise very rigid shuffling process.\n"
