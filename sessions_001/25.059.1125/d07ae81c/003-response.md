Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan for improvement:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial approach of identifying "special pixels" (those differing from the majority color) and applying a color mapping is a good starting point. However, the logic for transforming non-special pixels based on neighbor analysis is flawed and needs significant revision. The current implementation assumes a fixed rotation order among neighboring special pixel colors, which is incorrect, as evidenced by the failures in the test cases.

The strategy for improvement involves:

1.  **Refine Special Pixel Mapping:** Verify that the `special_pixel_mapping` is correct and complete by analyzing *all* training examples.
2.  **Rethink Neighbor Logic:** Abandon the fixed rotation idea. Instead, focus on *which* special colors are present in the neighborhood and *how many* of each are present. The transformation rule for non-special pixels likely depends on a combination of these factors, possibly involving a lookup table or a set of conditional rules. The *position* of the neighbors might not be as crucial as their mere presence.
3.  **Consider Objectness:** It appears that contiguous blocks of special pixels of the same color often form coherent "objects." The transformation may involve operations on these objects as a whole, rather than on individual pixels.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the revised logic against *all* training examples after each change, not just one at a time.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_accuracy(predicted_grid, expected_grid):
    """Calculates the pixel-wise accuracy between two grids."""
    return np.mean(np.array(predicted_grid) == np.array(expected_grid))

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Special Pixels:** Determine the most frequent color in the input grid (the "background" color).  All pixels *not* of this background color are "special pixels."

2.  **Special Pixel Transformation:**  Apply the following color mapping to special pixels directly:
    *   1 (blue) -> 1 (blue)
    *   2 (red) -> 2 (red)
    *   3 (green) -> 3 (green)
    *   4 (yellow) -> 4 (yellow)
    *   8 (azure) -> 8 (azure)
    *  5 (gray) -> 5 (gray)
    *  6 (magenta) -> 6 (magenta)

3.  **Background Pixel Transformation:** For each background pixel:

    *   Examine its 8 immediate neighbors (including diagonals).
    *  If gray(5) or magenta(6) is a special pixel, then don't apply any rules. The background color remains.
    *   If there are any special pixels *adjacent* to the background pixel:
        * If azure (8) pixels are present in the neighborhood, the current pixel changes to azure (8).
        * Example 3 presents alternating fills - if special pixels form patterns of vertical stripes, then fill the gap using the specified alternate colors
            - If 3 and 8 are adjacent and forming vertical stripes, fill the space between with 6
            - If 8 and 3 are adjacent and forming vertical stripes, fill the space between with 3
        * If all the above are not satisfied, but special pixels are adjacent: Example 1 has unique interactions. When blue (1) pixels are adjacent to a background pixel, it becomes azure (8). If yellow (4) is also adjacent to the now azure (8) pixel, then it is unchanged, if the yellow (4) pixel is not adjacent to any other special pixels.

4.  **Object Consideration:** If special pixels of the same color form contiguous blocks (objects), treat operations on those objects as a single unit when determining adjacency and applying transformations.

The above is the refined version of the natural language program.
