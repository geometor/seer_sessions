Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of colored pixels. The colors present are green (3), blue (1), red (2), and azure (8). The most salient changes are the appearances of many red (2) pixels and a few strategically placed azure (8) pixels. The overall shapes formed by green and blue remain consistent. The position of the original single red pixel and some azure pixels appear influential.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 12
      columns: 15
      colors: [1, 2, 3, 8] # Blue, Red, Green, Azure
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: int (0-9)
      position: (row, col)
  - type: region
    properties:
      color: int
      shape: varies # Could be rectangular, blob-like, etc.

actions:
  - name: flood_fill_adjacent
    parameters:
      start_pixel: (row, col)
      replacement_color: int
      target_color: int
      diagonal: boolean

relationships:
    - type: adjacency
      description: Pixels sharing a side or corner.
    - type: containment
      description: Regions can contain pixels and other regions.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Locate all pixels of color 8 (azure) and the single pixel that is color 2(red) in the input grid.

2.  **Propagate Azure:** For each azure pixel, perform a flood-fill operation, replacing adjacent blue (1) pixels with azure, but only once per seed pixel, and not diagonally.

3.  **Propagate Red:** For *each* blue (1) pixel adjacent to the initially identified single input red (2) pixel perform a flood-fill of red (2)s, and replace adjacent blue(1) pixel, but only once per seed pixel. Extend this to include diagonals.

In essence, the transformation "grows" azure and red regions from their initial positions, but it prioritizes filling blues adjacent to initial seed pixels with the respective color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
