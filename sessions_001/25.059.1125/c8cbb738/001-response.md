Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements appear to be 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grids are larger and more complex than the output grids. The transformation seems to involve a significant reduction in size and a selection of specific pixels. The output grids appear to maintain relative spatial arrangement, with border pixels. The dominant color of input is replaced with another in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (MxN)
      - cells: pixels
      - colors: integers (0-9, mapped to colors)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    description: Selects a smaller grid from the input.
  - name: identify_non_dominant_colors
    description: Finds colors other than the most frequent one.
  - name: filter_by_position_and_color
    description: Keeps certain colors and relative position from outer layer.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Output grid pixels maintain some relative spatial relationships from the input grid, especially border colors.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Dominant Color:** Determine the most frequent color in the input grid. This color will be considered the "background" and will be replaced.

2.  **Identify Target Colors:** Identify all colors present in the input grid that are *not* the dominant color.

3. **Extract Outer Layer:** From the input grid create a new grid by extracting all the non dominant colored pixels, reducing input to an MxM matrix, and maintaining their original positions relative to each other.

4. **Replace Dominant:** In the extracted outer layer, replace remaining pixels of the dominant color with target colors

5.  **Form Output Grid:** Construct the output grid from this outer layer.
