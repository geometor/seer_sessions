Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid appears to be mostly filled with the value '3' (green), with a few other colors appearing sporadically. The output grid seems to extract or represent a condensed version of the input, retaining only certain colors and their spatial relationships, specifically a 5x5 square. It's notable how much smaller the output is.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 12x11
        elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 5x5
        elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: color_patches
    properties:
      - colors: [1, 2, 4, 8] # Blue, Red, Yellow, Azure
        locations: variable within input_grid

actions:
  - type: extraction
    description: A smaller 5x5 grid is extracted from the input grid.
  - type: filtering
    description: Only specific colors from the input are retained in the output.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains color_patches
  - output_grid represents a filtered and condensed version of the input_grid
  - spatial_relationship: The relative positions of the non-green colors in the input grid are somewhat maintained in the output grid, but scaled down.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Region:** Locate the non-green colors within the input grid. Notice that the output corresponds to the smallest bounding box of the non green values plus one green value padding on all sides.

2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract a 5x5 sub-grid from the input grid, positioned to maintain relative placements of non-green colors. The extracted subgrid contains only non green and the color green (3).

3. **Output Sub-Grid:** output the extracted 5 x 5 subgrid.

In summary the input grid reduces to just the non-green elements within a bounding, square, sub-grid with green (3) padding.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
