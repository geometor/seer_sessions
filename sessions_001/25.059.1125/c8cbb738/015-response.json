The input grid seems to be mostly filled with yellow (4) pixels, with a few blue (1) and orange (7) pixels scattered within. The output grid appears to extract and consolidate these non-yellow pixels, while maintaining their relative horizontal and vertical positioning. The output grid is significantly smaller.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These are the target pixels.\n2.  **Extract and Record Positions:** For each target pixel, record its color and its original row and column position within the input grid.\n3. Determine new position in output grid: Determine the maximum row and maxiumn colum the target pixels occur at, and compress the target cells down to origin (0,0)\n4. **Create Output Grid and fill target cells:** create a new grid, fill the identified target cells with their recorded color.\n5.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill any remaining values of the output grid with the background yellow color (4).\n\nEssentially, the program extracts the \"interesting\" pixels (non-yellow) and creates a condensed representation of their arrangement, all other cells will default to 4.\n"
