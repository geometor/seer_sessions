The input grids are larger and more complex than the output grids. The transformation seems to involve a significant reduction in size and a selection of specific pixels. The output grids appear to maintain relative spatial arrangement, with border pixels. The dominant color of input is replaced with another in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
