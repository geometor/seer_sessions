The output is a much smaller grid, also with colored pixels, seemingly derived from a specific region within the input grid. The colors in the output grid appear to be a subset of those present in the input, with a notable presence of the color 6 (magenta). The output appears to maintain the arrangement of the input.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
