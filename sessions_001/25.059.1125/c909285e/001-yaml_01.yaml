facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain repeating patterns of colored pixels.
  - object_identification: |
      The repeating patterns can be considered individual objects.
  - object_properties: |
      Objects have shape (defined by pixel arrangement), size, and color composition.
  - actions: |
      The transformation extracts a single instance of the repeating object.
      The background seems to become a single color surrounding the extracted object.
  - relationships:
      The input is composed of multiple instances of the same object, tiled across the grid.
      The output isolates and represents a single, "core" object instance.
  - background: |
      The input background consists of multiple colours forming a "frame" for the repeating objects.
      The output background is one of the background colors of the object's frame.
