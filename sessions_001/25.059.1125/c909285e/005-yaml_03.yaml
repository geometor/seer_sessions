facts:
  - object: flower
    properties:
      - shape: cross-like pattern
      - center: color 3 (green)
      - petals: colors 0 (white), 2 (red), 4 (yellow), 8 (azure) in specific positions relative to the center.
      - size: typically 7x7 area when fully present
    actions:
      - identified: by finding the center pixel (color 3)
      - extracted: a 7x7 region centered on the identified center is isolated
      - transformed: pixels within the 7x7 region that are NOT part of the defined flower pattern are replaced with color 3 (green)
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers 0-9 representing colors
    actions:
        - input: the initial grid containing the flower pattern
        - output: contains only the identified flower, with all pixels not identified as flower being set to color 3 (green)
