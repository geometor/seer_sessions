The output is a significantly smaller grid (7x7) also filled with single-digit numbers/colors.  The output grid seems to be a highly abstracted \"summary\" or \"core sample\" of the input grid, with a focus on a specific, repeating pattern. A large area of the color red (2) frames the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
