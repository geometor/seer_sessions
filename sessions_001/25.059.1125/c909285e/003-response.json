The output is a smaller grid (7x7) that seems to be a condensed or abstracted representation of a section of the input grid. The input has repeating patterns of a shape, a sort of flower, composed by different colors. The center of one flower is made by color 3 (green), while other flowers have a center of color 5 (gray). The output grid captures the top-left \"flower\", keeping the original colors in the flower and changing all surrounding pixels to 3(green)\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The flower is defined by arrangement of the colors 0, 2, 4, and 8 around a center of 5, except for top-left flower that its center is 3.\n2.  **Extract:** Create a 7x7 grid by extracting the pixels of the identified flower shape from the input grid.\n3. **Background Filling:** All pixels that are *not* part of the extracted flower must be changed to the color 3 (green).\n4.  **Output:** The resulting 7x7 grid is the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation isolates and extracts a specific instance of a repeating pattern, replacing the rest of the grid with a uniform color.\n"
