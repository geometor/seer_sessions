  - example_1:
      objects:
        - color: gray (5)
          shape: contiguous region
          initial_position: [(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6), (4,7), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)]
          action: partial expansion
          notes: "The gray region expands only around the blue pixel, filling gaps within its perimeter"
        - color: blue (1)
          shape: single pixel
          initial_position: [(4, 5)]
          action: expansion
          notes: expands into a 3x1 region, bounded by grey
      transformation: "Selective expansion of gray region around blue pixel and expansion of blue within gray bounds."

  - example_2:
      objects:
        - color: gray (5)
          shape: contiguous region
          initial_position: [(1,3),(1,4),(1,5), (2,2),(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,3),(3,4),(3,5)]
          action: partial expansion
          notes: fills gaps in the perimeter
        - color: blue (1)
          shape: single pixel
          initial_position:  [(2, 4)]
          action: expands into a 3x1 region, bounded by grey

      transformation: "Selective expansion of gray region and expansion of blue within gray bounds."

          shape: single pixel
          initial_position: [(5, 9)]
          action: expands to 3x1, bounded by grey
