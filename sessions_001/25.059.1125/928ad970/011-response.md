Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to expand blue objects by one layer into adjacent white cells, while preserving other colors. The provided results show that this works perfectly for the first example, but encounters issues with subsequent examples. The core issue arises when expanding the blue objects results in overwriting adjacent non-white pixels. The current strategy needs refinement: we must ensure expansion of blue *only* into adjacent white pixels, and *strictly* avoid overwriting non-white pixels, while still retaining non-blue colors from the original grid.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformation, let's define some properties and collect associated metrics. Here is an analysis of the training input/output grids:

```python
def analyze_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    color_counts = {color: np.sum(grid == color) for color in unique_colors}
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    bounding_box_area = rows * cols
    return {
        'shape': (rows, cols),
        'unique_colors': unique_colors.tolist(),
        'color_counts': color_counts,
        'bounding_box_area': bounding_box_area
    }

def compare_grids(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid):
        input_analysis = analyze_grid(input_grid)
        output_analysis = analyze_grid(output_grid)
        predicted_output_analysis = analyze_grid(predicted_output_grid)

        return{
          'input':input_analysis,
          'output':output_analysis,
          'predicted': predicted_output_analysis
        }

# Example usage (assuming the existence of train_input_0, train_output_0, predicted_output_0, etc.)
examples = {}
for i in range(len(task_data['train'])): # Use len(task_data['train']) instead of hardcoding 3
    input_grid = task_data['train'][i]['input']
    output_grid = task_data['train'][i]['output']
    predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
    comparison = compare_grids(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_output_grid)
    examples[f'example_{i}'] = comparison

import json
print(json.dumps(examples, indent=2))

```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The primary transformation involves blue objects.  Other colored objects
      are present and should be preserved.
  - object: blue_region
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      behavior: expands outwards
    constraints:
      expansion_limit: white (0) pixels only
  - object: other_colored_region
    properties:
      color: any color other than blue (not 1)
      behavior: static (remains unchanged)
  - action: expansion
    description: |
      Blue regions expand by one pixel in all cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
    precondition: adjacent cell is white (0)
    postcondition: adjacent cell becomes blue (1) if it was white (0)
  - rule: |
      Colors in the output grid are determined as follows: if the input grid cell is blue,
      then the cell and any directly adjacent white cells become blue; all other cells
      retain their original colors.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Blue Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Conditional Expansion:** For each blue region, expand it outwards by one pixel in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right). This expansion *only* occurs if the adjacent cell is currently white (0).

3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not blue in the input grid, and are not directly adjacent to a blue pixel in the direction of expansion, must retain their original color in the output grid. Do *not* change their values.
