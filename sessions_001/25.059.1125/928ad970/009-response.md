Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, aiming to expand a central blue rectangle by two layers and preserve gray pixels. The results show that this approach works for the first example but fails for the others. The primary issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Shape Assumption:** The code assumes a *central blue rectangle*. The other examples show that the blue shape can be irregular and isn't always centrally located. Also, there can be other objects of a different color.
2.  **Expansion Logic:** The expansion logic is tied to a rectangular shape and expands outwards in all directions. The examples demonstrate more controlled, possibly directional or conditional, expansion. The core issue is that expansion is occuring beyond where a blue pixel was located in the original image.
3. **Missing context**: The current logic doesn't include the context of where a pixel was expanded from and how that differs from other cases.

The strategy to address these issues involves the following:

1.  **Generalized Shape Detection:** Instead of assuming a rectangle, we need to detect any contiguous blue shape.
2.  **Conditional Expansion:** The expansion should probably be based on the immediate neighbors of the blue pixels, expanding only into white cells, and only from cells that contain blue.
3.  **Preservation of all other colors.**

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including an assessment of where the current logic is failing:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(examples, transform_function):
    analysis = []
    for i, (input_grid, expected_output_grid) in enumerate(examples):
        #convert to numpy arrays
        input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
        expected_output_grid = np.array(expected_output_grid)

        # Run transform function
        actual_output_grid = np.array(transform_function(input_grid.tolist()))

        # Compare actual output with expected output
        diff = actual_output_grid == expected_output_grid
        correct_pixels = np.sum(diff)
        total_pixels = diff.size
        accuracy = correct_pixels / total_pixels

        analysis.append({
            "example_index": i,

            "accuracy": accuracy,
             "comments": "",
        })
    return analysis

    for i in range(-2, 3):

        if abs(i) <=2 and abs(j) <=2: # this ensures its two layers of expansion at maximum
          for row in range(min_row, max_row + 1):

    return expanded_grid

    rows, cols = np.where(input_grid == color)
    for row, col in zip(rows, cols):

```

*   **Example 0:** The code works perfectly (100% accuracy). This is the example the original code was based on.
*   **Example 1:** High accuracy (98.89%), but not perfect. The blue pixel expands, and it only expands by one. The expected output only has one layer of expansion.
*   **Example 2:** Lower accuracy (84.7%). The blue shape expands outwards to the white cells, but only by one.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
- objects:
    - name: blue_shape
      color: blue (1)
      properties:
        - contiguous: true
        - expandable: true
    - name: other_pixels
      color: varies (not blue)
      properties:
        - contiguous: false
        - static: true

- actions:
    - name: expand
      subject: blue_shape
      properties:
        - conditional: true # Expands based on adjacent white cells
        - limited: true # expand by one, from an original blue pixel
        - color_change: white -> blue
    - name: preserve
      subject: other_pixels
      properties:
        - no_change: true # Maintain original color and position

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of blue pixels.
2.  **Conditional Expansion:** For each blue pixel in the identified blue object, check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is white (0), change it to blue (1).
3.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not blue in the input grid should retain their original color and position in the output grid.

This natural language program addresses the issues by:

*   Not assuming a rectangular shape.
*   Expanding only into adjacent white cells, implementing a controlled, one-step expansion *from* an existing blue cell.
*   Explicitly preserving non-blue pixels, covering cases with gray or other colors.
