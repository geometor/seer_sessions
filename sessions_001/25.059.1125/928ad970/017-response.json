The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), yellow (4), and white (0).  The transformation appears to involve expanding or \"inflating\" the yellow (4) region outwards, while maintaining the positions of isolated gray (5) pixels. The expansion respects a certain set of rules.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
