Some are single pixels (like color 5), and others are connected regions of the same color (like colors 1, 3, and 4).\n*   **Background:** The color 0 (white) seems to act as a background.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve \"inflating\" or \"expanding\" the colored regions (excluding color 5, gray) outwards, creating a border of the object's color around the original shape, one pixel at a time in all the non-diagonal directions. The gray (5) single pixels remain.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This means adding a one-pixel border of the same color around the existing region. Specifically, any background (color 0) pixel that is directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of a pixel in the region becomes the region's color.\n3.  **Preserve Single Pixels:** The single gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.\n4. **Output:** The modified grid after the expansion is the output.\n\nIn essence, the core transformation is an outward expansion (or \"inflation\") of colored regions by one pixel, while single gray pixels remain.\n"
