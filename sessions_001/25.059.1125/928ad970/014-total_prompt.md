Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A grid with gray (5), green (3), and white (0) pixels. The gray pixels seem to act as "anchors" or "markers". The green pixels form a connected shape.
*   **Output:** The same grid, but with an expanded green area. The green area in the output extends outwards from its original position in the input, forming a larger, connected region, like a filled outline. The gray pixels remain in the same positions. White pixels are mostly unchanged, filling any area not part of another object.
* The input green object becomes a hollow object in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: gray_pixels
    color: gray (5)
    properties:
      - static: true  # Their positions don't change
      - role: anchor

  - name: green_pixels
    color: green (3)
    properties:
      - dynamic: true # Their positions change
      - shape: contiguous_block
      - state: solid #initial state

  - name: white_pixels
    color: 'white (0)'
    properties:
      - role: background

actions:
  - name: expand_green
    object: green_pixels
    description: Green area expands outwards in all directions.
  - name: hollow_green
    object: green_pixels
    description: the original green block becomes a hollow

relationships:
  - gray_pixels act as boundaries or reference points for the expansion.
  - green area expansion respects the grid boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the gray (5) pixels in the input grid. These remain unchanged in the output.
2.  **Identify** the connected green (3) pixels in the input.
3.  **Hollow** out the original green pixels - expand green pixels in all directions by one cell.
4.  **Fill**: Any cell, not part of any other object (gray or hollowed green object), becomes, or remains, white.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
