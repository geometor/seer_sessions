  description: Fill in missing numbers in a repeating sequence.

observations:
  - example_1:
    input:
      objects:
        - type: grid
          properties:
            dimensions: 5x5
            sequence: "1 2 3 4 5" repeating horizontally and vertically, with one missing value (0)
            missing_value_location: (1,1)
    output:
        - type: grid
          properties:
            dimensions: 5x5
            sequence: "1 2 3 4 5" repeating horizontally and vertically, complete.
            filled_value: 3 at (1,1)
    transformation:
      action: Replace the '0' with the correct value from the repeating sequence.
  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - type: grid
            properties:
              dimensions: 8x8
              sequence: "1 2 3 4 5" repeating, with two '0' values.
              missing_value_locations: (1,6), (2,3)
      output:
          - type: grid
            properties:
              dimensions: 8x8
              sequence: complete
              filled_values: 3 at (1,6) and 1 at (2,3).
      transformation:
        action: Replace the '0's with appropriate number in repeating sequence
  - example_3:
    input:
        objects:
          - type: grid
            properties:
              dimensions: 12x12
              sequence: numbers, repeating, starting with 2. one '0' value
              missing_value: (11,11)
    output:
        objects:
          - type: grid
            properties:
              dimensions: 12x12
              sequence: "1 2 3 4 5" repeating, numbers, complete starting with 2, and one '0'
    transformation:
      action: Replace '0' with the correct number in sequence.
