The input grid appears to have a repeating pattern of '1 2 3 4 5', both horizontally and vertically. There are areas of '0' (white) pixels within this pattern. The output grid seems to simplify or \"clean up\" the input by removing the white pixels (0s), completing the 1-5 sequence.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This sequence occurs horizontally across rows and vertically down columns.\n\n2.  **Locate Disruptions:** Identify the pixels with a value of '0' (white) that disrupt the \"1 2 3 4 5\" sequence.\n\n3.  **Restore Sequence:** Replace each '0' pixel with the value that would continue the \"1 2 3 4 5\" sequence, based on its position relative to its non-zero neighbors, both horizontally and vertically. That means in each row and column, the 0 is replaced by the number from the sequence.\n\nEssentially the zeros are place holders for the sequence, removing the zeros maintains the pattern.\n"
