      details: >
        The path extends either vertically or horizontally first to align
        on an axis, then extends in the other axis to connect.
        The provided diff files show that the line may extend in either
        direction, but is off by one pixel at times.
  - constraints:
      - The path must be made of azure pixels.
      - The path should be the shortest rectilinear path.
