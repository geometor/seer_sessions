Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Key Pixels:** Find the positions (row, column) of the red (2) and green (3) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Azure Line Column:** The vertical azure (8) line will be in the same column as the green pixel.
3.  **Determine the Azure Line Start and End row:** The line will start at the row where the red pixel is located. The line will extend downwards to the row immediately above the green pixel.
4.  **Draw Azure Line:** Create a vertical line of azure (8) pixels in the specified column, starting and ending at the determined rows.
5.  **Preserve All Input Pixels:** Ensure all of the original input pixels are in the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
