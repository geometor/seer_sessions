The primary colors observed are green (3) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve changing some of the white (0) pixels to red (2). The overall grid structure (dimensions) remains identical between input and output. The key seems to lie in *which* white pixels are changed, and what determines this selection. It appears to be a very localized, possibly a neighbor based, replacement.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
