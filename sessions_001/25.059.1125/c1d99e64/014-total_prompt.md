1.  Find the Center: Determine the center column of the input grid.
2.  Identify White Lines: Find all contiguous vertical lines of white (0) pixels that intersect the center column.
3. Find Longest Line: Identify the longest of these vertical white lines. If multiple lines have the same maximal length, it appears that all are changed, so step 3 is included in step 2.
4.  Determine Replacement Color: Find a color from the set [1, 2, 3, 4] that is *not* present in the input grid.
5.  Replace Pixels: Replace all white pixels in the identified longest line(s) that intersect the center column with the determined replacement color.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The subsequent tests reveal that the logic is not universally applicable to all examples. The primary issue seems to be an over-specificity to the features of the first example (specifically, focusing solely on the *center* column). Other examples demonstrate that the vertical white lines can exist and be transformed anywhere in the grid, not just at the center. The replacement color logic is correct.

The strategy for improvement is to:

1.  **Generalize Line Detection:** Modify the logic to detect *all* vertical white lines in the grid, not just those intersecting the center column.
2.  **Maintain Replacement Logic:** The existing color replacement logic is valid and should be kept.
3.  **Verify through Code Execution:** Utilize `code_execution` to generate reports about grid characteristics (size, colors, white line positions) to confirm observations.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Let's analyze each example and gather metrics using code execution where appropriate.

```python
import numpy as np

def report(grid, grid_name):
    """Generates a report on the grid's properties."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    white_lines = []
    for col in range(cols):
        in_segment = False
        start_row = -1
        for row in range(rows):
            if grid[row, col] == 0:
                if not in_segment:
                    in_segment = True
                    start_row = row
            elif in_segment:
                in_segment = False
                white_lines.append((start_row, row - 1, col))
                start_row = -1
        if in_segment:
            white_lines.append((start_row, rows - 1, col))

    max_white_line_length = 0
    if white_lines:
        max_white_line_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end, _ in white_lines)
    
    print(f"Report for {grid_name}:")
    print(f"  Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}")
    print(f"  Unique Colors: {unique_colors}")
    print(f"  White Lines (start_row, end_row, col): {white_lines}")
    print(f"  Max White Line Length: {max_white_line_length}")

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: vertical_white_lines
    description: Contiguous lines of white (0) pixels.
    properties:
      - length: Variable, can be different for each line.
      - position: Can exist in any column of the grid.
      - color: Always white (0).
  - action: replace_color
    description: Changes the color of the longest vertical white lines.
    properties:
      - replacement_color: A color from the set [1, 2, 3, 4] not present in the input grid.
      - target: The longest vertical white line(s).

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify All Vertical White Lines:** Find all contiguous vertical lines of white (0) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Find Longest Lines:** Determine the maximum length among all identified vertical white lines.
3.  **Select Longest Lines:** Select all vertical white lines that have the maximum length.
4.  **Determine Replacement Color:** Identify a color from the set \[1, 2, 3, 4] that is *not* present in the input grid.
5.  **Replace Pixels:** Replace all pixels in the selected longest vertical white lines with the determined replacement color.

This revised program addresses the generalization issue by considering all vertical white lines and accurately describes the transformation process observed across all training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
