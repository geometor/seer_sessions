Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The colors present are white (0), yellow (4), and gray (5). There appears to be a transformation happening where some parts of the grid are removed or altered. Specifically, it looks like the gray (5) colored pixels are being manipulated, with some being completely removed.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: yellow_rectangle
    type: rectangle
    color: yellow (4)
    position:
      top_left: [1, 1]
      bottom_right: [3, 7]
    properties:
      static: true
  - id: gray_structure_1
    type: irregular shape
    color: gray (5)
    position: # Initial position in input
      top_left: [4,3]
      area: [[4, 3], [5, 3], [6, 3], [7, 3], [8, 2], [9, 2], [10, 2], [8, 3], [8, 4], [8, 5], [9, 3], [9, 4], [9, 5], [10, 3], [10, 4], [10, 5] ]
    properties:
        static: false
  - id: gray_structure_2
    type: rectangle
    color: gray(5)
    position:
        top_left: [4, 2]
        bottom_right: [6,7]
    properties:
        static: false

actions:
  - type: removal
    target: part of gray_structure_1
    description:  Pixels of gray_structure_1 that form a vertical structure from [4,3] to [7,3] is removed.
  - type: shift
    target: part of gray_structure_1
    description: The remaining pixels of gray_structure_1 which consist of [8, 2], [9, 2], [10, 2], [8, 3], [8, 4], [8, 5], [9, 3], [9, 4], [9, 5], [10, 3], [10, 4], [10, 5] are combined and moved to form rectangle [4,2] to [6,7].

relationships:
  - yellow_rectangle: unchanged
  - gray_structure_1: partially removed and remaining is moved and form a rectangle

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Stable Objects:** Find the rectangular region of yellow (4) pixels. This area remains unchanged.
2.  **Identify the object composed of gray(5):** Find the gray object.
3. **Segment object:** If gray object is not rectangular. Segment into sub-objects. One with single gray pixel per row, another consisting the remaining pixel.
4.  **Process Gray object:** Gray sub-object with one gray pixel per row in the input is completely removed. The other gray sub-object is combined to form a rectangle.
5.  **Output:** The final output consists of the unchanged yellow rectangle and processed gray object.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
