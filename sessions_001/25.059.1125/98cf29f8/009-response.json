Both grids are 18x13 and contain pixels of different colors, represented by integers (0-9). The primary colors present are white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The input grid has a large red rectangle and a smaller, irregular yellow shape to its left. The output grid seems to modify the positioning of yellow shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify the shape of the yellow object, represented as relative x,y and values.\n3.  Move the yellow shape.\n4.  The yellow shape's new position starts from the red shape x position in the input. The new shape aligns the yellow pixels to form a regular, 3x3, rectangle aligned vertically with the red rectangle's top edge.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule involves repositioning the yellow shape relative to the red rectangle, creating a vertically aligned, smaller rectangle from an irregular shape.\n"
