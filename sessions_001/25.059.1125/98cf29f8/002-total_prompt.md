<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3392x2256 at 0x7F4C1A5889D0>Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating colored objects within a grid. The primary colors involved are yellow (4), grey (5), red (2), and green (3).  The transformation seems to involve a selective "movement" or "re-drawing" of colored regions, specifically those connected in certain shapes. The background is always white (0) and isn't directly part of the main transformation. It looks like certain connected colored regions are being deleted and other parts, re-drawn, perhaps on the basis of the deleted part.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: yellow_region
    color: yellow (4)
    shape: rectangle
    properties:
      - contiguous
  - name: grey_region
    color: grey (5)
    shape: rectangle
    properties:
      - contiguous
  - name: red_region
    color: red (2)
    shape: rectangle
    properties:
      - contiguous
  - name: green_region
    color: green (3)
    shape: rectangle, sometimes with a single-pixel extension
    properties:
      - contiguous

actions:
  - name: delete_part
    description: Removes a specific connected colored region from the grid.
  - name: redraw_part
    description: re-draw the other part of the connected region.

relationships:
    - yellow_region is connected to gray_region
    - red_region is connected to yellow_region
    - green_region is connected to red_region.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify connected regions:** Find all contiguous regions of pixels with the same color. Specifically look for regions forming an L shape or T shape.
2. **Determine the part to be delete and redraw.**
  - case 1: if there are two connected regions. If one of the objects is yellow and
    another is grey. Delete grey region. The part of the yellow object that
    is connected to the gray object is also deleted.
  - case 2: if there are two connected objects. If one of the objects is red and
    another is yellow. Delete the yellow region and redraw the yellow region
    immediately next to red object. The part of the yellow object that is
    connected to the red object is not deleted.
  - case 3. if there are two connected objects, one of which includes one color
    of red and another color of green. If the object composed of red color is
    connected on the top side of the object composed of green color, the
    object composed of red color object is deleted and the object composed of
    green color is kept.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
