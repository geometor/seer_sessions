The primary colors involved are yellow (4), grey (5), red (2), and green (3).  The transformation seems to involve a selective \"movement\" or \"re-drawing\" of colored regions, specifically those connected in certain shapes. The background is always white (0) and isn't directly part of the main transformation. It looks like certain connected colored regions are being deleted and other parts, re-drawn, perhaps on the basis of the deleted part.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
