Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are 18x13 and contain pixels of different colors, represented by integers (0-9). The primary colors present are white (0), red (2), and yellow (4). The input grid has a large red rectangle and a smaller, irregular yellow shape to its left. The output grid seems to modify the positioning of yellow shape.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    color: red
    id: red_rectangle
    properties:
      - width: 8
      - height: 7
      - position: (7,3) # Top-left corner coordinates (x, y) in the input grid
  - type: irregular_shape
    color: yellow
    id: yellow_shape
    properties:
      - position: (1,5)  #approx Top-left corner coordinates (x, y)
      - shape: [[4, 4, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 0]]

actions:
 - description: The yellow shape is moved. The new shape is aligned with the left edge of the red rectangle in the input grid
 - object: yellow_shape
 - type: movement

relationships:
  - object1: yellow_shape
  - object2: red_rectangle
  - type: spatial
  - description:  yellow shape in input is beside to the left. yellow shape in output is in the position of object2 in input, on the left of object2.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the red rectangle (`red_rectangle`) and the yellow shape(`yellow_shape`) in the input grid.
2.  Identify the shape of the yellow object, represented as relative x,y and values.
3.  Move the yellow shape.
4.  The yellow shape's new position starts from the red shape x position in the input. The new shape aligns the yellow pixels to form a regular, 3x3, rectangle aligned vertically with the red rectangle's top edge.

In essence, the transformation rule involves repositioning the yellow shape relative to the red rectangle, creating a vertically aligned, smaller rectangle from an irregular shape.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
