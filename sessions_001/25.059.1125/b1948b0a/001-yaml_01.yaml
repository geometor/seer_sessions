facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object: |
      Pixels with value '6' (magenta).
  - object: |
      Pixels with value '7' (orange).
  - action: |
      Some '6' pixels are replaced with '2' (red).
  - action: |
      '7' pixels are never changed.
  - relationship: |
      The spatial position of '6' pixels determines if they are changed to '2'.
  - context:
      Only uses number and basic geometry and topology priors
      Colors: 6 is magenta, 7 is orange and 2 is red.
