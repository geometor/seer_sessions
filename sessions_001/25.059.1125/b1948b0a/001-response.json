Each integer represents a color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair.  The transformation appears to involve a color substitution, specifically changing some instances of '6' (magenta) to '2' (red), while leaving '7' (orange) unchanged. The key seems to be the *location* of the '6's.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
