Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, assuming the transformation involved filling a closed red shape with blue. While this worked for the first example, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in this assumption. The code attempts to identify interior white pixels surrounded by red pixels and fill them with blue. This approach fails in cases where:
1. there are no white pixels enclosed by red
2. multiple shapes exist
3. shapes are not completely closed

The strategy to resolve these errors involves a combination of analysis and validation:

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions**: The core assumption about "filling a closed red shape" needs revision. We need to look for a more general rule that applies to all examples.
2.  **Focus on Object Boundaries**: Instead of focusing on the interior, we should examine the boundaries of the red shapes and their properties.
3.  **Iterative Refinement**: Develop an improved natural program and code, then re-test against all examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the results (I will denote correct with ✅, incorrect with ❌):

*   **Example 1:** ✅
    *   Input: Single closed red rectangle on a white background.
    *   Output: Red rectangle with the interior filled with blue.
    *   Code Result: Correct. The flood fill within the red boundary works as expected.

*   **Example 2:** ❌
    *   Input: Single red rectangle, but not closed.
    *   Expected Output: No change should be made.
    *   Actual Code Result: No change is made, not in an intended way.

*   **Example 3:** ❌
    *   Input: Two closed red shapes on a white background.
    *    Expected output: Both should be filled blue inside
    *   Actual Code Result: No change. There is no white color surrounded by red, so the function does nothing.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - shape: rectangle
            color: red
            closed: true
            interior_color: white
      output:
        objects:
          - shape: rectangle
            color: red
            closed: true
            interior_color: blue
      transformation: Fill the interior of the closed red shape with blue.

  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - shape: rectangle
            color: red
            closed: false
            interior_color: N/A
      output:
        objects:
          - shape: rectangle
            color: red
            closed: false
            interior_color: N/A
      transformation: No change. The shape is not closed.

  - example_3:
      input:
        objects:
          - shape: irregular
            color: red
            closed: true
            interior_color: white
          - shape: rectangle
            color: red
            closed: true
            interior_color: white

      output:
        objects:
          - shape: irregular
            color: red
            closed: true
            interior_color: blue
          - shape: rectangle
            color: red
            closed: true
            interior_color: blue
      transformation: Fill the interior of all closed red shapes with blue
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of red (color 2) pixels.
2.  **Check Closure:** For each red object, determine if it forms a closed shape. A closed shape is one where all pixels of the object are connected, and no path exists from any interior point to the background without crossing the object's boundary.
3. **Fill Interior:** if an object found in previous steps is determined as
   closed, change the pixels inside the shape formed by the object as blue
   (color 1).
4.  **Preserve Boundary:** The red pixels forming the boundary of the shape should remain unchanged.
5. **Background:** The white (0) background remains unchanged.
6. **No change if not closed:** do not perform step 3 if an object is
   determined as not closed

This revised program addresses the observed issues: It correctly handles multiple shapes (Example 3) and open shapes (Example 2) by explicitly checking for closure before filling. The program also makes clear the preservation of the red boundary.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
