The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and blue (1). The transformation seems to focus on a specific shape formed by the red (2) pixels. Inside this shape, there are pixels that have their value changed.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

It could resemble a square, a more complex polygon, or even a letter-like shape. It is important to know that there is a border around the edge of the grid made of zero.\n\n2.  **Locate Enclosed Pixels:** Determine which pixels are located *inside* the closed red shape. These pixels can have different initial values, but this part of the input does not control the transformation.\n\n3.  **Change Enclosed Pixel Colors:** Change the color value of all pixels found inside the red shape to blue (1). Pixels that compose the shape remain red.\n\nIn summary, the transformation identifies a closed shape defined by red pixels and changes the color of all pixels within that shape to blue, keeping the shape outline.\n"
