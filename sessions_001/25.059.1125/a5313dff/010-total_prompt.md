Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a single digit integer (0-9). The primary colors involved are red (2), white (0), and blue (1). The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific shape formed by the red pixels and filling the interior of that shape with blue pixels while leaving the exterior unchanged. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The background is composed of white (0) pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 8x8
      elements: pixels
      background_color: 0 (white)

  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 2 (red)
      description: A closed shape resembling a star or cross.

  - type: interior
    properties:
      definition:  The region enclosed by the red shape.

  - type: pixel
    properties:
        color:
            - 0 (white)
            - 1 (blue)
            - 2 (red)

actions:
  - name: fill_interior
    description: Change the color of pixels inside the red shape to blue (1).
    constraints:
      - Only affects pixels within the red shape boundary.
      - Does not alter the red shape itself or the background.

relationships:
    - type: contains
      description: The main grid contains all the pixels, and the red shape.
    - type: inside
      description: Describes the pixels which comprise the region inside the red pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the red shape:** Locate all pixels with the value '2' (red) that form a contiguous, closed shape.
2.  **Determine the interior:** Find all pixels that are completely enclosed by the red shape identified in step 1.
3.  **Fill the Interior:** Change the value (color) of all pixels found in step 2 (inside the red shape) to '1' (blue).
4. **Preserve boundary:** The red (value of 2) pixels must be unchanged.
5. **Preserve exterior:** The exterior white space must be unchanged.
6.  **Output:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid and contains the original red shape, with its interior filled with blue, and the exterior remains white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
