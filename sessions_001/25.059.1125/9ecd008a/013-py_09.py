"""
Divide the 9x9 input grid into nine 3x3 blocks. For each block, determine a representative color.  In most cases, this is the most frequent color in the block. However, in cases similar to Example 3, Block (2,0) and (2,1) the logic must account for exceptions to this rule, favoring color 1 if present and a minority in a block otherwise dominated by color 8. Construct a 3x3 output grid where each cell's color is the representative color of the corresponding input block.
