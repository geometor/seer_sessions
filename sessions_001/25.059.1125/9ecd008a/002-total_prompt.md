**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a large, square grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a smaller 3x3 grid. The output grid seems to be a highly compressed representation of the input. The most striking feature of the input grids is a large central cross of "0" (white) pixels. The colors surrounding, and within the cross, vary. The cross's center is always empty. The output grids seem to select specific colors, one for each cell.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are square and large (e.g., 16x16).
  - observation: Output grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: Input grids contain a prominent central cross-shaped structure made of '0' (white) pixels.
  - observation: The center of the cross is always empty.
  - observation: The output grid's colors seem to correspond to colors present in the input grid, possibly related to their relative positions.
  - observation: The output grid's cells are colored and have a black border.
  - relationship: The output is likely a summarized or sampled representation of the input, focused on specific color features.
  - object: central_cross
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - shape: cross
      - location: center of the input grid
  - object: output_grid
     properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_border: black
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Locate the center of the input grid. Due to the cross structure, this is easily found as the intersection of the white (0) pixel cross.

2.  **Define Regions:** Divide the input grid into nine regions relative to the center point, corresponding to the cells of the 3x3 output grid. These are: top-left, top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right.

3. **Select Representative Color** For each of the nine sections in the output, find the non-zero value that is on the cross in that section of input. If there are multiple non-zero value that satisfy the condition, pick the one to the left and topmost.
   - Specifically, look at the input grid along the horizontal and vertical lines that make up the central cross.
   - Pick the color of the cells where these two lines cross each of the nine sections.

4.  **Populate Output:** Fill each cell of the 3x3 output grid with the representative color determined in step 3.

This program captures the essence of the transformation: extracting specific color information from defined regions of the input, relative to the central cross, and using those colors to construct the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
