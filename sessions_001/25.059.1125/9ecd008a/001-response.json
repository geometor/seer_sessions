The output grid seems to be a highly compressed representation of the input. The most striking feature of the input grids is a large central cross of \"0\" (white) pixels. The colors surrounding, and within the cross, vary. The cross's center is always empty. The output grids seem to select specific colors, one for each cell.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Due to the cross structure, this is easily found as the intersection of the white (0) pixel cross.\n\n2.  **Define Regions:** Divide the input grid into nine regions relative to the center point, corresponding to the cells of the 3x3 output grid. These are: top-left, top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right.\n\n3. **Select Representative Color** For each of the nine sections in the output, find the non-zero value that is on the cross in that section of input. If there are multiple non-zero value that satisfy the condition, pick the one to the left and topmost.\n   - Specifically, look at the input grid along the horizontal and vertical lines that make up the central cross.\n   - Pick the color of the cells where these two lines cross each of the nine sections.\n\n4.  **Populate Output:** Fill each cell of the 3x3 output grid with the representative color determined in step 3.\n\nThis program captures the essence of the transformation: extracting specific color information from defined regions of the input, relative to the central cross, and using those colors to construct the output grid.\n"
