objects:
  - name: colored_block
    properties:
      - color: [red, blue, green] #  restricts to the specified colors
      - shape: rectangle # all observed blocks are rectangular
      - unique: true # Each contiguous block of the same color is distinct.
    attributes:
       - position #relative position on the grid
       - size

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Find all distinct colored blocks in the input grid.

  - name: determine_relative_positions
    description: Calculate the relative positions of the identified blocks. Consider using centroids.
    input: list_of_blocks
    output: relative_positions # Format needs to be defined (e.g., normalized coordinates)
