Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid of colored pixels into a much smaller grid. The colors in the input grid seem to be arranged in distinct rectangular blocks. The output grid appears to retain some, but not all, of the colors from the input, and in a condensed format. The output grid's dimensions are significantly smaller than the input. The positioning is important.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - colors: [white, blue, red, azure, yellow]
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [white, azure, yellow]
  - observation: "The input grid contains distinct rectangular regions of color."
  - observation: "The output grid is smaller than the input grid."
  - observation: "The output grid contains a subset of the colors in the input."
  - observation: "There appears to be one color in the output from each major area of the input"
  - action: extract_colors
    description: "Select specific colors from input based on their relative position."
  - relationship: input_to_output
    description: "The output grid represents a condensed, color-sampled version of the input, taking the bottom-right color of regions in the input"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into large regions of contiguous colors. There are three major colored sections
2.  **Sample Colors:** Within each region, find the color of the pixel at the bottom right.
3. **Extract Color:** if a large region of the same color is adjacent, then only consider the furthest bottom right pixel
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
5. **Populate output** Place each color in the output according to the relative location of the region, so top left region is top left, bottom left is bottom left and top right is top right.

In summary, the transformation involves identifying large color regions in the input grid, sampling a single color from specific location (bottom-right) within each region, and constructing a smaller output grid using these sampled colors, arranging according to the location of the sample.
