Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program identifies 4x4 blocks of green (3) pixels within the input grid. 
The presence of red (2) pixels is not relevant.
For each identified green block, the value of the top-left pixel of each block is placed into a smaller 4x4 output grid. 
The position of the green block in the input grid determines the position of the corresponding pixel in the output grid, divided into quadrants.
If no green block is present in a quadrant, a white (0) pixel is placed in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
