Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example and made some assumptions that don't hold true for all examples. Specifically, it assumed:

1.  There are always three distinct color regions.
2.  The regions are always positioned such that sampling from their bottom-right corners will yield the colors needed for the output grid.
3.  The output grid is constructed by placing specific colors at pre-determined locations ((0,0), (2,0) and a 2x2 block with value of top_right).

The results show that these assumptions are incorrect. Some examples have more than three regions, regions have different colors, and the output construction logic is different.

The strategy to address these errors is:

1.  **Improve Region Identification:** The current `find_regions` function is very basic and doesn't handle complex region structures. The results indicate a need for more robust handling - which in later stages will require shape detection or contour finding.
2.  **Dynamic Output Construction:** Instead of hardcoding the output grid positions, derive a rule for how the input regions map to the output grid positions.
3. **Generalized color handling** Use color names in the reporting, and derive color values from data, rather than use numerical comparisons directly.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Analyze each example, identify the discrepancies between the expected and actual output, and adjust the natural language program and code accordingly.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered using `code_execution`, and a comparison of expected and actual outputs:

```python
def code_execution(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):
    """Executes code to gather metrics about the input, expected output, and actual output."""

    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    actual_output = np.array(actual_output)

    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    input_unique_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
    expected_shape = expected_output.shape
    expected_unique_colors = np.unique(expected_output)
    actual_shape = actual_output.shape
    actual_unique_colors = np.unique(actual_output)
    correct = np.array_equal(expected_output,actual_output)
    
    regions = find_regions(input_grid)
    
    num_regions = len(regions)

    print(f"  Input Shape: {input_shape}")
    print(f"  Input Unique Colors: {input_unique_colors}")
    print(f"  Number of Regions: {num_regions}")
    print(f"  Expected Output Shape: {expected_shape}")
    print(f"  Expected Unique Colors: {expected_unique_colors}")
    print(f"  Actual Output Shape: {actual_shape}")
    print(f"  Actual Unique Colors: {actual_unique_colors}")
    print(f"  Correct: {correct}")
    print(f"Regions:")
    for color, pixels in regions.items():
        print(f"    Color {color}: {pixels}")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into contiguous color regions. A region is defined as a group of adjacent pixels of the same color.
2.  **Locate Key Regions:**
    * Find the region that occupies the majority of the top and/or left portion.
    * Find the region that occupies the center-right vertically.
3.  **Sample Colors:**
    * Sample the color from the bottom-right corner of the "top/left" region, use black (0) if this is the green (3) region.
    * Sample the color from the bottom-right corner of the "middle-right" region.
    * If there is a region that spans the bottom left, sample that.
4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
    *   Place the sampled color from the top/left at the top-left (0, 0).
    *   Place the sample color from the middle-right to the top-right (0,1) and span 2 columns.
    *   If the bottom-left sample exists, put this at (2,0)
