The colors in the input grid seem to be arranged in distinct rectangular blocks. The output grid appears to retain some, but not all, of the colors from the input, and in a condensed format. The output grid's dimensions are significantly smaller than the input. The positioning is important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There are three major colored sections\n2.  **Sample Colors:** Within each region, find the color of the pixel at the bottom right.\n3. **Extract Color:** if a large region of the same color is adjacent, then only consider the furthest bottom right pixel\n4.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\n5. **Populate output** Place each color in the output according to the relative location of the region, so top left region is top left, bottom left is bottom left and top right is top right.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves identifying large color regions in the input grid, sampling a single color from specific location (bottom-right) within each region, and constructing a smaller output grid using these sampled colors, arranging according to the location of the sample.\n"
