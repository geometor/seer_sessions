facts:
  - type: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colored pixels.
    dimensions: 19x19
    elements:
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: vertical and horizontal lines, framing colored blocks
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: rectangular block, upper left
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: rectangular block, center
      - color: 3 (green)
        shape: rectangular block, lower right

  - type: output_grid
    description: A 2D array, smaller than the input, representing a distilled version of the input.
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements:
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background, most of grid
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: single pixel, top row
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single pixel, second row
      - color: 3 (green)
        shape: single pixel, bottom row

  - type: transformation
    description: Reduction and abstraction of the input grid to a smaller output grid.
    operations:
      - identify_colored_blocks: Locate distinct rectangular blocks of non-background, non-framing color.
      - select_representative_pixels: Choose one pixel from each identified block.
      - arrange_pixels: Position selected pixels in a new grid, maintaining approximate relative positions.
      - discarding: ignore azure (8) and some white (0)
