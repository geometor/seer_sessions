Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements**

The task involves transforming a large grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into a much smaller grid. The input grid appears to contain distinct rectangular blocks of color. The output grid seems to be a highly abstracted representation of the input, retaining only certain colors and possibly their relative positions, but greatly reduced in size and with many elements seemingly discarded. The colors in the output are all present in the input, so the task focuses on extraction and relayout, as opposed to generation of new information.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input_grid
    description: A 2D array of integers representing colored pixels.
    dimensions: 19x19
    elements:
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: vertical and horizontal lines, framing colored blocks
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: rectangular block, upper left
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: rectangular block, center
      - color: 3 (green)
        shape: rectangular block, lower right

  - type: output_grid
    description: A 2D array, smaller than the input, representing a distilled version of the input.
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements:
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background, most of grid
      - color: 2 (red)
        shape: single pixel, top row
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single pixel, second row
      - color: 3 (green)
        shape: single pixel, bottom row

  - type: transformation
    description: Reduction and abstraction of the input grid to a smaller output grid.
    operations:
      - identify_colored_blocks: Locate distinct rectangular blocks of non-background, non-framing color.
      - select_representative_pixels: Choose one pixel from each identified block.
      - arrange_pixels: Position selected pixels in a new grid, maintaining approximate relative positions.
      - discarding: ignore azure (8) and some white (0)
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Colored Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify distinct, contiguous rectangular blocks of pixels that are not white (0) or azure (8). Specifically, find the red (2), blue (1), and green (3) blocks.
2.  **Select Representative Pixels:** From each identified colored block (red, blue, and green), select a single pixel to represent that block.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller 4x4 grid.
4.  **Position Representative Pixels:** Place the representative pixels from each color block into the output grid. It appears these are approximately laid out from top to bottom, maintaining their original relative positions in the input grid.
5. fill the rest of the output pixels with white (0).

The azure (8) colored lines and most of the white (0) background seem to be ignored/discarded in this transformation. The essence of the transformation is to reduce the grid and represent the existence and relative positions of prominent color blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
