The primary colors observed are green (3), magenta (6), and blue (1). The input grid has a distinct pattern: alternating columns of green and magenta, with a final column of blue. The output grid seems to remove the entire rightmost blue column, and extends the magenta/green alternating pattern to the end. Also, it seems the final row of blue is removed and final column is made to have the alternating green and magenta.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
