"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify Background:** The input grid consists of green and white pixels.
2.  **Propogate White:** Any white pixel adjacent to a green pixel changes to yellow.
3. **Fill Gaps:** A single white pixel in the lower left is changed to Yellow
4. **Border:** The original border from the original image is unchanged.
5. **Corners:** A white pixel between yellow pixels in the bottom row is changed to Yellow.
