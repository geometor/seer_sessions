Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Target Shape:** Find the single contiguous shape composed of non-white pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Trace the outermost points of the shape. The output will be a filled rectangle defined by these points, and in cases where the original shape is next to a white pixel, the boundary is extended by one pixel.

3.  **Fill with Yellow:** Create a new grid where all pixels within the calculated border, and including the border, are colored yellow.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
