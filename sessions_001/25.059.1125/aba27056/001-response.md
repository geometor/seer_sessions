Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The tasks involve 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The core task seems to be related to identifying connected regions of non-zero colors and applying a transformation, potentially involving the insertion of a new color (4 - yellow) based on some criteria related to shape of those regions and background pixels..

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of integers.
    elements: Integers 0-9, representing colors.
  - type: object
    description: Non-zero colored regions form connected components.
    properties:
      - color: Represented by the integer value.
      - shape: The outline or boundary of the connected component.
      - size: Number of pixels in the component.
  - type: background
    description: pixels with color 0.
  - type: transformation_color
    description: color with value of 4 (yellow).
  - type: transformation
    description: A new shape (object) consisting of the transformation color is "drawn", with a relationship to the existing non-zero colored objects.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all connected regions (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Background:** Locate all regions (objects) of pixels with zero value
3. **Outer Border Insertion**: For every background (color 0) pixel that is directly adjacent (not diagonal) to any non-zero pixel, change color to 4 (yellow). If non-zero pixel is already adjacent to existing 4 pixel, do not perform change
4. **Inner Border Insertion**: For every non-zero pixel that is directly adjacent (not diagonal) to any background (color 0) pixel, change color to 4 (yellow).
5.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.

Essentially, the transformation creates a "border" of color 4 around all original objects, both on their outside edge, and internal to any holes.
