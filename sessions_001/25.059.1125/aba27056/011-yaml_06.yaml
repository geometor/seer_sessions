  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - shape: "C-like"
          color: orange
          initial_position: various
      output_objects:
        - shape: filled_rectangle
          color: yellow
          relation_to_input: "encompasses input shape and one-pixel expansion"
      transformation: "Identify a non-white shape, trace its boundary, expand the boundary when adjacent to white background, and fill the entire area with yellow."

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - shape: "cross-like"
          color: blue
          initial_position: various
      output_objects:
        - shape: filled_rectangle
          color: yellow
          relation_to_input: "encompasses entire shape"
      transformation: "Identify the non-white object, determine bounding coordinates and fill area with yellow."

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - shape: "L-like"
          color: green
          initial_position: various
      output_objects:
        - shape: "filled rectangle with one pixel border"
          color: yellow
          relation_to_input: "encompasses input and its one-pixel expansion"
      transformation: "Identify the non-white object, determine the border, expand when next to background, and fill area with yellow."

common_rules:
    selection: "Select the non-white contiguous shape."
    transformation: "Enclose the selected shape within a filled rectangle."
    fill_color: "yellow"
