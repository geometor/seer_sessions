The transformation identifies the orange (7) shape in the input grid. It then traces a border around this shape. The border includes all orange pixels, and extends one pixel outwards wherever an orange pixel is adjacent to a white (0) background pixel. Finally, it fills all pixels inside and on the border with yellow (4).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying an orange shape, tracing its border (including an outward extension where the orange shape met the white background), and filling the resulting area with yellow.

The code *mostly* works for the first example, but made a mistake with the border tracing. However, subsequent examples reveal that the transformation rule isn't universally applicable. The core issue is that the transformation rule is too specific to the first example. Other examples include different shapes, colors, starting colors, and final color.

The strategy for resolving discrepancies and refining the natural language program will involve these steps:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting the specific objects, their colors, and how they change.
2.  **Identify Common Principles:** Look for consistent rules that apply across *all* examples, not just the first one. Is there a consistent "selection" method? A consistent change?
3.  **Refine the Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect the more general rule discovered by analyzing all examples.
4. **Ensure Generality:** Ensure the description does not simply list out cases.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including observations and error analysis where applicable:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Orange "C" shape on a white background.
    *   Output: Yellow filled area encompassing the original "C" and its one-pixel expansion.
    * The original algorithm almost works, except for border expansion

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Blue "cross" shape on a white background.
    *   Output: Yellow filled rectangle, encompassing the bounds of the cross.
    * The original algorithm wouldn't even select the correct object because it look for orange.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Green "L" shape on a white background.
    *   Output: Yellow filled area, including the L and an expansion.
    * The original algorithm wouldn't even select the correct object because it look for orange.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - shape: "C-like"
          color: orange
          initial_position: various
      output_objects:
        - shape: filled_rectangle
          color: yellow
          relation_to_input: "encompasses input shape and one-pixel expansion"
      transformation: "Identify a non-white shape, trace its boundary, expand the boundary when adjacent to white background, and fill the entire area with yellow."

  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - shape: "cross-like"
          color: blue
          initial_position: various
      output_objects:
        - shape: filled_rectangle
          color: yellow
          relation_to_input: "encompasses entire shape"
      transformation: "Identify the non-white object, determine bounding coordinates and fill area with yellow."

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - shape: "L-like"
          color: green
          initial_position: various
      output_objects:
        - shape: "filled rectangle with one pixel border"
          color: yellow
          relation_to_input: "encompasses input and its one-pixel expansion"
      transformation: "Identify the non-white object, determine the border, expand when next to background, and fill area with yellow."

common_rules:
    selection: "Select the non-white contiguous shape."
    transformation: "Enclose the selected shape within a filled rectangle."
    fill_color: "yellow"
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Target Shape:** Find the single contiguous shape composed of non-white pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Trace the outermost points of the shape. The output will be a filled rectangle defined by these points, and in cases where the original shape is next to a white pixel, the boundary is extended by one pixel.

3.  **Fill with Yellow:** Create a new grid where all pixels within the calculated border, and including the border, are colored yellow.

The key improvement here is generalizing the selection criterion (any non-white shape) and the output (filled rectangle based on expansion). The expansion is the common theme across all transformations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
