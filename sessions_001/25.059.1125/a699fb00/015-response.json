The transformation seems to involve changing some of the blue (1) pixels to red (2) pixels. The positions of the red pixels in the output seem related to the positions of the blue pixels in the input. The overall grid size and shape are identical between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
