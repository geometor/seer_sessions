Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of different colors. The primary colors observed are blue (1) and white (0) in the input grids, and blue (1), red (2), and white (0) in the output grids. The transformation seems to involve changing some of the blue pixels to red based on their neighbors. The consistent elements seem to be groups of blue pixels, and transformation only impacts those.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: contain integer values representing colors

  - name: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: integer (0, 1, or 2)
      - position: (row, column)

  - name: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 1

  - name: red_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: 2

actions:
  - name: change_color
    description: Changes the color of a pixel.
    parameters:
      - target: pixel
      - new_color: integer

relationships:
   - name: adjacency
     description: two blue pixels that are horizontally adjacent

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid with a value of 1 (blue).
2.  **Check for Horizontal Adjacency:** For each blue pixel, check if it has a horizontally adjacent blue pixel (immediately to the left or right).
3.  **Transform to Red:** If a blue pixel has a horizontally adjacent blue pixel, change that blue pixel to a value of 2 (red) in the output grid, otherwise, leave them the same.
4. All non-blue pixels keep their original values.

In essence, the rule changes blue pixels to red *only* if they are part of a horizontal pair or sequence of blue pixels. Isolated blue pixels remain blue.
