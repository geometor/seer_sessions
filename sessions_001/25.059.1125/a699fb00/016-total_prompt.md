Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially with values of 0 (white) and 1 (blue). The transformation seems to involve changing some of the blue (1) pixels to red (2) pixels. The positions of the red pixels in the output seem related to the positions of the blue pixels in the input. The overall grid size and shape are identical between input and output.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 10
      cells:
        - value: 0 # White
          role: background
        - value: 1 # Blue
          role: object
        - value: 2 # Red
          role: transformed_object

actions:
  - name: transform_color
    input: blue_pixel (1)
    output: red_pixel (2)
    conditions:
       - adjacent to another blue pixel, including diagonally

relationships:
   - object1: blue_pixel
     object2: blue_pixel
     relation: adjacency (side-by-side and diagonal)
     property: affects transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:**  Locate all blue pixels (value 1) within the input grid. These are the primary objects.
2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each blue pixel, examine its eight neighbors (including diagonals).
3.  **Conditional Transformation**:If a blue pixel is adjacent to at least one other *blue* pixel, then change its value to 2.
4. **Preserve Other Pixels:** All White pixels should remain white
5.  **Output:** Produce a new grid with the transformed values, maintaining the original dimensions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
