observations:
  - object: blue_pixel
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      role: initiator
      description: Triggers the color change of adjacent white pixels.
  - object: white_pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: target
      description: Changes color to red if to the right of a blue pixel.
      constraints: Must be contiguously to the right of the blue pixel.
  - object: changed_pixel
    properties:
      color: red(2)
      role: result
      description: a white pixel that was changed.
  - action: color_change
    input:  blue_pixel, white_pixel
    output: red_pixel
    description: >-
      Changes all contiguous white pixels (0) immediately to the right of a
      blue pixel (1) to red (2). Continues until a non-white pixel or the edge of the grid is reached.
    precondition: white_pixel must be to the right of blue_pixel
    postcondition: white_pixels to the right of blue_pixel becomes red_pixel
