  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
    If a pixel is blue, determine if it is isolated by searching for other blue pixels in the eight adjacent cells.
        if a pixel is isolated, it should remain blue.
    If a pixel is blue and is connected, it should also remain blue.
    All other pixels should remain the same.
