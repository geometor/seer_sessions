The input grid's dimensions are doubled in both width and height in the output. Each pixel in the input grid is seemingly expanded into a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

All four pixels within the 2x2 block have the **same color** as the original input pixel.\n5.
