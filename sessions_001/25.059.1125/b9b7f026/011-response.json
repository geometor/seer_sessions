The input grid contains several distinct rectangular blocks of different colors (blue, green, red, and orange). Some rectangles have \"holes\" in them (the red one). The sizes of these rectangles seem to vary. The key seems to be to relate a characteristic of the colored rectangles in the image to the final output integer, and color alone seems to be a poor choice to start with.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In the supplied example, there is only object with a hole - the red rectangle.\n\nIn summary, it appears the task involves counting the number of rectangles in the input grid which contain an \"inner\" rectangle or \"hole\" of a different color.\n"
