A contiguous region is defined as a group of gray pixels connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n2.  **Select Gray Pixels for Replacement:** Within certain identified gray regions, select some gray pixels to be changed. The selection criteria will be some of the interior gray pixels.\n\n3. **Change selected Pixel color:** Change the color of the select gray pixels identified for replacement to red (2).\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the gray pixels that have been replaced with red pixels. The choice for which gray areas and which pixels within gray areas are selected will take further analysis to identify the selection process.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_regions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous regions of a specific color in the grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    regions = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col):\n        if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):\n            return []\n\n        visited[row, col] = True\n        region = [(row, col)]\n\n        # Explore adjacent cells (including diagonals)\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                region.extend(dfs(row + dr, col + dc))\n\n        return region\n\n    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[row, col] and grid[row, col] == color:\n                regions.append(dfs(row, col))\n\n    return regions\n\ndef is_interior(grid, row, col, color):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a pixel is in the interior of a region of same color pixels\"\"\"\n\n    #check that the cell is the correct color\n    if grid[row,col] != color:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check all 8 neighbors (including diagonals)\n    for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                continue  # Skip the cell itself\n            \n            #neighbor coordinates\n            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n            \n            #boundary check\n            if (nr < 0 or nr >= grid.shape[0] or nc < 0 or nc >= grid.shape[1]\n               or grid[nr,nc] != color):\n                return False #if any neighbor is not the same color, its not interior\n            \n\n    return True # All neighbors passed, so it is interior\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid by replacing some interior gray pixels with red pixels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    gray_regions = find_contiguous_regions(input_grid, 5)\n\n    # Iterate over gray pixels and check if they should be replaced\n    for region in gray_regions:\n      for row, col in region:\n          if is_interior(input_grid,row, col, 5):\n              output_grid[row,col] = 2\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
