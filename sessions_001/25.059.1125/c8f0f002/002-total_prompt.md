<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1088x464 at 0x7F4C23112250>Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of the same dimensions.
*   **Colors/Numbers:** Each cell in the grid contains a single digit (1-8), representing a specific color.
*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation seems to involve replacing some of the numbers/colors with '5' (gray). The numbers that are not 1 or 8 are changed to 5.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have identical dimensions.
  - observation: Cells contain digits from 1 to 8.
  - observation: Digit '5' (gray) appears in the output grid, replacing some digits from the input grid.
  - rule: Digits '7' are consistently replaced by '5'.
  - rule: Digits which are not '1' or '8', are replaced by '5'.
  - rule: Digits '1' and '8' remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the value of the cell:
    *   If the value is '1' or '8', keep the value unchanged in the output grid.
    *   If the value is any other digit, change this value to '5' in the output grid.
3.  **Return** the modified grid as the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
