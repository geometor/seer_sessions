Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (12x12) of pixels, primarily filled with the color white (0), into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains several non-white pixels, all of which are azure (8). These azure pixels appear to form a somewhat dispersed, cross-like shape, though not perfectly symmetrical. The output grid seems to represent a highly simplified or "abstracted" version of the input, retaining only some of the azure pixels in a diagonal pattern. The background is white.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      - [12, 12] # Input grid
      - [3, 3]   # Output grid
    elements: pixels
    colors:
      - 0  # White (background)
      - 8  # Azure

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Input grid contains azure pixels scattered, roughly forming a cross shape.
  - type: transformation
    description: Output grid is a condensed representation of the input grid.
  - type: positional
    description: Output grid seems to retain azure pixels from the input grid which lie roughly on the main diagonal, from the upper left to the bottom right corner, when scaled to the output grid dimensions.

actions:
  - type: abstraction
    description: The transformation reduces the size of the grid and the number of azure pixels.
  - type: selection
    description: Only some azure pixels from the input are retained in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid's dimensions (12x12) and the desired output grid dimensions (3x3).

2.  **Define** a scaling factor or a mapping rule from input coordinates to output coordinates. In this example, divide input grid rows and columns by 4 to get the downscaled dimensions.

3. **Iterate** through potential azure pixel locations in output grid. For a 3x3 output grid, consider, conceptually, nine large cells in the original grid, each 4x4.
4. **Check**: Within each corresponding area in the input grid, check if that area contains any azure (8) pixels.
5. **Retain diagonal**: If the area defined by scaling contains azure colored pixels, and the conceptual cell is on the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right of the output, set the equivalent output pixel at scaled location to azure (8). Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).

In essence, the program downsizes the image and keeps the azure pixels that roughly fall on a down-scaled diagonal.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
