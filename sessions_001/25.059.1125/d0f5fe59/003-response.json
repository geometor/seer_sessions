The primary color involved is azure (8), with the background being white (0). The input grid contains scattered azure shapes, while the output grid seems to represent a condensed or abstracted version of the input, focusing only on the azure pixels. The relative positions of azure are different between input and output. It seems that a diagonal sequence from the top left is important.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Starting from the top-left most azure, we pick them at increasing distances, and each successive selected azure is to the bottom-right of the last selected one. If there is no such azure to the bottom-right, stop.\n3. **Create**: Create a new, smaller 4x4 output grid.\n4. **Arrange**: Fill the output grid with the selected pixels. Place the first azure pixel found in the top-left corner (0,0) of the output. Place the next selected azure in the next diagonal position (1,1). Continue placing azures, each in the next bottom-right diagonal position, until either no more azures are found, or the bottom-right corner of the output is reached. Fill the rest of the output grid with the background color (white, 0).\n\nEssentially, the program extracts a diagonal sequence of azure pixels from the input, starting from the top-left and going down. It creates a new grid based on those selected pixels.\n"
