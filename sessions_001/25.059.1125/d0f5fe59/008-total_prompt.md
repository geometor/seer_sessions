Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focuses on extracting a diagonal of azure pixels and creating a square output grid based on the length of this diagonal. While this approach works for some cases, it clearly doesn't capture the full logic of the transformations, as evidenced by the failures in the later examples. The strategy needs to shift from simply extracting a diagonal to understanding the broader relationship between the input and output grids, potentially involving multiple object types and more complex spatial reasoning.

The core issue is that the current code is overly specific to the first example and doesn't generalize. We need to:

1.  **Identify additional object properties:** The code currently only cares about azure pixels on a diagonal. We need to consider other colors, shapes, and spatial relationships (e.g., adjacency, containment).
2.  **Re-evaluate the output grid's construction:**  The output isn't always a square grid derived from a diagonal. We must determine how the output dimensions and content are related to the input.
3. **Consider multiple transformation rules** The examples may have a combination of a few different transformations

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformations, let's gather some metrics about each input-output pair using `code_execution`. I'll focus on:

*   Dimensions of input and output grids
*   Counts of each color in input and output
*   Presence and length of azure diagonals

```python

def get_azure_diagonal(grid):
    """Finds the longest continuous diagonal of azure pixels."""
    azure_pixels = []
    max_len = 0
    for start_row in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for start_col in range(grid.shape[1]):
          if grid[start_row,start_col] == 8:
            current_len = 0
            current_row = start_row
            current_col = start_col
            temp_pixels = []
            while current_row < grid.shape[0] and current_col < grid.shape[1] and grid[current_row, current_col] == 8:
                temp_pixels.append((current_row, current_col))
                current_len += 1
                current_row += 1
                current_col += 1
            if current_len > max_len:
                max_len = current_len

    return azure_pixels

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Examine Input:** Analyze the input grid to determine its dimensions and the number of pixels of each color. Identify the longest continuous diagonal of azure pixels, noting its length and start/end positions.
2.  **Determine Output Size:**
    *   If all pixels on the input are azure, the output dimensions are the same as the input.
    *   If the longest azure diagonal has a length of 4 or more, the output grid is 4x4.
    *   If the longest azure diagonal has a length of 3, the output grid is 3x3.
    *   If the longest azure diagonal has a length of less than 3, the output grid is 2x2.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid filled with zeros, with the size determined in the previous step.
4.  **Populate Diagonal (with variations):**
    *   If all pixels on input are azure, keep all the pixels.
    *    If the longest azure diagonal length is greater or equal to 3, fill the main diagonal of the output grid with azure pixels, up to a maximum of 4 azure pixels.
    *   If the longest azure diagonal length is less than 3, fill a 2x2 diagonal with azure pixels.

This revised natural language program accounts for the observed variations in output size and the conditional logic based on the azure diagonal length. It also introduces the case where if the input grid is all azure, the ouput is the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
