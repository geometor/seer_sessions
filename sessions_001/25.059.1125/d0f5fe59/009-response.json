The input grid contains several non-white pixels, all of which are azure (8). These azure pixels appear to form a somewhat dispersed, cross-like shape, though not perfectly symmetrical. The output grid seems to represent a highly simplified or \"abstracted\" version of the input, retaining only some of the azure pixels in a diagonal pattern. The background is white.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this example, divide input grid rows and columns by 4 to get the downscaled dimensions.\n\n3. **Iterate** through potential azure pixel locations in output grid. For a 3x3 output grid, consider, conceptually, nine large cells in the original grid, each 4x4.\n4. **Check**: Within each corresponding area in the input grid, check if that area contains any azure (8) pixels.\n5. **Retain diagonal**: If the area defined by scaling contains azure colored pixels, and the conceptual cell is on the main diagonal from top-left to bottom-right of the output, set the equivalent output pixel at scaled location to azure (8). Otherwise, the output pixel is white (0).\n\nIn essence, the program downsizes the image and keeps the azure pixels that roughly fall on a down-scaled diagonal.\n"
