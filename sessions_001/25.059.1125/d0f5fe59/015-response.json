The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8) and white (0). The input grid contains several azure-colored shapes, while the output grid appears to represent a highly simplified version, possibly capturing the essence of the shapes' relative positions. It seems like a process of extreme reduction and abstraction, focusing on top-left and bottom-right corners of bounding boxes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Place the color of the top-left pixel of the *first* identified shape's bounding box in the top-left cell of the output grid. Place the color value of the bottom-right pixel of the *last* identified shape's bounding box in the bottom-right cell of the output grid. Fill the remaining two cells of the output grid with white (0). If only one shape detected, the top-left pixel goes to output top-left, and bottom right of the same shape goes to the output bottom-right.\n\nThe core concept is to reduce the input grid to a 2x2 representation by identifying the bounding boxes of azure shapes and extracting key corner pixels to represent their spatial relationship in a highly abstracted form.\n"
