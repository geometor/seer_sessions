            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, incorporating the results from all training examples:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focused on extracting a diagonal sequence of azure pixels. This approach worked for the first training example but failed to generalize to the other examples. The core issue is that the transformation isn't *always* about a diagonal of azure. The size of the output and the specific arrangement of azure pixels varies across examples. The initial assumption that the output is always 4x4 and contains only azure pixels arranged diagonally is incorrect. The actual size of the output must be determined based on the characteristics of the input and the rule must account for when the output has less than 4 azure.\n\nThe strategy needs to shift from a fixed diagonal extraction to a more flexible approach that analyzes the *relationship* between azure pixels in the input and how they might map to the output. It appears the output size may correspond to how many unique values along the diagonal could be found or other object attributes.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution Simulation):**\n\nSince I can't directly execute code, I'll simulate the execution and provide the expected observations.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Azure Pixels: `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4,4) ... (9,9)]`\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Observed Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Correct Pixels: All (assuming diagonal azure placement)\n    *   Incorrect Pixels: None (based on initial, flawed assumption)\n    *   Notes: Initial hypothesis works.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (10, 10)\n    *   Azure Pixels: `[(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]`\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Observed Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Correct Pixels: `[(0,0), (1,1), (2,2)] = 8`.\n    *   Incorrect Pixels: `(3,3) = 0` should not exist and others might be wrong size\n    *   Notes: Output shape mismatch. The 4x4 assumption is wrong.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (7, 7)\n    *   Azure Pixels: `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)]`\n    *   Expected Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Observed Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Correct Pixels: `[(0, 0), (1,1)]=8`\n    *   Incorrect Pixels: `[(2,2), (3,3)] = 8`.\n    *   Notes: Output shape mismatch. Only two azure pixels should be in the output.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"Extract a subset of azure pixels\"\n  - objects:\n      - name: input_grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - contains_colors: [0-9]\n          - azure_pixels: \"Coordinates of pixels with value 8\"\n      - name: output_grid\n        type: 2D array\n        properties:\n          - contains_colors: [8]\n          - size: \"Determined by a rule related to input_grid azure pixels\"\n          - pixel_arrangement: \"Diagonal, starting from top-left\"\n  - actions:\n      - description: \"Identify azure pixels in input_grid.\"\n      - description: \"Determine the size of output_grid based on input_grid.\"\n      - description: \"Populate output_grid with azure pixels, possibly a subset of those from input_grid.\"\n      - description: \"The size of the diagonal azure in the output is based on a subset rule.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with a value of 8 (azure) within the input grid.\n2.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid's dimensions are determined by a rule that identifies the longest possible diagonal of azure and determines the number of pixels to include based on that. The rule accounts for cases with 4 or less azure pixels.\n3.  **Populate Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the determined size. Fill the output grid with azure pixels. The output's main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) should be populated with azure pixels, selecting a subset of the azure pixels found in the input grid if they exceed the output's size or if the input azure pixels are not along a continuous diagonal.\n\nThe key change here is recognizing that the output size and the number of azure pixels placed on the diagonal is dynamic and determined by logic related to the count of pixels in an azure diagonal, not just the presence of azure. The details of the \"subset rule\" must be refined.\n"
