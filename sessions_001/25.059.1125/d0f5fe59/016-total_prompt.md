Okay, here's a report on my perception of the task, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a much smaller grid (output). The primary colors involved seem to be azure (8) and white (0). The input grid contains several azure-colored shapes, while the output grid appears to represent a highly simplified version, possibly capturing the essence of the shapes' relative positions. It seems like a process of extreme reduction and abstraction, focusing on top-left and bottom-right corners of bounding boxes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 8]
      - dimensions: [8, 12]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 8]
      - dimensions: [2, 2]
  - name: azure_shapes
    type: connected_components
    properties:
      - color: 8
      - shape: irregular
      - count: variable # Could be more than one in other examples
    relations: []
  - name: bounding_box
    type: rectangle
    properties:
       - color: null # conceptual
       - surrounds: azure_shapes

actions:
  - type: find_bounding_boxes
    agent: system
    target: azure_shapes
  - type: extract_corners
    agent: system
    target: bounding_boxes
    properties: [top_left, bottom_right]
  - type: construct_output
    agent: system
    target: output_grid
    parameters: [extracted_corners]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Azure Shapes:** Find all connected regions of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2. **Bounding Boxes:** For each identified azure shape, determine the minimum bounding box that completely encloses it.
3. **Extract Corners:** From each bounding box, extract the color value of the top-left pixel and the bottom-right pixel.
4. **Construct Output:** Create a 2x2 output grid. Place the color of the top-left pixel of the *first* identified shape's bounding box in the top-left cell of the output grid. Place the color value of the bottom-right pixel of the *last* identified shape's bounding box in the bottom-right cell of the output grid. Fill the remaining two cells of the output grid with white (0). If only one shape detected, the top-left pixel goes to output top-left, and bottom right of the same shape goes to the output bottom-right.

The core concept is to reduce the input grid to a 2x2 representation by identifying the bounding boxes of azure shapes and extracting key corner pixels to represent their spatial relationship in a highly abstracted form.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
