**input:**
```

0 5 0 0 0
8 8 5 0 0
0 2 0 5 0
0 2 0 1 5

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7F4C1B6BF650>

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (5x5 in this example). There's a noticeable shift and potential combination of certain colored pixels, while others seem to disappear or remain unchanged. The primary colors involved appear to be gray (5), azure (8), red (2), and blue (1), with white (0) acting as a background.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    input_elements:
      - color: gray (5)
        positions: [(0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)]
      - color: azure (8)
        positions: [(2,0), (2,1)]
      - color: red (2)
        positions: [(3,1), (4,1)]
      - color: blue (1)
        positions: [(4,3)]
      - color: white (0)
        positions: "all other cells"
    output_elements:
      - color: gray (5)
        positions: [(0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)]
      - color: azure (8)
        positions: [(0,2), (1,2)]
      - color: red (2)
        positions: [(1,3), (1,4)]
      - color: blue (1)
        positions: [(3,4)]
      - color: white (0)
        positions: "all other cells"
    transformations:
      - object: azure (8)
        action: shift right
        amount: 2 columns
      - object: red (2)
        action: shift right and up, maintain relative position
        amount: up 2 rows, to row 1
      - object: blue(1)
         action: maintain 5 position
         amount: row, col - 1

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all pixels with colors other than white (0). These are our objects.
2.  **Gray (5) Diagonal:** The gray (5) pixels along the main diagonal remain in the same positions.
3. **Azure (8) Shift:** The azure (8) pixels shift two columns to the right.
4.  **Red (2) Shift:** The red (2) pixels shift up two rows, to row 1.
5. **Blue (1) Shift:** Find the blue (1) pixel and put gray(5) in its original row and col, and place the blue (1) in gray(5)'s place.
6.  **Background:** All other cells remain white (0).

In essence, the transformation involves specific horizontal and vertical shifts of colored pixels, while maintaining the positions of the gray diagonal and implicitly treating white as the background. The red pixels keep relative position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
