**input:**
```
5 0 0
3 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7F4C1B6BF650>

**output:**
```
5 3 0
0 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7F4C1B700550>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors present are gray (5), white (0), and green (3). The positions of these colored pixels change from the input grid to the output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: object
    description: colored pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [gray, white, green]
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: transformation
    description: movement of colored pixels
    details: "Pixels of color 3 and 5 change their position. Others do not"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the pixels with the values 3 (green) and 5 (gray).
2.  **Swap:** Move the value 3 (green) to the place occupied by 5 (gray) in the first row. Copy other values from input to output.

Essentially, the transformation involves reordering of the first row, moving the value 3 one step to the right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
