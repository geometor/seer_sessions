Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation involves specific horizontal and vertical shifts of colored pixels, while maintaining the positions of the gray diagonal and implicitly treating white as the background. The red pixels keep relative position.

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all pixels with colors other than white (0). These are our objects.
2.  **Gray (5) Diagonal:** The gray (5) pixels along the main diagonal remain in the same positions.
3. **Azure (8) Shift:** The azure (8) pixels shift two columns to the right.
4.  **Red (2) Shift:** The red (2) pixels shift up two rows, to row 1.
5. **Blue (1) Shift:** Find the blue (1) pixel and put gray(5) in its original row and col, and place the blue (1) in gray(5)'s place.
6.  **Background:** All other cells remain white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
