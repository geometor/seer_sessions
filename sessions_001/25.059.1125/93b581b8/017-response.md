Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved mirroring a central 2x2 block's elements to the corners. This approach works for the first example but fails on others because the dimensions of the input grid and subsequently the output grid are dynamic. The mirroring locations is always relative to the central 2x2 core, but the receiving location is indexed relative to the overall dimensions. The initial code has the receiving locations hard coded for a 6x6 grid.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Dynamic Output Dimensions:** Instead of hardcoding the corner indices (0:2, 4:6), we need to calculate them dynamically based on the input grid's dimensions.
2.  **Confirm Core Logic:** Re-verify the core mirroring logic (bottom-right to top-left, etc.) to ensure it's consistent across all examples. It appears correct, but double-checking is crucial.
3. **Example Specific Analysis:** Examine if the error on the second and third example suggests a consistent pattern.

**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution):**

To be precise, I would typically run the provided `transform` function on each input and compare it pixel-by-pixel with the expected output, and also obtain the shape of the input grids. Since I can't execute code directly, I am simulating the results.

*Example 1:*

*   Input Shape: (6, 6)
*   Output Shape: (6, 6)
*   Result: Success (assumed, as the code was designed for this)

*Example 2:*

*   Input Shape: (5, 5)
*   Output Shape: (5, 5)
*   Result: Fail.
    - The core 2x2 is correctly placed
    - The errors are on the corners, values are present that should be white
    - shape = (5,5)
    - 0:2, 4:6, on a 5x5 grid is a problem.

*Example 3:*

*   Input Shape: (7, 7)
*   Output Shape: (7, 7)
*   Result: Fail.
    - The core 2x2 is correctly placed
    - The errors are on the corners, missing the mirroring.
    - shape = (7,7)
    - 0:2, 4:6 on a 7x7 grid leaves row and column index 6 white.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: mirror_core_to_corners
observations:
  - object: core
    type: 2x2 block
    location: center of input grid
    properties:
      - contains_non_zero_pixels: true
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: same as input_grid
      - content: initially all zeros (white)
  - action: copy
    source: core
    destination: core location in output_grid
  - action: mirror
    source: core bottom-right pixel
    destination: output_grid top-left corner
  - action: mirror
    source: core bottom-left pixel
    destination: output_grid top-right corner
  - action: mirror
    source: core top-right pixel
    destination: output_grid bottom-left corner
  - action: mirror
    source: core top-left pixel
    destination: output_grid bottom-right corner

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the center of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve the Core**: Copy the 2x2 core block from the input to the identical location of the output grid
3.  **Mirror Top-Left:** Copy the value in the bottom right of the 2x2 core to the top-left 2x2 corner of the output grid.
4.  **Mirror Top-Right:** Copy the value in the bottom left of the 2x2 core to the top-right 2x2 corner of the output grid.
5.  **Mirror Bottom-Left:** Copy the value at the top right of the 2x2 core to the bottom-left 2x2 corner of the output grid.
6.  **Mirror Bottom-Right:** Copy the value in the top left of the 2x2 core to the bottom-right 2x2 corner of the output grid.
7. **Fill Remaining:** Keep all other cells in the output grid as 0 (white).
8. **Dynamic Corner Indexing:**
     - Top-left corner starts at row 0, column 0.
     - Top-right corner starts at row 0, column (width - 2).
     - Bottom-left corner starts at row (height - 2), column 0.
     - Bottom-right corner starts at row (height - 2), column (width - 2).
     - all corners extend 2x2

The critical addition is step 8, which explicitly describes how to calculate the corner positions based on the input grid's dimensions. This ensures the mirroring happens correctly regardless of the grid size.
