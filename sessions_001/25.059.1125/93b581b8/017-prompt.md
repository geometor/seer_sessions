Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 2x2 block of non-zero pixels in the center of the input grid (rows 3-4, columns 3-4).
2.  **Preserve the Core**: Copy the 2x2 core block from the input to the identical location of the output grid
3.  **Mirror Top-Left:** Identify the colors represented by the value in the bottom right of the 2x2 core. Mirror these values to the top-left 2x2 corner of the output grid.
4.  **Mirror Top-Right:** Identify the colors represented by the value in the bottom left of the 2x2 core. Mirror these values to the top-right 2x2 corner of the output grid.
5.  **Mirror Bottom-Left:** Identify the colors represented by the values at the top right of the 2x2 core. Mirror these values to the bottom-left 2x2 corner of the output grid.
6.  **Mirror Bottom-Right:** Identify the colors represented by the values in the top left of the 2x2 core. Mirror these values to the bottom-right 2x2 corner of the output grid.
7. **Fill Remaining:** Keep all other cells in the output grid as 0 (white).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
