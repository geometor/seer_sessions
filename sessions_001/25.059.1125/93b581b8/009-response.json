The input grid contains a 2x2 block of non-zero colored pixels, while the rest of the grid is filled with zeros (white). The output grid appears to modify the input in two ways, reflecting part, and moving part.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Place this mirrored two-color block in the output grid starting two rows below the original block's lower edge. Copy the block again into the next row.\n\nIn summary, there are three key actions: The top row has a partial reflection of certain single pixels, the middle 2x2 area isn't altered, and a mirrored copy and translation of the top row of colored pixels appears below.\n"
