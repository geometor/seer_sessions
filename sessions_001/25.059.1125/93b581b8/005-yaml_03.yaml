description: Identify a 2x2 block of non-zero colored pixels, and create mirrored 2x2 blocks in the corners of the grid.
objects:
  - id: block_2x2
    type: rectangle
    dimensions: 2x2
    properties:
      colors: varied (determined by input)
      location: variable (identified in input)
  - id: corner_blocks
    type: rectangle
    dimensions: 2x2
    properties:
      colors: derived (from block_2x2)
      location: corners of the grid
actions:
  - find:
      object: block_2x2
      method: iterate through grid, checking 2x2 subgrids
  - create:
      object: corner_blocks
      properties:
        colors: derived from corresponding corners of block_2x2 (TL->BR, TR->BL, BL->TR, BR->TL)
        location: four corners of the output grid
  - copy_input:
      condition: if block_2x2 is not identified
