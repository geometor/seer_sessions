objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - type: region
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      shape: contiguous block
      position:
        method: centroid  # Use centroid for region position
        x: float        # Average column index
        y: float        # Average row index
    actions:
      - transform:
          condition: relative position of centroid
          change: specific region parts change to orange(7), azure(8) or magenta(6)

transformations:
  - condition: "top-left gray region (determined by centroid)"
    action: "change part of region closest to the center of the grid to orange (7)"
  - condition: "center-right gray region (determined by centroid)"
    action: "change part of region closest to the center of the grid to azure (8)"
  - condition: "bottom-left gray region (determined by centroid)"
    action: "change a single pixel of region, closest to the center of the grid to magenta (6)"
