The primary color in the input is gray (5), with some white (0). The output introduces new colors within the gray areas. There are two distinct gray regions in each input, and each gets filled with a different, unique 2x2 block of a new color. The shapes and sizes of these distinct regions seem to vary in each train example. The key seems to be identifying the contiguous gray regions and replacing sub-regions within them with new colors. The white regions are unchanged in all examples.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
