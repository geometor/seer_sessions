<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2432x1616 at 0x7F4C231100D0>Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids with single-digit integer values, which represent colors.  The primary color in the input is gray (5), with some white (0). The output introduces new colors within the gray areas. There are two distinct gray regions in each input, and each gets filled with a different, unique 2x2 block of a new color. The shapes and sizes of these distinct regions seem to vary in each train example. The key seems to be identifying the contiguous gray regions and replacing sub-regions within them with new colors. The white regions are unchanged in all examples.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - colors: [white, gray, azure, orange, magenta]
  - name: gray_region
    type: contiguous_area
    properties:
      - color: gray (5)
      - shape: variable
  - name: fill_region
    type: contiguous_area
    properties:
      - size: 2x2
      - colors: [azure (8), orange (7), magenta (6)]

actions:
  - name: identify_gray_regions
    description: Find all contiguous areas of gray pixels.
  - name: replace_subregion
    description: Replace a 2x2 sub-region within each gray region with a new color.
  - name: select_color
    description: Choose a distinct color for each 2x2 subregion from a limited set of available colors.
relationships:
  - gray_regions_contain: fill_regions
  - fill_region_color: unique_per_gray_region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Gray Regions:** Find all distinct contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2. **Iterate through Regions:** For each identified gray region:
3. **Select Color:** Choose a unique color (not gray or white) for this region. For this specific task set the available colors are azure(8), orange(7), and magenta(6).
4. **Find and Fill Sub-region:** locate a 2x2 square area inside the gray region.
5. **Replace:** replace those pixels in this square area by new color that was selected for this gray region
6. **Preserve other colors:** any pixels that aren't within one of the identified squares should be unchanged.

The program identifies all of the disconnected regions of grey, and replaces the a 2x2 area inside with another solid color. each region has different color. the selection criteria for which 2x2 region to replace, and the color used for replacement appears arbitrary, but is consistent across each distinct example, suggesting that it could be predicted.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
