The primary change seems to occur within specific regions of the input grid defined by the color gray (value 5). Inside the gray area, some pixels seem to be replaced based on patterns of 5's.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Locate the three horizontally adjacent, inner most gray pixels and replace them with azure (8).\n    b. Find one inner most gray pixel surrounded on top, right and left by 5s, and replace with magenta (6)\n4. **Conditional Replacement (Bottom region):** Locate a 2 x 2 group of inner most gray pixels, and replace with orange (7).\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not gray, or a targeted inner gray, remain unchanged.\n\nEssentially the regions of interest seem to follow a pattern of replacing the inner most 5's with other colors in distinct shapes.\n"
