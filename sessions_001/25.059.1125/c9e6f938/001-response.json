The primary color observed is '0' (white) and '7' (orange). The transformation seems to involve expanding the orange (7) regions horizontally, sometimes with a mirroring effect. The dimensions of the grid also change.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

An orange region is defined as one or more adjacent cells with the value '7'.\n\n2.  **Determine the expansion factor**: Observe how the orange regions from the input map onto the output.\n    *   In example 1, a single '7' expands to two '7's, two '7' adjacent expands to four '7's\n    *   In example 2, two '7's expand into four '7's\n    *   In example 3, a single '7' expands into two, mirrored.\n\n3. **Expand**:\n    *   If there exists at least one '7':\n        1.  Double each sequence of adjacent '7's horizontally.\n\n4.  **Mirror**\n    *   If, after doubling, there are no adjacent '7's, fill the available locations with a mirrored set.\n\n5. **Adjust the Grid:**\n    1. The final width is double the original if there were no adjacent 7s in input and input.width + number\\_of\\_7s - 1\n    2. The final height is same as the input.\n    3. Insert 0 to fill the added space if any.\n\nIn summary, the transformation duplicates the orange regions horizontally, and in case where 7s were single they are mirror in addition to being doubled. The grid's width doubles or expands in size according the expansion of 7s, and it will be filled with 0.\n"
