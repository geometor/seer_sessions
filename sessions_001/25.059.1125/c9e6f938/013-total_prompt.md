"""
1.  **Check Input Dimensions:** If and only if the input grid has a width of 3, create a new output grid with double the width. Otherwise, keep the input dimensions.
2.  **Copy Unchanged Pixels:** Copy all pixels from the input grid to the same position in the output grid.
3.  **Identify Orange Blocks:** Find all contiguous horizontal blocks of orange (7) pixels in the input grid.
4.  **Duplicate Orange Blocks:** For each contiguous block of orange pixels, extend it to the right within the output grid by a length equal to the original block's length.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
