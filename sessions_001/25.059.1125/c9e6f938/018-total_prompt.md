"""
1.  **Identify the orange pixel:** Locate the pixel with a value of 7 (orange) in the input grid.
2.  **Double the grid width:** Create a new grid with the same height as the original, but twice the width.
3. **Copy the orange:** In the same row where the orange pixel was original, in the new grid, set the corresponding column in the new grid to be 7.
4.  **Mirror the orange pixel:** In the expanded grid, place another orange pixel (7) at the opposite end of the row containing the original orange pixel. Specifically, if the original orange pixel is at `(row, col)`, the new orange pixel will be at `(row, new_width - 1 - col)`.
5.  **Fill remaining cells:** All other cells in the output grid remain white (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, and as expected, it doesn't generalize perfectly to all cases. The core concept of identifying the orange pixel and mirroring it is correct, but the specifics of *where* the mirrored pixel is placed need adjustment. The initial assumption of doubling the grid width and placing the mirror at the exact opposite end is too rigid.  The key is to understand the relationship between the original orange pixel's position and its mirrored counterpart *relative to the original grid's boundaries*, not just a simple width doubling. The strategy is:

1.  **Examine All Examples:**  Carefully analyze each input/output pair in the training set to identify the precise mirroring logic.
2.  **Code Execution for Metrics:** Use code execution to precisely determine the coordinates of the orange pixels in both the input and output grids for each example. This will provide concrete data for pattern detection.
3.  **Refine the Relationship:**  Instead of assuming a fixed width doubling, determine the *offset* or distance the mirrored pixel is placed from the *right edge* of the original grid. This offset should be related to the original orange pixel's column position.
4. **YAML and NL Program Update**: Update facts in the YAML, then revise the natural language program to reflect the generalized mirroring rule based on the identified relationship, which can accommodate different widths.

**Code Execution for Metrics**

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate Orange Pixel:** Find the coordinates (row, column) of the orange pixel (value 7) within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Extension Amount:** Calculate the amount the grid will be extended. This equals `input_width - 1 - original_column`.
3.  **Create Extended Grid:** Create a new output grid. Its height matches the row of the orange pixel (or is adjusted as needed to include the mirrored position if the mirror is on row 0 of output).  Its width is equal to `input_width + (2 * extension_amount)`. This is equivalent to doubling the width, as observed.
4.  **Copy Original Orange Pixel:**  Place an orange pixel (7) in the output grid at the same position as in the input grid.
5. **Mirror Orange Pixel:** Place an orange pixel at the original row number and a column number calculated by adding the extension amount to the `input_width - 1`. This ensures the correct mirrored position relative to the original grid's boundaries. In the cases where there isn't a row 0, then the mirrored pixel will be placed in row 0.
6.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** All other cells in the output grid are filled with white (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
