The input grid has a distinct pattern: an outer border of green (3), an inner square of red (2), and a central square of white (0). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, where the white (0) pixels in the center are removed, and their place is taken by surrounding colors in a layered approach. The colors are shifted inwards.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
