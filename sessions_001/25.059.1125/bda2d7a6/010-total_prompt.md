Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 6x6 grids. The input grid contains a central block of orange (7) and magenta (6) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid appears to be an "inversion" of the input.  The central block is transformed, and the surrounding white pixels are replaced with magenta (6). It seems like a color swap or fill operation based on the initial configuration. The inner 2x2 magenta square becomes orange, while the surrounding orange rectangle becomes white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
  - name: central_block
    type: rectangle
    input_location:  rows 2-5, cols 2-5 (inclusive)
    input_colors: [7, 6]
    output_location: rows 2-5, cols 2-5 (inclusive)
    output_colors: [0,7]
  - name: outer_block
      type: frame
      input_location: rows 1,6 and cols 1,6
      input_color: [0]
      output_location: rows 1,6 and cols 1,6
      output_color: [6]

actions:
  - type: color_swap
    description: Colors of the central block are inverted relative to each other.
  - type: fill
    description: Outer area is filled with color 6.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The 'central_block' is surrounded by the 'outer_block'
  - type: inverse_color_central
    description: input central colors [6,7] are output as [7,0]
  - type: inverse_color_outer
    description: outside border is inverted [0 -> 6]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the central block:**  Locate the contiguous 4x4 block within the input grid, rows 2-5 and cols 2-5.
2. **Identify the inner block:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block within the input grid, rows 3-4 and cols 3-4.
3.  **Invert Central Block Colors:** Within the 4x4 central block identified in step 1:
    *   Change all orange (7) pixels to white (0).
    *   Change all magenta (6) pixels to orange (7).
4.  **Fill Surrounding Area:** Change all white (0) pixels in the *rest* of the grid (the area *outside* of the 4x4 central block) to magenta (6).
5. The output should be a grid with an outer area of magenta, a 2x2 square of orange, and the balance of the central 4x4 block white.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
