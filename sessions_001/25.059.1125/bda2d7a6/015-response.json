The primary colors involved are azure (8), gray (5), and white (0). The input and output grids are of the same dimensions (8x8). The transformation appears to involve a color swap and maintain the overall structure and shape of the objects. The outside edge swap, and an inner cross shaped object exists in the original that swaps as well.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
