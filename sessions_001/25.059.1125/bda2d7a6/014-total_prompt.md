1.  **Identify the central 4x4 block:** Locate the contiguous 4x4 block within the input grid, defined by rows 2-5 (inclusive) and columns 2-5 (inclusive).
2.  **Color Inversion within Central Block:** Within this 4x4 central block:
    *   Change all orange (7) pixels to white (0).
    *   Change all magenta (6) pixels to orange (7).
3.  **Fill Surrounding Area:** Change all white (0) pixels in the region *outside* the 4x4 central block to magenta (6).
4. **Identify inner 2x2 block:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block within the input grid, defined by rows 3-4 (inclusive) and columns 3-4 (inclusive). Note the colors are already correct in this area, so no operation is necessary.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation rule to the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial rule, based on the first example, correctly identifies the central 4x4 block and the color inversions within it. It also correctly identifies the need to fill the surrounding area with magenta. However, example 2 seems to highlight edge cases, demonstrating that the boundaries might be based on the orange border.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Initial Observations**: Re-examine the first training example to confirm the accuracy of object identification.
2.  **Analyze Example 2**: Use the second training example and it's results. Determine where the error occurs.
3.  **Boundary Detection**: Develop a more robust understanding of the boundary definition. it may not be a fixed 4x4, instead relative to the object positions.
4.  **Refine Natural Language Program**: Update the natural language program based on the new findings, making it general enough to apply to all examples.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution):**

To better understand the examples and the discrepancies, let's use code execution to gather some metrics. This will focus on the size and pixel counts of the input and the difference between the output grid and prediction.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, predicted_output):
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    input_orange_count = np.sum(input_grid == 7)
    input_magenta_count = np.sum(input_grid == 6)
    input_white_count = np.sum(input_grid==0)

    diff = expected_output - predicted_output
    diff_count = np.sum(diff != 0)
    

    print(f"  Input Shape: {input_shape}")
    print(f"  Input Orange Count: {input_orange_count}")
    print(f"  Input Magenta Count: {input_magenta_count}")
    print(f"  Input White Count: {input_white_count}")
    print(f"  Difference (pixels): {diff_count}")
    print(f"  Difference array:\n{diff}\n")

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Identify the Outer Orange Rectangle:** Find the bounding box of the largest contiguous block of orange pixels. This defines the "outer orange rectangle."
2.  **Identify Inner Magenta Rectangle:** Find the bounding box of the contiguous block of magenta pixels inside the outer orange rectangle.
3. **Color Transformations:**
      *   All pixels *outside* the "outer orange rectangle" that are white become magenta.
      *   Within the "outer orange rectangle", all orange pixels become white.
      *   Within the "outer orange rectangle", all magenta pixels become orange.

This revised program accounts for the dynamic size of the central block. The previous version incorrectly assumed this block would have a fixed size and position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
