Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code captured the basic idea of identifying layers, removing the center, shifting inwards, and blanking the perimeter. However, the results across all three training examples show inconsistencies, particularly in how the "shifting inwards" part is handled and how the perimeter blanking affects other colored areas. The code correctly handles some aspects, like, but it has a bug that generates extra empty lines.

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Precise Layer Identification:** Refine the method of identifying colored layers to account for variations in their shapes and positions. The current implementation assumes consistent layering which is not universally true across all examples.
2.  **Conditional Shifting:** Improve the "shifting inwards" logic to correctly determine which color should fill the void left by the removed center, depending on surrounding area
3.  **Refined Perimeter Blanking:** Ensure that blanking the perimeter does not inadvertently affect other colors, preserving the intended transformation.
4. **Fix Shifting:** Currently, the program does not shift. It only fills the center by the first color encountered in a surrounding layer.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand each case, let's organize the observations and the differences between the expected output and the actual output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Green border, red inner square, white center.
    *   Expected Output: White border, red center.
    *   Actual Output: White border, red center.
    * observation: correct

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Orange border, green inner square, white center.
    *   Expected Output: White border, green center.
    *   Actual Output: White border, green center.
    * observation: correct

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Yellow border, magenta inner square, white center.
    *   Expected output: White border, magenta center.
    *   Actual output: White border, magenta center.
    * observation: correct

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input grids consistently have a colored outer border, a different colored inner region, and a white center."
  - object: "Outer border"
    properties: "Encloses the entire grid, color varies (green, orange, yellow)."
  - object: "Inner region"
    properties: "Lies within the outer border, color varies (red, green, magenta), forms a square adjacent to the white center."
  - object: "Center"
    properties: "A white square at the core of the grid."
  - action: "Remove center"
    description: "The white center square is removed."
  - action: "Shift inwards"
    description: "The color of the inner region expands to fill the space previously occupied by the white center."
  - action: "Blank perimeter"
    description: "The outermost border of the grid is set to white."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Layers:** Observe and distinguish the different colored regions in the input grid. These typically include an outer border (color varies), an inner region (color varies), and a central white square.
2.  **Remove Center:** Eliminate the central white square (color 0).
3.  **Shift Inwards:** Expand the inner region's color to fill the area previously occupied by the central white square.
4.  **Blank Perimeter:** Set all pixels on the grid's outermost border to white (color 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
