**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** The input and output are both grids of the same dimensions.
*   **Colors:** Each number represents a distinct color. The transformation involves changing colors within the grid.
*   **Shapes:** The input grids seem to contain a central "square" shape of one color, surrounded by another color, and finally enclosed by a border of a third color.  It looks like these inner shapes are swapped.
*    **Inversion:** The output shows that inside and outside colors get swapped, excluding the outermost border.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: color_swap_nested_square
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: square (rows == cols)
      - border:
        color: varies (outermost layer)
      - inner_square_1:
          color: C1, inside boarder
      - inner_square_2:
          color: C2, center
      - color_map: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
actions:
  - name: swap_colors
    description: Invert colors of the two inner squares, leaving the outermost border unchanged.
relationships:
  - type: nested_squares
    description: The grid contains two inner squares of different colors, surrounded by a consistent border.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the outermost border:** Find the color of the pixels on the perimeter of the input grid. This border color remains unchanged in the output.

2.  **Identify Inner Colors**: find two additional colors, one inside the border, and the other nested inside the previous.

3. **Swap**: swap the colors of the two inner squares.

4.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct the output grid by:
    *   Copying the outermost border color from the input grid.
    *   Filling the area inside that border with the identified color for each square.
    * leaving the outermost border from the original input.

In short, the transformation swaps the colors of the inner squares, nested within each other, while preserving the outermost border color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
