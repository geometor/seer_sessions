There is a single change. The pixel at input grid (4,3) is 1(blue), in output grid (4,3) is 3(green).\n5.  **Transform:** Change the second green pixel to the position between existing green objects.\n\nIn summary, the transformation involves identifying green pixels and the blue pixel between them. The input has two green pixels, the program will make a new green pixel to be between the original green pixels, at the same row.\n"
