The primary colors I see are blue (1), white (0), orange (7), and green (3). The input and output grids are mostly identical, with subtle changes in the placement of the green (3) and orange (7) pixels, specifically along the columns containing those non-blue/white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this example, these are columns 1 and 3 (using 0-based indexing).\n2. **Vertical Pixel Shifting:** For each identified column:\n    -   Within column 1, Locate Green, it has moved down one position\n    -   Within column 3, it doesn't look like 7 has moved, so check 3, and we can see that 3 has moved down by 1\n3. **Preservation:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged. In other words, only shift a pixel by one position down in any columns that contain 3 or 7.\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule involves selectively shifting green and possibly orange pixels down *one* position vertically within their respective columns, while leaving all other pixels unaltered.\n"
