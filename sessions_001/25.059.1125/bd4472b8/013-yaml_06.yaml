facts:
  - observation: "The output always begins with a row of black pixels (color 0)."
  - observation: "The second row of the output contains a horizontal section of repeating colors from the input."
  - observation: "The remaining rows of the output consist of duplications of a detected pattern in the input."
  - observation: "Input example 1 has a 3x1 repeating color block (8, 8, 8) in the second row."
  - observation: "Input example 2 has a 3x1 repeating color block (6, 6, 6) in the first row."
  - observation: "Input example 3 has a 2x2 repeating color block (3, 3) in the first and second rows."
  - observation: "The repeating block in the input is copied and becomes the repeating unit of the output."
  - observation: "The width of output appears to match the width of input."
