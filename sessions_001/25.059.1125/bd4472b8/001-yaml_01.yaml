facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - top_row: colors (non-zero integers)
      - second_row: all 5s
      - remaining_rows: all 0s
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: same as input_grid
      - height: calculated based on input
      - first_two_rows: same as input_grid
      - subsequent_rows: repetition of top_row colors, creating vertical stripes.
  - action: replicate_colors
    description: The colors from the top row of the input grid are repeated vertically downwards in the output grid.
  - relationship: width_consistency
    description: Input and output grids have the same width.
  - relationship: height_relation:
    description: output grid height depends on repeating the top row until output is created.
