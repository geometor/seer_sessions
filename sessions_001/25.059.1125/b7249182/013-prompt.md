Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Key Pixels:** Find the coordinates of the single green (3) pixel and the single blue (1) pixel within the input grid.

2.  **Horizontal Fill:**
    *   Create a horizontal sequence of pixels in a single row of the output grid.
    *   Starting from the green pixel's column and extending left to the edge of the grid, fill with green (3).
    *   Starting from the blue pixel's column and extending right to the edge of the grid, fill with blue (1).
    *   Fill the space between the green and the blue with green to the left of the mid point and blue to the right.

3.  **Vertical Fill:**
    *   Fill all rows of the output grid with the horizontal sequence generated.

4. **Preserve:**
   * The output grid will have the same dimensions as the input grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
