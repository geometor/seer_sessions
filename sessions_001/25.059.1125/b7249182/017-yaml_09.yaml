observations:
  context:
    - The task involves transforming a grid of pixels.
    - Non-zero pixels are significant and trigger a transformation.
    - The transformation involves creating a new shape.
    - Zero-valued pixels remain unchanged, unless overlapped by a shape.

  objects:
    - input_grid: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.
    - output_grid: A 2D array of integers, initially all zeros, representing the transformed result.
    - non_zero_pixels: Individual pixels within the input_grid with values other than 0.
    - cross: A shape formed by horizontal and vertical lines intersecting at a center point.
    - center: The original location of a non-zero pixel.
    - horizontal_line: part of cross
    - vertical_line: part of cross

  properties:
    - pixel_value: An integer (0-9) representing the color of a pixel.
    - center_coordinates: A tuple (row, col) representing the location of a non-zero pixel.
    - cross_color: The same as the `pixel_value` of the non-zero pixel that triggered its creation.
    - cross_size: Each arm of the cross extends one pixel in each direction from the center. Total size is always 3x3.

  actions:
    - find_non_zero: Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not zero.
    - create_cross: Generate a cross shape centered at a specified location with a specified color. The size of the cross is fixed - each arm extends one pixel from the center.
    - copy_value: The values of cross are copied to the output grid.
    - overwrite: if crosses overlap, the last cross drawn will determine the pixel value.
