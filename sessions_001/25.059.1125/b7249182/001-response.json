The transformation seems to involve identifying specific colored pixels in the input and creating cross-like shapes of those colors in the output, centered on the original pixel locations. The size and orientation of the cross appear to be consistent within each example and across examples, but the input grids vary in dimension. There's likely a fixed cross pattern that's applied whenever a non-zero pixel is encountered in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
