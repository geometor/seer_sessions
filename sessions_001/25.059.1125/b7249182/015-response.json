Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary difference lies in the arrangement and presence of non-zero values. The input grid seems sparse, with only two non-zero pixels, while the output grid has an expanded, cross-like shape formed from the original non-zero pixels. The colors of the original pixels are maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
