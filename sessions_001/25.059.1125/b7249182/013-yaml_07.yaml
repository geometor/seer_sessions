facts:
  - object_types:
    - pixel: Individual grid cell with a color value.
    - grid: 2D array of pixels.
  - object_properties:
    - color: Value representing the pixel's color (0-9).
    - coordinates: (row, column) position of a pixel within the grid.
  - actions:
    - find_pixel: Locate a pixel of a specific color within a grid.
    - horizontal_fill: Fill a row segment with a color, bounded by specific coordinates or grid edges.
    - vertical_fill: Filling all rows based on one generated row.
  - constraints:
      - fill_colors: Green (3) and Blue (1) are used for filling.
      - grid_size: Output grid has same dimension as the input.
  - logic:
      - anchor_pixels: Green and blue pixels act as starting/ending points for the fill.
      - fill_direction: Horizontal, from green to left edge and from blue to right edge.
      - fill_midpoint: Space between anchors is split at the mid point.
      - fill_replication: Single row is generated, all rows use this pattern.
