Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), and blue (1). The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with a specific pattern emerging around the originally placed green and blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The sequences starts at the left boundary and are connected at their mid point.\n\n4.  **Vertical Replication**:\n    *   Replicate the created sequence of green and blue pixels vertically, both up and down by two rows.
