Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and strategize improvements.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a cross-creation transformation, where each non-zero pixel in the input becomes a cross of the same color in the output. The extension of the cross is fixed at 2.  The provided results show the transform function and execution on the training sets. By visual inspection, it appears the code works on the first example, but fails on the second, and third example.

The core issue seems to be that the code *always* creates a cross, and it *always* uses an extension of 2. The examples show that this isn't the universal rule. We need to:

1.  **Conditional Cross Creation:** Determine *when* a cross is created, not just assume it always is. There might be a specific color, pattern, or context that triggers the cross.
2.  **Variable Extension:** The extension of the cross isn't always 2. It might depend on the surrounding pixels, the color, or some other property.
3. **Overwriting**: when the crosses are placed, existing pixels are overwritten.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To gather precise metrics, I'll describe what I *expect* to see when counting colored pixels in both input and output, and also describe the expected output based on a visual assesment.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** 1 blue, 1 red, 1 green, 1 yellow, 1 gray pixel.
    *   **Expected Output (Visual):**  Crosses of the same colors centered on the original pixel locations.  Each cross, with extension 2, has 9 pixel.
    *   **Expected Pixel Count (Output):** If there were no overlap of the plus sign placement: 9 blue, 9 red, 9 green, 9 yellow, 9 gray.
    * **Actual Output** same as Expected

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** 3 orange, 1 magenta, 1 azure.
    *  **Expected Output (Visual):** Only the single magenta should become a plus, the orange pixels are unchanged.
    *  **Expected Pixel Count (Output):** 3 orange, 9 magenta, 1 azure
    * **Actual Output**: all input pixels turned into crosses - this indicates the program should not transform every non-zero pixel.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** 3 red, 2 yellow, 2 green, 3 blue.
    *   **Expected Output (Visual):** Only the 3 red and 3 blue pixels become a cross, with different extensions.
    *   **Expected Pixel Count (Output):** 9 red, 2 yellow, 2 green, 9 blue.
    * **Actual Output**: all input pixels turned into crosses - this indicates the program should not transform every non-zero pixel.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Trigger Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid. Not all pixels trigger transformation. Determine, based on color or local, if the pixel should change. Based on the limited examples, we know that *some* of blue, red, magenta, grey pixels *can* be triggers.
2.  **Conditional Transformation:** If a pixel is a trigger pixel, create a cross-shaped pattern of the *same color* centered on the pixel location in the output grid.
3.  **Cross Extension:** The "size" or extension of the cross is 2, meaning the cross extends two pixels in each direction (up, down, left, right) from the center.
4. **Preserve other pixels:** All pixels that are not transformed should be copied from the input to the output
5. **Overwriting**: When applying the crosses, later crosses overwrite previous pixels.

Revised Program to account for observations

1. **Identify Trigger Pixels**: Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is red, blue, or magenta, it is considered a "trigger pixel".
2. **Conditional Transformation:** If a pixel is a trigger pixel, create a cross-shaped pattern of the same color centered on the pixel's location in the output grid.
3. **Cross Extension**: The "size" or extension of the cross is 2, meaning the cross extends two pixels *in all four directions* from the center.
4. **Preserve other pixels:** All pixels that are not part of a generated cross should have their value copied directly from the input grid to the output grid.
5. **Overwriting**: When applying the crosses, later crosses overwrite previous pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
