Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0. These pixels act as the centers of crosses.
2.  **Create Crosses:** For each non-zero pixel:
    *   Create a cross shape centered at the pixel's original location (row, column).
    *   The cross is formed from pixels of the *same color* as the original pixel.
    * The cross consists of a horizontal line and a vertical line.
    *   Each arm of the cross extends *one* pixel away from the center. Meaning the total width and height of the cross is 3 pixels.
3.  **Output:** The output grid is initialized as all zeros. Crosses are drawn onto this grid. If crosses overlap, the pixel value of the most recently drawn cross is used.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
