            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of creating crosses centered on non-zero pixels. However, the original implementation had errors in how large the crosses extended. The provided test runs show cases where it overshot and extended the crosses throughout the whole row/column, rather than stopping.  The natural language description also incorrectly stated the cross arms were always 3 pixels in width/height.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Results:** Carefully examine the `train_example_input`, `train_example_output`, and `train_example_result` for *each* training pair. Note specifically where the `train_example_result` differs from the `train_example_output`.\n2.  **Refine Cross Size:** The most obvious error is in the `create_cross` function. The original code was filling entire rows and columns. It must draw lines of fixed length centered at the identified pixel. The correct behavior is that each arm of the cross extends only one pixel in each direction from the center. This creates total width/height of 3 for the whole cross.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to reflect the corrected cross creation logic, specifically including size of the cross and relationship to the center.\n4. **Document the observations**: Create a YAML block with observations related to the context, assumptions, objects and actions.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**\n\nSince I don't have an interactive environment, I can't execute code. If I could, I would use numpy to compare `train_example_output` and `train_example_result` element-wise to get exact difference counts. I would print out sections of the grids for visual comparison. I cannot provide those results here. Based on my review, the results provided in the prompt, all 'train_example_results' extend crosses to the border of the grid, while the 'train_example_output' images have smaller crosses.\n\n**YAML Block (Observations):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  context:\n    - The task involves transforming a grid of pixels.\n    - Non-zero pixels are significant and trigger a transformation.\n    - The transformation involves creating a new shape.\n    - Zero-valued pixels remain unchanged, unless overlapped by a shape.\n\n  objects:\n    - input_grid: A 2D array of integers representing pixel colors.\n    - output_grid: A 2D array of integers, initially all zeros, representing the transformed result.\n    - non_zero_pixels: Individual pixels within the input_grid with values other than 0.\n    - cross: A shape formed by horizontal and vertical lines intersecting at a center point.\n    - center: The original location of a non-zero pixel.\n    - horizontal_line: part of cross\n    - vertical_line: part of cross\n\n  properties:\n    - pixel_value: An integer (0-9) representing the color of a pixel.\n    - center_coordinates: A tuple (row, col) representing the location of a non-zero pixel.\n    - cross_color: The same as the `pixel_value` of the non-zero pixel that triggered its creation.\n    - cross_size: Each arm of the cross extends one pixel in each direction from the center. Total size is always 3x3.\n\n  actions:\n    - find_non_zero: Identify all pixels in the input grid that are not zero.\n    - create_cross: Generate a cross shape centered at a specified location with a specified color. The size of the cross is fixed - each arm extends one pixel from the center.\n    - copy_value: The values of cross are copied to the output grid.\n    - overwrite: if crosses overlap, the last cross drawn will determine the pixel value.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a value other than 0. These pixels act as the centers of crosses.\n2.  **Create Crosses:** For each non-zero pixel:\n    *   Create a cross shape centered at the pixel's original location (row, column).\n    *   The cross is formed from pixels of the *same color* as the original pixel.\n    * The cross consists of a horizontal line and a vertical line.\n    *   Each arm of the cross extends *one* pixel away from the center. Meaning the total width and height of the cross is 3 pixels.\n3.  **Output:** The output grid is initialized as all zeros. Crosses are drawn onto this grid. If crosses overlap, the pixel value of the most recently drawn cross is used.\n\n"
