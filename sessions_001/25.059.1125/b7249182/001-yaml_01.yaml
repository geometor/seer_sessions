facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are 2D arrays of integers, representing colors.
  - object_identification: |
      Non-zero pixels in the input grid are treated as seed points.
  - object_properties:
      - seed_color: Color of the seed pixel (input).
      - cross_color:  Same as seed_color (output).
      - cross_shape: A cross or plus (+) shape.
      - cross_size: A fixed size, extending two pixels in each cardinal direction from the center.
  - action: |
      Create a cross shape in the output grid, centered on the seed point.
  - relationship: |
       The color of the cross in the output corresponds to the color of the seed pixel in the input.
       All non-zero pixels are converted.
       The arms of each colored cross extend for a fixed distance, or until
       they meet the edge of the grid.
       The background remains unchanged (color 0)
