Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct colored objects within the input grid. An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Scale:** For each object found, create a scaled-up version. The scaled version is a 2x2 square of the same color.
3.  **Reflect:** Create a reflected version of *each* of the scaled objects. The reflection occurs across a horizontal axis. Place the reflected object set such that its top edge begins where the bottom edge of the original scaled object set ends. The horizontal placement (column) of the scaled object and the reflected scaled object will be the same.
4.  **Combine**: The output consists of placing the original scaled object and then the reflected scaled object below.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
