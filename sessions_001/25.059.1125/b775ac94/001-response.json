The primary elements are \"objects,\" defined as contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. The transformations appear to involve combining, potentially mirroring, or modifying these objects based on color and spatial relationships. There's a clear sense of object manipulation, possibly guided by a set of rules for object interaction, combination and mirroring, etc. based on color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

An object is a group of connected pixels of the same color.\n\n2.  **Object Expansion based on Color and Mirroring** For each color present in an object in the input grid, identify and combine adjacent pixels that have the same color. Mirror these combined colored objects on the horizontal and vertical axis.\n\n3.  **Combine Replicated Objects:** Replicate each color-combined object. If the replication causes an overlap, then join the original color pixels with the overlap on color.\n\n4.  **Output Grid:** Construct the output grid with the combined objects.\n\nEssentially, the rule appears to combine objects that have the same color, replicate that color, and combine replicated objects, potentially involving mirroring.\n"
