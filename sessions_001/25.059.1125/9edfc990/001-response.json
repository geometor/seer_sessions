The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The most prominent visual feature is the change in the distribution of white (0) pixels. Non-white pixels appear to be largely unchanged, with the key transformation seemingly involving replacing some white pixels with blue (1) pixels. The distribution of the new blue pixels doesn't appear random; they seem to fill in gaps or create solid lines where there were previously scattered white pixels.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

The exact method for determining neighbor need to be determined.\n4. **Change Color**: Change the color of the original white (0) pixel to blue (1).\n5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** If a pixel is not white, its color and position remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nThe core concept is a conditional fill of white pixels based on their surrounding neighbors. It appears that many, most, or all of the white pixels are replaced with blue.\n"
