The primary change appears to be the replacement of '0' (white) pixels with '1' (blue) pixels, but this replacement seems contextual, hinting at a rule more complex than simple global substitution. The non-zero pixels mostly remain unchanged, acting perhaps as boundaries or anchors, but the subtle change with the '2' and the '0' next to it is worth noting.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This creates a \"filling\" effect.\n\n3. In examining the output, a pixel with value '2' and an adjacent pixel with value '0' did switch to '0' and '2' respectively, suggesting that some specific color pairs may undergo a position switch.\n\n4.  **Border Exception**: If pixel on border is 0, do not apply transformation (fill).\n\nIn summary, the transformation rule is a context-sensitive fill operation. White ('0') pixels adjacent to any non-white pixel are converted to blue ('1'), with the change propagating outwards. There are potentially exceptions for number pairs in certain configurations.\n"
