Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9). The primary change appears to be the replacement of '0' (white) pixels with '1' (blue) pixels, but this replacement seems contextual, hinting at a rule more complex than simple global substitution. The non-zero pixels mostly remain unchanged, acting perhaps as boundaries or anchors, but the subtle change with the '2' and the '0' next to it is worth noting.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 13
      columns: 13
      cells: pixels
      colors: 0-9  # Representing a range of colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    properties:
      source_color: 0
      target_color: 1
      conditions:
          - Adjacent to non-zero pixel (horizontal, vertical, or potentially diagonal).
          - Check if replacing a chain results in 1s, i.e., a "filling" behavior.
          - Except on the border, unless the border pixel has value '0'.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are adjacent horizontally, vertically, and potentially diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Scan the input grid and locate all pixels with the value '0' (white).

2.  **Conditional Replacement:** For each '0' pixel:
    *   Check its immediate neighbors (horizontally and vertically).
    *   If *any* neighbor has a non-zero value, change the '0' pixel to '1' (blue).
    *   Propagate this change: If a '0' is changed to '1', re-check its neighbors (that are still '0') to see if *they* now meet the replacement condition. This creates a "filling" effect.

3. In examining the output, a pixel with value '2' and an adjacent pixel with value '0' did switch to '0' and '2' respectively, suggesting that some specific color pairs may undergo a position switch.

4.  **Border Exception**: If pixel on border is 0, do not apply transformation (fill).

In summary, the transformation rule is a context-sensitive fill operation. White ('0') pixels adjacent to any non-white pixel are converted to blue ('1'), with the change propagating outwards. There are potentially exceptions for number pairs in certain configurations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
