The primary change seems to be a flood-fill type operation, where regions of a particular color are replaced, or \"flooded,\" with another color, specifically blue (represented by the digit '1'). The flooding doesn't seem to affect all regions of the same color universally, suggesting a conditional or localized effect based on proximity.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
