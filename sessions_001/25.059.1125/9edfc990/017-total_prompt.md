Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into distinct regions. A region is defined as a group of orthogonally connected pixels of the same color.

2.  **Conditional Flood Fill:** For each pixel in the input grid do the next step.

3.  **Replace with blue:** Examine the pixel in the input. If the color of the input pixel isn't blue, then check for the color in the corresponding pixel in the output grid. If that output color is blue, replace the current pixel in a copy of the input grid by blue.

4. **Output Result**: The copy of the grid with the replaced color is the final output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
