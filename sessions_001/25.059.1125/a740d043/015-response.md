Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves extracting a specific region from a larger grid. The input grid contains a 2x2 block of pixels that are different from the surrounding pixels. This block is composed of two colors: gray (5) and magenta (6). The output grid consists only of this 2x2 block, maintaining the original colors and arrangement. The surrounding blue (1) pixels are removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [1, 5, 6]
      dimensions: [7, 6]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [5, 6]
      dimensions: [3, 2]
  - name: inner_block
    type: subgrid
    properties:
       colors: [5,6]
       dimensions: [2,2]
       location:
            top_left: [3,2]
            
actions:
  - type: extraction
    agent: SEER
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Extract the 2x2 inner block of non-blue pixels.

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: inner_block
  - type: equals
    from: output_grid
    to: inner_block
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target:** Locate the contiguous 2x2 block of pixels within the input grid where all pixels are not blue (1).
2.  **Isolate Target:** Isolate the colors within target block.
3.  **Extract:** Create the output grid consisting of only that 2x2 block, which might consist of different colors.

Essentially, the program extracts a specific colored region from the input image, discarding the background.
