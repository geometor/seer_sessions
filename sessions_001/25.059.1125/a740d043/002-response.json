Identify Non-Blue Objects: Examine the input grid and locate all contiguous blocks of pixels that are *not* blue (value 1). These blocks can be of any shape and color other than blue.\n2. Consider White Objects: Examine if the output grid includes white colored pixels (value 0). White pixels might be included between the extracted objects.\n3. Create Output Grid: Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions of this grid are not fixed but are determined by the arrangement of the identified non-blue (and possibly white) objects.\n4. Populate Output Grid: Transfer the non-blue (and white) objects from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining the original shape/colors of each extracted parts. Arrange those parts such that any gaps between the non-blue pixels in the input are closed.\n\nIn simple terms: the input shows some non-blue clusters surrounded by blue. Copy all non-blue clusters to a smaller plate, discarding all blue pixels (and maybe keeping white ones), and make a new figure using copied clusters.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects of non-blue pixels in the grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, obj):\n        if (r < 0 or r >= grid.shape[0] or c < 0 or c >= grid.shape[1] or\n                visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] != color):\n            return\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        obj.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, obj)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, obj)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, obj)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, obj)\n\n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if not visited[r, c] and grid[r, c] != 1:\n                obj = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], obj)\n                objects.append(obj)\n    return objects\n                \ndef check_white_inclusion(examples):\n   \"\"\"Check training data to see if any output grids includes white pixels (value 0).\n      Return True if white is present, false otherwise.\n   \"\"\"\n   for example in examples:\n       if 0 in example['output']:\n            return True\n   return False\n                \n\ndef transform(input_grid, examples):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the identified rule.\"\"\"\n    \n    # identify if 0 should be kept or not\n    keep_white = check_white_inclusion(examples)\n\n    # Find non-blue objects\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    \n    # Create a list to store the values and coordinates of object pixels.\n    output_pixels = []\n\n    # Extract and store pixel values\n    for obj in objects:\n        for r, c in obj:\n            output_pixels.append((grid[r,c],r,c))\n\n   # find dimensions and offset for the output pixels\n\n    if len(output_pixels) == 0:\n        return np.array([[]]) # Return empty grid if no non blue pixels\n\n    min_r = min(pixel[1] for pixel in output_pixels)\n    min_c = min(pixel[2] for pixel in output_pixels)\n\n    max_r = max(pixel[1] for pixel in output_pixels)\n    max_c = max(pixel[2] for pixel in output_pixels)\n\n    # calculate height and width based on position of pixels\n    height = 0\n    width = 0\n\n    pixel_positions = []\n\n    for value, r, c in output_pixels:\n        new_r = r - min_r\n        new_c = c - min_c\n\n        height = max(height, new_r + 1) # at least 1\n        width = max(width, new_c + 1) # at least 1\n\n        pixel_positions.append((value, new_r, new_c))\n        \n    # Initialize output grid\n    output_grid = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)\n\n    # Populate output grid with the values extracted from the objects\n    for value, r, c in pixel_positions:\n        output_grid[r, c] = value\n    return output_grid\n```"
