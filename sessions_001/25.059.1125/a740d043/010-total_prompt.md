**input:**
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 3 1 2 1 1
1 1 3 1 2 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7F4C2318BDD0>

**output:**
```
3 0 2
3 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x128 at 0x7F4C1A589B50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 7x7 grid, predominantly filled with blue (1) pixels.  There are two distinct regions: a 2x1 block of green (3) pixels and a 2x1 block of red (2) pixels. The output is a 2x3 grid. The output grid contains only the colors green (3), white/background (0), and red (2), arranged horizontally. The background color is not present in the original input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
        count: 45  #  Calculated (7*7) - 4
      - color: green
        value: 3
        count: 2
      - color: red
        value: 2
        count: 2

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 2x3
    elements:
       - color: green
         value: 3
         count: 2
       - color: white
         value: 0
         count: 2
       - color: red
         value: 2
         count: 2

  - name: green_region
    type: object
    color: green
    value: 3
    shape: rectangle #inferred
    dimensions: 2x1 #inferred

  - name: red_region
    type: object
    color: red
    value: 2
    shape: rectangle #inferred
    dimensions: 2x1 #inferred

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: [green_region, red_region]
  - type: represents #Inferred. represents colors in the new configuration
    from: output_grid
    to: [green_region, red_region]
  - type: color_change
    from: blue
    to: white

actions:
    - type: extract
      target: [green_region,red_region]
      from: input_grid
    - type: arrange
      target: [green, white,red]
      mode: horizontal
    - type: duplicate
      target: [green,white,red]
      mode: row
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct colored regions within the input grid, ignoring the most frequent color (blue/1 in this case)
2.  **Extract Colors:**  Extract the colors of these regions, including what remains of the most frequent color (white/0)
3.  **Arrange Horizontally:** Create a new horizontal sequence of the unique colors, in order Green, White and Red
4.  **Duplicate row:** Repeat this sequence to add another identical row below the first. The new dimensions are number of unique colors x 2 rows.
5. **Output:** Output the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
