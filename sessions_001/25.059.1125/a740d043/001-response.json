The input grids predominantly consist of '1' (blue) pixels, with a few pixels of other colors forming distinct shapes. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation, retaining only the non-blue pixels and sometimes the 0 (white) pixels, from the input grid, while changing the size and shape.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These blocks can be of any shape and color other than blue.\n2. **Consider White Objects:** Examine if the output grid includes white colored pixels (value 0). White pixels might be included between the extracted objects.\n3. **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, smaller grid. The dimensions of this grid are not fixed but are determined by the arrangement of the identified non-blue (and possibly white) objects.\n4. **Populate Output Grid:** Transfer the non-blue (and white) objects from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining the original shape/colors of each extracted parts. Arrange those parts such that any gaps between the non-blue pixels in the input are closed.\n\nIn simple terms: the input shows some non-blue clusters surrounded by blue. Copy all non-blue clusters to a smaller plate, discarding all blue pixels (and maybe keeping white ones), and make a new figure using copied clusters.\n"
