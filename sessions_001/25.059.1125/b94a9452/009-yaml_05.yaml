      description: The output is the color invert of the original center object, and then cropping to the smallest grid.

  - action: invert
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid, all non white pixel
    description:  blue becomes green and green becomes blue

  - action: crop
    source: all non white pixels and their colored neighbors
    target: output_grid
    description: create a grid containing only object and colored neighbors.
