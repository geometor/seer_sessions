"""
1.  **Identify the Central Object:** Locate the contiguous non-white pixels in the input grid. In this case, find the horizontal line of blue pixels and the single green pixel.
2.  **Color Inversion:** Invert the color of the central non-white area. It means change the color of pixel '1' to '3', and change color of '3' to '1'.
3. **Cropping and Extraction:** Extract the smallest possible square region that encompasses the colored pixels and its immediate neighbors. This 3x3 area forms the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against all the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a reasonable hypothesis (color inversion and cropping) derived from the first example. However, running it on all examples reveals that this hypothesis is incomplete. Some examples match perfectly, while others have discrepancies in size and pixel colors.

The strategy to improve the solution will involve these steps:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Examine each input/output/predicted_output triplet.  Identify precisely *where* the prediction deviates from the expected output (size differences, incorrect pixel values, etc.).
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:**  Based on the error analysis, adjust the initial hypothesis. The core idea of focusing on non-white pixels and potentially inverting *some* colors seems relevant, but the cropping logic and conditions for color inversion need refinement.  It's possible we need to consider relative positions of different colored pixels.
3.  **Iterative Testing:** After modifying the natural language program (and subsequently the code), re-test on *all* examples and repeat the error analysis.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Detailed Observations**

I'll use `code_execution` to generate reports comparing predicted and expected outputs for each example, by providing the `report` function with the `transform` function, example input, and expected output. This will give detailed metrics on matching areas and mismatches.

```python
def report(transform, in_grid, out_grid):
    predicted_grid = transform(in_grid)
    if predicted_grid == out_grid:
        return "Correct"
    
    report = {
      "match":False,
      "correct_pixels": 0,
      "incorrect_pixels": 0,
      "total_pixels_predicted": 0,
      "total_pixels_expected": 0,
      "predicted_shape": [],
      "output_shape": [],
    }

    if predicted_grid is not None and out_grid is not None:
        report["predicted_shape"] = [len(predicted_grid), len(predicted_grid[0]) if predicted_grid else 0]
        report["output_shape"] = [len(out_grid), len(out_grid[0]) if out_grid else 0]
        
        min_rows = min(len(predicted_grid), len(out_grid))
        min_cols = min(len(predicted_grid[0]) if predicted_grid else 0, len(out_grid[0]) if out_grid else 0)

        for i in range(min_rows):
            for j in range(min_cols):
                if predicted_grid[i][j] == out_grid[i][j]:
                    report["correct_pixels"] += 1
                else:
                    report["incorrect_pixels"] += 1

        report["total_pixels_predicted"] = report["predicted_shape"][0] * report["predicted_shape"][1]
        report["total_pixels_expected"] = report["output_shape"][0] * report["output_shape"][1]
        report['match'] = predicted_grid == out_grid

    return report
```

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the horizontal line of blue pixels and the single green pixel.
2.  **Conditional Color Inversion:**
    *   If the green pixel is *below* the blue line, invert the colors of the blue line and the green pixel (blue becomes green, green becomes blue).
    *   If the green pixel is *within* the vertical projection of the blue line, do *not* invert colors.
3.  **Cropping:**
    * If the colors were inverted: Crop to a rectangular region that includes all non-white pixels and one pixel of padding on all sides.
    * If the colors were *not* inverted: Create a rectangle that encompasses the row of the blue horizontal line and the single green pixel. The rectangle's width should cover from the start of the blue line to whichever is further to the right, the end of the blue line or the green pixel, and start from where is leftmost between the beginning of the blue line and the green pixel.

This revised program accounts for the conditional color inversion observed in Example 4 and the different cropping behavior.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
