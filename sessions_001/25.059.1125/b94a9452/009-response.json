There's a small, centered, partially-colored shape within it. The shape is composed of a horizontal line of three blue pixels, with a green pixel directly below the center blue pixel, and another row identical to the top row below the green pixel. The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid.  It appears the colors have been inverted in some areas, and the output is a zoomed-in and cropped representation, possibly of an \"inverse\" color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

In this case, find the horizontal line of blue pixels and the single green pixel.\n2.  **Color Inversion:** Invert the color of the central non-white area. It means change the color of pixel '1' to '3', and change color of '3' to '1'.\n3. **Cropping and Extraction:** Extract the smallest possible square region that encompasses the colored pixels and its immediate neighbors. This 3x3 area forms the output grid.\n"
