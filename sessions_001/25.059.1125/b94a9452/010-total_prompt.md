Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (12x11) mostly filled with zeros (white pixels).  There's a small, centered, partially-colored shape within it. The shape is composed of a horizontal line of three blue pixels, with a green pixel directly below the center blue pixel, and another row identical to the top row below the green pixel. The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid.  It appears the colors have been inverted in some areas, and the output is a zoomed-in and cropped representation, possibly of an "inverse" color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 12x11
    elements:
      - color: white # 0
        dominant: true
      - color: blue # 1
        shape: horizontal line segment, length 3
      - color: green # 3
        shape: single pixel, centered below the blue line

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: green # 3
        dominant: true
      - color: blue #1
        shape: single pixel, centered

  - relationship:
      type: transformation
      description: The output is the color invert of the original center object, and then cropping to the smallest grid.

  - action: invert
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid, all non white pixel
    description:  blue becomes green and green becomes blue

  - action: crop
    source: all non white pixels and their colored neighbors
    target: output_grid
    description: create a grid containing only object and colored neighbors.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Central Object:** Locate the contiguous non-white pixels in the input grid. In this case, find the horizontal line of blue pixels and the single green pixel.
2.  **Color Inversion:** Invert the color of the central non-white area. It means change the color of pixel '1' to '3', and change color of '3' to '1'.
3. **Cropping and Extraction:** Extract the smallest possible square region that encompasses the colored pixels and its immediate neighbors. This 3x3 area forms the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
