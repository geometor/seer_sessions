The input grid contains a central \"object\" composed of red (2) and yellow (4) pixels, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a zoomed-in and slightly altered representation of the central object in the input grid. The colors are preserved, but there's a change in the arrangement and potentially the relative size of colored regions. The output seems to extract the smallest square containing all non-zero pixels and inverts it.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
