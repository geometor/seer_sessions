Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation fills contiguous horizontal runs of white pixels with green, row by row, starting from the top-left. The fill operation in a given row is either interrupted by existing red pixels, or fills a gap between them completely. Then fill extends to the end of rows.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    for r in range(rows):
        filling = False
        for c in range(cols):
            # Start filling if we encounter a white pixel and are not already filling
            if output_grid[r, c] == 0 and not filling:
                filling = True
                output_grid[r,c] = 3
            # If filling and see red, stop filling for this gap.
            elif filling and output_grid[r,c] == 2:
              filling = False
            # fill
            elif filling and output_grid[r,c] == 0:
                output_grid[r,c] = 3

        # extend fill to right of image if row starts with 3
        if output_grid[r,0] == 3:
            for c in range(cols):
                output_grid[r,c] = 3


    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, capturing the basic idea of filling horizontal white spaces with green. However, the extension to the right edge of the image, unconditionally if the row starts with green (value 3) is incorrect. The filling should stop when encountering a red pixel (value 2). The examples clearly demonstrate this behavior. The code over-extends the fill. We need to modify filling behavior to only extend if not blocked by red.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of the expected output and the actual output of the `transform` function. I will leverage my ability to visually process the image to derive these metrics, and use the results to define a more complete YAML block and program.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A single horizontal line of white pixels.
    *   Expected Output: A single horizontal line of green pixels.
    *   Actual Output: Correct.
    *   Observation: The basic horizontal fill works.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Multiple horizontal lines, some with red pixels interrupting white spaces.
    *   Expected Output: Green fills the white spaces between the red pixels, and fills to the edge if no blocking red pixel.
    *   Actual Output: Incorrect. Extends all green fills to end.
    *   Observation: The red pixels correctly stop the *initial* fill, but the conditional extension based purely on starting with color 3 in the first column is incorrect.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: Similar to example 2, with different arrangements of red and white pixels.
    *    Expected Output: Green filling between and around red blocks, and if the fill reaches the edge.
    *   Actual Output: Incorrect. Same error as example 2.
    *   Observation: Further confirms that the filling logic needs adjustment when a row starts with green, and must consider intermediate red pixels.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - cells: Individual pixels within the grid.
  - name: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: A numerical value representing the pixel's color (0-9).
      - row: The row index of the pixel.
      - col: The column index of the pixel.
  - name: horizontal_run
    description: contiguous block of pixels of same color in a row
    properties:
      - color: color of pixels
      - start: (row, col) of leftmost pixel
      - end: (row, col) of rightmost pixel

actions:
  - name: fill
    description: Change the color of pixels in a horizontal run.
    parameters:
      - start_color: initial color in run
      - end_color: final color
      - blocking_color: color which stops filling
    constraints:
        - filling begins when a pixel matching `start_color` is encountered
        - filling stops when a pixel matching `blocking_color` is encountered
        - filling applies only within a single row.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate through each row** of the input grid.
2.  **Within each row, scan from left to right.**
3.  **Identify contiguous horizontal runs of white pixels (color 0).**
4.  **For each identified run:**
    *   **Begin filling** the run with green pixels (color 3).
    *  **Stop filling** if a red pixel (color 2) is encountered.
    * **Continue filling** to the right end of row if started and not blocked by red.

The crucial change from the previous version is the clear condition on when to stop filling to the right. The prior version always filled to the edge.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
