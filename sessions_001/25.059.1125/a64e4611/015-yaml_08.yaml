objects:
  - name: grid
    description: A 2D array of pixels.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      - cols: Number of columns in the grid.
      - cells: Individual pixels within the grid.
  - name: pixel
    description: A single cell in the grid.
    properties:
      - color: A numerical value representing the pixel's color (0-9).
      - row: The row index of the pixel.
      - col: The column index of the pixel.
  - name: horizontal_run
    description: contiguous block of pixels of same color in a row
    properties:
      - color: color of pixels
      - start: (row, col) of leftmost pixel
      - end: (row, col) of rightmost pixel

actions:
  - name: fill
    description: Change the color of pixels in a horizontal run.
    parameters:
      - start_color: initial color in run
      - end_color: final color
      - blocking_color: color which stops filling
    constraints:
        - filling begins when a pixel matching `start_color` is encountered
        - filling stops when a pixel matching `blocking_color` is encountered
        - filling applies only within a single row.
