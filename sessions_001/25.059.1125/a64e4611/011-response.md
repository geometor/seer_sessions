Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a simple rectangular blue boundary enclosing white pixels that were changed to green. The subsequent examples reveal that this initial assumption is too narrow. There are cases with incomplete boundaries, multiple potential boundaries and boundaries within boundaries. The code needs to correctly identify the *outermost* valid, complete rectangular blue boundary and fill only the white pixels enclosed by *that* boundary. The current code doesn't handle incomplete or nested boundaries properly, it fails to handle edge cases.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Improve Boundary Detection:** The `is_rectangular_boundary` function needs to be more robust. It should prioritize the *outermost* complete rectangle.
2.  **Handle Incomplete Boundaries:** The logic should not perform any replacement if a complete, rectangular blue boundary is not found.
3.  **Handle Nested Boundaries:** consider only the outermost.
4. **Prioritize outermost boundry**

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand what went wrong, it is useful to check each of the examples and
compare with the results.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct) The code correctly identified the blue boundary and filled the enclosed white pixels with green.
*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect) There's an incomplete blue rectangle. The current code incorrectly fills a region.
*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect) There are nested blue rectangles. The current program must consider the outer rectangle.
*   **Example 4:** (Incorrect) There is an incomplete outer blue rectangle, with two inner ones.
*   **Example 5:** (Incorrect) There are blue pixels not forming a rectangle and no action should be taken.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml

  - example_1:
      status: correct
      objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: blue
          boundary: complete
          encloses: white pixels
        - type: region
          color: white
          enclosed_by: blue rectangle
      action: replace enclosed white pixels with green
  - example_2:
      status: incorrect
      objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: blue
          boundary: incomplete

  - example_3:
      status: incorrect
      objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: blue
          boundary: complete
          outermost: true
          encloses: white pixels and another blue rectangle
        - type: rectangle
            color: blue
            boundary: complete
            outermost: false
        - type: region
          color: white
          enclosed_by: outer blue rectangle
      action: replace white pixels enclosed by outermost blue rectangle with green
  - example_4:
      status: incorrect
      objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: blue
          boundary: incomplete
          outermost: true
      action: none
  - example_5:
      status: incorrect
      objects:
        - type: scattered_pixels
          color: blue
      action: none
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Determine if the blue pixels form one or more complete rectangles. A complete rectangle has a continuous blue border with no gaps.
3.  If multiple complete blue rectangles are present, select the outermost rectangle. The outermost rectangle is the one that is not contained within any other rectangle.
4. If no or incomplete rectangle are present, do nothing.
5.  If a single, complete, outermost blue rectangle is found, identify the white (0) pixels enclosed within this rectangle.
6.  Replace the enclosed white pixels with green (3) pixels.
7.  Pixels outside the outermost blue rectangle, including the blue pixels forming the rectangle, remain unchanged.
