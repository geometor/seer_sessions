Okay, I'm ready to analyze this ARC-AGI task example. Here's my breakdown of the input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are:

*   **Pixels:** Individual cells in the grid, represented by digits 0-9, corresponding to different colors.
*   **Grid:** A 2D array of pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   **Colors:** The input grid uses primarily azure (8) and white (0). The output grid introduces green (3) while retaining azure and white.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: background
    type: grid_region
    properties:
      color: [white]
      shape: rectangle
      size: variable
  - name: azure_region_1
    type: grid_region
    properties:
      color: [azure]
      shape: irregular
      size: variable
  - name: azure_region_2
    type: grid_region
    properties:
      color: [azure]
      shape: irregular
      size: variable
  - name: green_region
    type: grid_region
    properties:
        color: [ green ]
        shape: irregular
        size: variable

actions:
  - name: fill
    agent: system
    target: azure_region
    properties:
      color: green
      condition: "enclosed by azure and adjacent to background"

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    objects: [azure_region, background]
    property: side_by_side

  - type: inside_bounds
    object_property: bounding_box
    objects: [green_region, azure_region_1]

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Enclosure and adjacency Check:** for each azure region, perform step 3.
3.  **Fill with green:** find the bounding box of the azure object. Find all white
    pixels inside this bounding box, if any, that are adjacent to any azure
    pixel of the current region, replace these white pixels with green (3).
    Pixels are adjacent side by side or diagonally.

In summary the rule replaces white pixels in regions enclosed by connected azure
pixels with green pixels, but only those white pixels that are also adjacent to
azure pixels.
