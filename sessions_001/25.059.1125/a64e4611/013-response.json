The primary change appears to be the introduction of a large green (3) region, seemingly related to the distribution of white (0) pixels in the input. The red (2) pixels seem to define some sort of a boundary, although this changes slightly and is not as obvious.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Do this for all of the rows, but then, in any row that starts with a value of 3, extend that to fill the entire rest of the row, from left to right.\n\nEssentially, the transformation fills contiguous horizontal runs of white pixels with green, row by row, starting from the top-left. The fill operation in a given row is either interrupted by existing red pixels, or fills a gap between them completely. Then fill extends to the end of rows.\n"
