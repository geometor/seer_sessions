The transformation fills contiguous horizontal runs of white pixels with green, row by row. The fill operation in a given row is interrupted by red pixels. If a row starts with a white pixel and is filled with green and there are no interrupting red pixels, the fill extends to the end of the row.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program captured a significant part of the transformation rule: filling horizontal runs of white pixels with green, interrupted by red pixels. However, the "extend fill to the right" logic seems flawed and doesn't correctly handle all cases, especially when there's interspersed red pixels. The current rule to expand filling to the end if not blocked, does not apply for all examples.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output/predicted output triplet. Pay close attention to the starting conditions of each row, the presence of red pixels, and where the filling stops. Use code execution to extract precise coordinates and colors.
2.  **Identify Incorrect Assumptions:** Pinpoint where the current logic fails. The core issue is the extension logic not working correctly for all examples.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the observed behavior.
4. Prepare a YAML block to use in creating the updated python function.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I'll use code execution to gather precise data about each example. I will focus especially on when the initial pixel is 0, and the presence and location of any '2' (red pixels).

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    analysis = []
    for r in range(rows):
        row_info = {
            'row': r,
            'start_color': input_grid[r, 0],
            'red_positions': [],
            'output_colors': [],
            'predicted_colors': []
        }
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] == 2:
                row_info['red_positions'].append(c)
            row_info['output_colors'].append(output_grid[r,c])
            row_info['predicted_colors'].append(predicted_grid[r,c])
        analysis.append(row_info)
    return analysis

# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)
examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0]]),
        "predicted": np.array([[3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0]])
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]]),
        "predicted": np.array([[3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]])
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]]),

        "predicted": np.array([[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]])
    },
    {
        "input": np.array([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]),
        "predicted": np.array([[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])
    }

]

for i, example in enumerate(examples):
    analysis = analyze_example(example['input'], example['output'], example['predicted'])
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    for row_info in analysis:
        print(f"  Row {row_info['row']}:")
        print(f"    Starts with: {row_info['start_color']}")
        print(f"    Red positions: {row_info['red_positions']}")
        print(f"   Output: {row_info['output_colors']}")
        print(f"   Predicted: {row_info['predicted_colors']}")
        print(f"   Correct: {np.array_equal(row_info['output_colors'],row_info['predicted_colors'])}")
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
