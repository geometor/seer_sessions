The input grid contains a cluster of gray (5) and maroon (9) pixels, primarily concentrated in the top-right corner. The output grid appears to be a 45-degree clockwise rotation of the maroon (9) pixels from the input grid, with the gray (5) pixels being replaced with white (0) pixels. The pivot point of the rotation appears to be the top-right corner of the gray/maroon shape, which is the original location of the top maroon (9) pixel at position (0, 5) in the input, which is the same position as the top maroon (9) in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Consider connected groups of 5 and groups of 9 to be shapes.\n\n2.  **Pivot Identification:** Define the pivot point for rotation. In this case, the pivot is the top-right corner position occupied by the shape formed by the maroon (9) pixels. The very top value 9 pixel at position (0,5).\n\n3.  **Isolate and Rotate:** Isolate the maroon (9) pixels. Rotate only these pixels 45 degrees clockwise around the identified pivot point.\n\n4.  **Replace:** Remove the gray colored pixels (value 5) from the input grid and fill with white (value 0).\n\n5.  **Reconstruct:** Place the rotated maroon (9) pixels into a new grid of the same size, maintaining the background pixels (0) of the original output grid.\n"
