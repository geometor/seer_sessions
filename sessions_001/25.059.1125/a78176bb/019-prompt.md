Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify the Initial Diagonal: Find the longest contiguous diagonal line of red (value 2) pixels starting from the top-left cell (0, 0) of the input grid.  The length of this diagonal is equal to the smaller of the input grid's dimensions, because the diagonals are complete across the grid.
2. Replicate the Diagonal: Replicate the red color of the initial diagonal across the entire grid. The pattern repeats every `length` pixels, both horizontally and vertically, where length is that of the initial object. This means if a cell's row and column indices, when subtracted and taken modulo `length`, correspond to an index within the initial diagonal, then the cell should have value 2, otherwise 0.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
