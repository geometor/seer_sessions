<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2048x1360 at 0x7F4C1A589150>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing colors. The input grids appear to have diagonal lines of a specific color, and often contain a smaller, contiguous block of a different color, overlapping or adjacent to the diagonal. The output grids seem to retain only the diagonal line, extending it, and removing the smaller block of color. The diagonal always runs from top-left to bottom-right. There also appears to be a secondary diagonal, perpendicular to the main, composed by the color of the principal.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9)
      - height: 10
      - width: 10
  - object: diagonal_line
    properties:
      - type: object
      - color: varies (7, 9, 2 in examples)
      - orientation: top-left to bottom-right
      - description: A sequence of cells of the same color along the main diagonal.
  - object: secondary_diagonal
    properties:
      - type: object
       - color: same as main diagonal.
      - orientation: top-right to bottom-left.
      - description: Cells of the same color of main diagonal.
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous_region
      - color: varies (5 in all examples)
      - shape: rectangle or square, varying size
      - description: A contiguous block of cells, all of the same color.
  - action: remove_block
    description: The block object is removed from the grid.
  - action: extend_diagonal
    description: extend secondary diagonal line to fill all cells perpendicular to the main diagonal.
  - relationship:
      - object1: diagonal_line
        object2: block
        type: may overlap or be adjacent
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Primary Diagonal:** Find the diagonal line of cells running from the top-left to the bottom-right of the input grid. Note the color of this diagonal.
2.  **Identify Secondary Diagonal:** Find the color used to draw the main diagonal. Draw a diagonal from top-right to bottom-left, only on the cells that are 0 (white).
3.  **Identify the Block:** Locate any contiguous block of cells of a color different from the diagonal color and from white (0).
4.  **Remove the Block:** Set the values of all cells within the identified block to 0 (white).
5. **Construct Output.** The output is composed by the two diagonals.

Essentially, the transformation preserves and extends the diagonal line by one cell while removing any other colored contiguous blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
