The primary colors present are red (2), grey (5), and white (0).  The input grid contains a diagonal line of red pixels from the top left, extending downwards.  There's also a cluster of grey and red pixels in the center. The output grid seems to be related to the diagonal replication of the red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
