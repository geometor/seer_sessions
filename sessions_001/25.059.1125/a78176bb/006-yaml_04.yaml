examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        shape: (3, 3)
        main_diagonal: present, color 7
        anti_diagonal: not present
        other_elements: color 5
      output:
        shape: (3, 3)
        main_diagonal: present, color 7
        anti_diagonal: present, color 7
        other_elements: color 0
      transformation:
        - keep main diagonal, change color to 7
        - create anti-diagonal, color 7
        - set all other elements to color 0

  - example_2:
      input:
        shape: (4, 4)
        main_diagonal: present, color 1
        anti_diagonal: not present
        other_elements: color 0
      output:
        shape: (4, 4)
        main_diagonal: present, color 7
        anti_diagonal: present, color 7
        other_elements: color 0

      transformation:
        - keep main diagonal, change color to 7
        - create anti-diagonal, color 7
        - set all other elements to color 0

  - example_3:
      input:
        shape: (5, 5)
        main_diagonal: not present
        anti_diagonal: not present
        other_elements: color 0 and 2 distributed along anti-diagonal
      output:
        shape: (5, 5)
        main_diagonal: not present
        anti_diagonal: present, color 7
        other_elements: color 0
      transformation:
        - create anti-diagonal, color 7
        - set all other elements to color 0
