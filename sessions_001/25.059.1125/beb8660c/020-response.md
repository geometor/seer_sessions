```python
"""
The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The diagonal line is not a consistent feature and should be ignored.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise
    rotated_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)  # k=-1 for 90 degrees clockwise

    # Convert the rotated array back to a list and return
    return rotated_array.tolist()
```

**Reasoning:**

Based on the analysis of all three training examples, the most consistent transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The previous attempt's inclusion of a diagonal line was incorrect, as it was not present in all examples. The shape metrics confirm that `rotated_input_shape` always matches `output_shape` for all three examples. So, only the rotation operation is included.
