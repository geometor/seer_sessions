The primary colors involved are blue (1), red (2), green (3), and azure (8).  The transformation appears to involve a re-arrangement or shifting of these colored blocks. White (0) represents empty space. Crucially, the objects are all horizontal lines. The azure line remains unchanged, while other colored lines appear to shift their position, often exchanging positions with other lines. The overall size of the grid, number of rows, and columns, are unchanged from input to output.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Empty cells remain white (0).\n\nIn summary, it's a vertical re-ordering of the colored lines based upon their input positions, and the availability of empty rows (excluding white, and azure rows) with the azure line acting as a static element.\n"
