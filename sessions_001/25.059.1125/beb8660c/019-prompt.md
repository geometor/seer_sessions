Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  An azure diagonal line is then drawn
from the new top-left corner to the new bottom-right corner.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise
    rotated_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)  # k=-1 for 90 degrees clockwise

    # Create a copy to serve as the output (to draw the line on)
    output_array = np.copy(rotated_array)

    # Get dimensions of the rotated array
    rows, cols = output_array.shape

    # Draw the azure diagonal line
    for i in range(min(rows, cols)):
        output_array[i, i] = 8  # 8 is the color code for azure

    return output_array.tolist()
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
