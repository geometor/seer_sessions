The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The most prominent feature is the rearrangement of colored horizontal lines.  It appears lines of the same color are being treated as single objects. Empty space (represented by 0) acts as padding/filler. The general layout and sizes of the grids seems variable.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Treat each of these lines as a single object.\n2. **Sort/Reorder:** Sort the identified lines based on the order they appear in the input, processing the grid row by row from top to bottom and moving left to right within each row. Reverse the sorted order\n3. **Stack:** Stack the lines on top of each other from bottom to top. Fill empty pixels on top by 0.\n4.  **Output Grid:** Create the output grid by arranging these reordered, stacked lines.\n\nIn simpler terms: The transformation takes the horizontal colored lines from the input, reverses their order of appearance from top-left to bottom-right, and stacks them at the bottom of the output grid. The remaining space at the top is filled with 0.\n"
