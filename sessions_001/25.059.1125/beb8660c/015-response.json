The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid through a rotation operation. The colors (represented by numbers) remain the same, but their positions within the grid change. Specifically, it looks like a 90-degree clockwise rotation. The bottom row remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
