            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a revised natural language program and a YAML block documenting the observations:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code's core logic of rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise is partially correct.  However, the additional detail about preserving a last row is incorrect and also doesn't consider the other crucial aspect of the task: drawing a single azure line connecting corners. The test results, especially on the first three, fail spectacularly.  Test pair #4 looks correct, but the code is certainly over-fit.\n\nThe strategy should be:\n\n1.  **Correct the Basic Rotation:** Focus on the core 90-degree clockwise rotation, because that appears to be the foundational operation.\n2.  **Identify the Connecting Line:**  The key added element is the azure (color 8) line drawn. The problem statement refers to \"diagonals\" and \"connecting\" them. We need to figure out *which* diagonals and how the connection is determined.  It's likely connecting the corners of the original input to a point that extends the diagonal of the input.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Start with rotation, then add the line-drawing logic. The code will likely need a separate step to handle the line.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution where needed - conceptual)**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Output: 3x3\n    *   Rotation Check: If it was *just* rotation, it would be correct visually.\n    *   Line Check: An azure line is drawn from top-left (originally bottom-left) to bottom-right.\n    *   Result: Code fails completely.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 5x5, Output: 5x5\n    *   Rotation Check: Correct rotation.\n    *   Line Check: Azure line connects top-left to bottom-right.\n    *   Result: Code fails completely.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 7x7, Output: 7x7\n    *   Rotation Check: Correct rotation.\n    *   Line Check: Azure line connects top-left to bottom-right.\n    *   Result: Code fails completely.\n*    **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, output: 9x9\n    *   Rotation Check: Correct Rotation.\n    *   Line Check: Azure line connects top-left to bottom-right.\n    *   Result: Code succeeds, but for wrong reason.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts)**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 05f2a901\n  - objects:\n      - grid:\n          properties:\n            - dimensions: variable (square in examples)\n            - colors: multiple\n          actions:\n            - rotate: 90 degrees clockwise\n      - line:\n          properties:\n            - color: azure (8)\n            - start: top-left corner (after rotation)\n            - end: bottom-right corner (after rotation)\n            - type: diagonal\n          actions:\n            - draw: connects corners\n  - general_rule: |\n      The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  An azure diagonal line is then drawn\n      from the new top-left corner to the new bottom-right corner.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n2.  **Draw Line:** After rotation, draw a straight diagonal line of color azure (8) starting from the top-left corner of the rotated grid and extending to the bottom-right corner of the rotated grid.\n"
