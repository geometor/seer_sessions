Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element seems to be a 2D grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation involves duplicating the input grid horizontally. The output grid is always twice the width of the input grid. The height remains the same. The values within the grid are directly copied to corresponding positions of duplicated part.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D (rows x columns)
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - role: input/output

actions:
  - name: duplicate_horizontally
    description: Replicates the input grid to the right.
    input: grid
    output: grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a horizontal concatenation of the input grid with itself.
    subject: output_grid
    object: input_grid
  - type: dimensional
    description: output width equals twice input width
    property: width
    subject: output_grid
    object: input_grid
    relation: 2x
  - type: dimensional
    description: output height equals input height
    property: height
    subject: output_grid
    object: input_grid
    relation: equal

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Take the input grid.
2.  **Duplicate:** Create an exact copy of the input grid.
3.  **Concatenate:** Place the copy directly to the right of the original input grid.
4.  **Output:** Return the combined grid as the output. The output grid will be the input, doubled in width.
