Previous Code:
```python
"""
The central colored pattern is expanded horizontally. The two central rows in the input grid contain an alternating sequence of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
This pattern is doubled in length horizontally. The rows with white pixels (0) are also expanded. The width gets doubled.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with doubled width, same height, and filled with 0s.
    output_grid = np.zeros((input_grid.shape[0], input_grid.shape[1] * 2), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through each row of the input grid.
    for i in range(input_grid.shape[0]):
        # Check if the row contains the pattern (1s and 2s).
        if 1 in input_grid[i] or 2 in input_grid[i]:
            # Double the pattern horizontally.
            new_row = np.concatenate((input_grid[i], input_grid[i]))

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
