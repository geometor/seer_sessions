Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The grids contain numerical values representing different colors. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2).  The input grid has dimensions 5x8, while output grid appears to have grown in both dimensions. The core pattern of blue and red seems to be retained and expanded, while the surrounding white area also expands.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x8
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
      - value: 2
        color: red
    properties:
        - central_pattern: Two rows of alternating blue and red pixels.

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x16
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 1
        color: blue
      - value: 2
        color: red
    properties:
        - central_pattern: Two rows of alternating blue and red pixels, doubled in length.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The central colored pattern is expanded horizontally.
actions:
  - name: expand_pattern
    description:  The alternating sequence of blue and red pixels in the two central rows is doubled in length horizontally.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the core pattern:** Locate the two central rows in the input grid that contain the alternating sequence of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.
2.  **Double the pattern:** Horizontally double the length of the pattern in each row.
3. **Preserve Empty Rows:** rows with white pixels(0) are left unchanged.
4.  **Construct the output grid:** Create a new grid where the original two rows are replaced with new, horizontally expanded row.

Essentially the length gets multiplied by 2, and all other rows gets new pixels filled with '0'.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
