Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input grid appears to have a single horizontal line of alternating red and green pixels, while the surrounding pixels are white. The output grid seems to be an expansion of this line.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
      - dimensions: 5x7
      - colors: [0, 2, 3]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: output_grid
      - dimensions: 5x14
      - colors: [0, 2, 3]
  - type: line
    properties:
      - color_sequence: [2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2]
      - orientation: horizontal
      - row: 3
      - start_column: 1 # 0 indexed
      - end_column: 7 # exclusive

actions:
  - type: expand
    object: line
    properties:
      - factor: 2
      - direction: horizontal

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: line
  - type: corresponds_to
    from:  input_grid
    to: output_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the colored line:** Locate the single horizontal line of non-white pixels in the input grid. Note its row index, starting and ending column indices, and the sequence of colors.
2.  **Expand the line:** Duplicate the line's color pattern horizontally to the right by repeating the entire sequence.
3.  **Construct the output grid:** Create a new grid with double the width of original line, while the vertical dimension and other lines with color white (0) remains the same. Copy expanded pattern onto the output grid in the same row as the input grid.
