The output grid appears to be a combination of the original input grid, a mirrored/repeated version of it, and areas filled with 0 (white). The non-zero values from input grid seem to be preserved. Specifically, it seems there is a pattern where the initial grid is replicated and spaces of zeros are added in the pattern.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
