They seem to be related to the input grids through replication and placement, with the addition of '0' (white) as a filler. There's an apparent rotational or mirroring aspect.\n*    There are three distinct 3x3 regions in each of the output grids\n*    The filling with '0' (white) forms a distinct \"plus\" shape that separates the non-zero input patterns\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
