facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is replicated to create a larger output grid.
  - observation: |
      The replication occurs in a 2x2 pattern, creating four copies of the input.
  - property: output_grid_size
    description: The output grid dimensions are related to the input dimensions.
    calculation: Output dimension = Input dimension * 3
  - action: replicate_input
    description: The input grid is replicated four times.
  - action: position_replicas
    description: Replicas are placed in a 2x2 grid arrangement within the output.
  - observation: |
      There are no additional objects or colors introduced; only replications of the input.
