actions:
  - type: condense
    description: The input grid is condensed into a smaller output grid.
  - type: represent
    description: Specific colored regions in the input are represented in the output, potentially based on their shape, location, and color.
  - type: rearrange
    description: the positions do not directly copy, the objects are arranged

relationships:
  - input_grid contains azure_region, yellow_region, red_region, blue_region, green_region
  - output_grid represents colors and relative arrangement of regions from input_grid
