The output grid seems to be a condensed and rearranged representation of the input grid. The key elements appear to be distinct colored \"objects\" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color in the input. The output seems to capture the relative positions and colors of these objects, but in a highly abstracted form.  The output grid's size is significantly smaller than the input, and the objects' shapes are not preserved. Empty space (represented by 0) plays a crucial role in defining the boundaries of the objects and is mostly eliminated in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

Pixels are considered contiguous if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally.\n\n2. **Extract Object Colors:** For each identified object, record its color (the non-zero digit representing it).\n\n3. **Determine Bounding Box:** for each object get all colors in it's bounding box, even the empty cells.\n\n4. **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid to the combined unique colors of all bounding boxes, make it 6x6, where each color has 1 horizontal and 1 vertical line in the grid.\n\n5.  **Arrange in Order:** Arrange the colors of the objects in the output grid by checking how the object colors are laid out in the bounding boxes:\n    *   Iterate through bounding boxes from left to right and from top to bottom.\n    *   For each bounding box iterate through all of the colors from left to right and top to bottom.\n    *   Create a combined output grid as follows:\n        -   if a color is not present add it to the array of colors\n        -   Add the identified color to the output grid by looking at the index in the colors array.\n\n6. **Return the output.**\n"
