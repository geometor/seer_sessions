Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial strategy, focused on extracting colors from the corners of a bounding box and placing them in a specific pattern in a 5x5 output grid, clearly doesn't capture the underlying transformation rule. The code produces incorrect results for all examples after the first. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was overly simplistic and didn't consider the consistent structure present in all input-output pairs. The rule is not about the corners of a bounding box, but the mirroring of a line, or a partial line, of color.

The strategy to resolve the errors is first to go back to first principles, analyzing each of the input/output pairs. I will determine a simple, consistent transformation rule to explain all of them.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution Analysis):**

Here's a breakdown of the code execution results, focusing on the differences between the expected output and the transformed output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Single blue (1) pixel in the center of a larger grid.
    *   Output: 5x5 grid, two blue pixels arranged vertically, mirrored, with 3 white rows in between.
    *   Transformed Output: Matches the expected output.
    *   Objects: {1: [(5, 4)]}

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Vertical line of three red (2) pixels.
    *   Output: 5x5 grid, two columns of three red pixels, mirrored with 1 white column in between.
    *   Transformed Output: *Incorrect*. Only shows colors in the corners of the bounding box. Many differences.
    *   Objects: {2: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)]}

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Vertical line of four green (3) pixels.
    *   Output: 5x5 grid, with two columns of four green pixels, mirrored with one white column in between.
    *   Transformed Output: *Incorrect*. Shows colors in the corner of the bounding box. Many differences.
    *  Objects: {3: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)]}

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: Single azure (4) pixel at the bottom-right of a larger grid.
    *   Output: 5 x 5 grid, with two azure pixels arranged vertically, mirrored, with 3 white rows in between.
    *   Transformed Output: *Incorrect*. Does reflect the color but only in the corners of the bounding box.
    *   Objects: {4: [(9, 10)]}

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "All output grids are 5x5."
  - observation: "The output grids always exhibit a mirrored symmetry with respect to the colored pixels."
  - observation: "There is a center white column or row separating the mirror images."
  - observation: "The input always includes a vertical line of pixels, either a single pixel or many."
  - observation: "The input lines are always of the same color."
  - observation: "The lines or single pixels get duplicated on opposite sides of a central axis."
  - observation: "The lines are scaled, if necessary, in the mirrored transformation to best fit in the 5x5 output grid."
  - observation: "The axis of mirroring may be a column or a row of white pixels."
  - observation: "The length of the axis is either 1 or 3."
  - hypothesis: "The length of the axis is related to the length of the line segment."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input Line:** Find the contiguous vertical line of non-zero pixels in the input grid. If there are no such pixels return an empty 5x5 output. Note the color of the line. Note the length of the vertical line.
2.  **Determine output size and separation:** The output grid is always 5x5. If the length of the input line is 1, the white space separating the output is three rows, making the colored pixels separated by a total of 4 rows and 2 columns. If the length of the input line is greater than one, then the white space separating the mirrored lines is 1 column.
3. **Scale the Line:** Scale the input line so that the mirrored lines in the ouput will fit completely within the ouput grid.
4.  **Mirror and Create Output:** Create a 5x5 output grid. Place a copy of the (scaled) input line in the output grid, centered vertically. Then using the rule about separation, create its mirror image.

This improved natural language program provides a much more accurate and general description of the transformation. It focuses on the vertical line and its mirroring, rather than the corners of an arbitrarily defined bounding box. The added information about the line segment length and how it's transformed is also critical to creating a correct output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
