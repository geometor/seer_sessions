Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Find the intersecting points of the orange, blue, yellow and magenta lines.
2.  **Bounding Box:** Create a bounding box. The top of the box is defined by orange line. The bottom of the box defined by the blue line. The left is define by the yellow line. The right is define by the magenta line.
3.  **Include Azure:** Include the azure shape within this bounding box. If azure pixels fall on the border, include them.
4.  **Extract Subgrid**: Extract new grid formed by the bounding box, from the original grid.
5.  **Output subgrid:** Select the subgrid including azure.
6. **Reduce**: Create output, collapsing the extracted subgrid by removing 0 value columns from sides.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
