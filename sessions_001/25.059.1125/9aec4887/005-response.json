            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the tests and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code works correctly for the first training example but fails on others. The primary issue seems to be the hardcoded placement of the azure object and the assumption that it always has the same shape. The other colors (red, blue, green) are placed correctly based on relative positioning, which is a good approach. However, the yellow object at the top is also static. The strategy will involve making the azure object placement dynamic and dependent on tracing its actual shape in the input grid. The yellow and green positioning should be reviewed.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, including a comparison of expected vs. actual output using the provided code:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A larger grid with azure, yellow, red, blue, and green regions.\n*   **Expected Output:** 6x6 grid with specific arrangements of these colors.\n*   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.\n*   **Observations:** The initial code was designed based on this example, so it succeeds.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** Different arrangement of the same colors.\n*   **Expected Output:** 6x6 grid reflecting the new arrangement.\n*    **Diff vs expected:**\n```diff\n--- a/expected_output\n+++ b/actual_output\n@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@\n 044440\n-080080\n-288881\n-288881\n-200081\n+080080\n+280801\n+208001\n+200081\n 033330\n```\n*   **Observations:** The azure object is incorrectly placed. The hardcoded coordinates in `transform()` don't match the shape in this input.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:** Yet another arrangement.\n*    **Expected Output:** 6x6 grid per the pattern.\n*   **Diff vs expected:**\n```diff\n--- a/expected_output\n+++ b/actual_output\n@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@\n 044440\n-880000\n-888882\n-088882\n-080002\n+080080\n+280801\n+208001\n+200081\n 033330\n```\n*   **Observations:** Similar to Example 2, the azure object's placement is incorrect due to the hardcoded coordinates and the assumption of shape. The placement of red and blue depends on the azure, and is also incorrect.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: irregular\n        position: varies\n      - color: yellow (4)\n        shape: horizontal line\n        position: top row\n      - color: red (2)\n        shape: vertical line\n        position: left\n      - color: blue (1)\n        shape: vertical line\n        position: right\n      - color: green (3)\n        shape: horizontal line\n        position: bottom row\n    actions:\n      - outline: azure (8)\n      - place: yellow (4), top\n      - place: red (2), left of azure\n      - place: blue (1), right of azure\n      - place: green (3), bottom\n      - fill: zeros (0), corners and empty spaces\n\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: irregular\n        position: varies\n      - color: yellow (4)\n        shape: horizontal line\n        position: top row\n      - color: red (2)\n        shape: vertical line\n        position: left\n      - color: blue (1)\n        shape: vertical line\n        position: right\n      - color: green (3)\n        shape: horizontal line\n        position: bottom row\n    actions:\n      - outline: azure (8)\n      - place: yellow (4), top\n      - place: red (2), left of azure\n      - place: blue (1), right of azure\n      - place: green (3), bottom\n      - fill: zeros (0), corners and empty spaces\n\n  - example_id: 3\n    objects:\n      - color: azure (8)\n        shape: irregular\n        position: varies\n      - color: yellow (4)\n        shape: horizontal line\n        position: top row\n      - color: red (2)\n        shape: vertical line\n        position: left\n      - color: blue (1)\n        shape: vertical line\n        position: right\n      - color: green (3)\n        shape: horizontal line\n        position: bottom row\n    actions:\n      - outline: azure (8)\n      - place: yellow (4), top\n      - place: red (2), left of azure\n      - place: blue (1), right of azure\n      - place: green (3), bottom\n      - fill: zeros (0), corners and empty spaces\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8), yellow (4), red (2), blue (1), and green (3) within the input grid.\n\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 6x6 output grid filled with zeros.\n\n3.  **Place Yellow:** Place a horizontal line of yellow (4) pixels across the top row of the output grid, leaving one empty cell (0) at each end.\n\n4.  **Outline Azure:** Trace the outline of the azure (8) object in the input grid. Start from the top-leftmost pixel of the azure object. Proceed clockwise around the *outer* boundary of the azure shape, placing an 8 in the corresponding cell in the output grid. *Do not* trace internal connections within the azure shape. *Skip* any azure pixels that do not form part of the outer boundary.\n\n5.  **Place Red:** Place a vertical line of red (2) pixels in the leftmost column of the output grid. The red line should extend from the second row to the second-to-last row.\n\n6.  **Place Blue:** Place a vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the rightmost column of the output grid. The blue line should extend from the second row to the second-to-last row.\n\n7.  **Place Green:** Place a horizontal line of green (3) pixels across the bottom row of the output grid, leaving one empty cell (0) at each end.\n\n8.  **Fill Remaining:** Ensure that the corner cells and any other cells not occupied by the placed objects are filled with zeros (0).\n"
