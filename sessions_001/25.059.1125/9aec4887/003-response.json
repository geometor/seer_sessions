The output grid seems to be a condensed and rearranged representation of certain color patterns within the input grid. There appear to be distinct objects or regions of color in the input that are somehow summarized or represented in the output. The colors in the output are present in the input, and it is likely that their positioning in the input grid influences their presence and position in the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
