facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: zero values represent empty/background cells
  - observation: non-zero values are replicated
  - relationship: replication is based on the positions of non-zero values in the input. The output is the input with an extra row containing the non-zero values from the input, located directly underneath the existing non-zero value row.
