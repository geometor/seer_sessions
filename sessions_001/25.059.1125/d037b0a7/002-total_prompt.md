**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing a color. The transformation seems to involve replicating certain non-zero values within the grid. The key seems to be the relationship between the non-zero numbers. Zero values act like empty or background cells.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: zero values represent empty/background cells
  - observation: non-zero values are replicated
  - relationship: replication is based on the positions of non-zero values in the input. The output is the input with an extra row containing the non-zero values from the input, located directly underneath the existing non-zero value row.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Rows:** Iterate through the input grid, row by row. Identify rows that contain at least one non-zero value.
2. **Identify position of non-zero values**: In a non-zero row, identify all columns with non-zero values.
3. **Replicate Non-Zero value**: Copy the values in these columns to the row immediately underneath. If a value already exists, overwrite it.

In summary, the transformation identifies rows containing non-zero values and, for those row, non-zero values are replicated to the next row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
