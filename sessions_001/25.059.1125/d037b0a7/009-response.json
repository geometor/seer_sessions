The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a distinct color. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid. The key change appears to be a replication or filling of certain colored regions based on other colored cells, and the empty white cells (0) remain unchanged. It is likely a combination of object and geometric transformations.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
