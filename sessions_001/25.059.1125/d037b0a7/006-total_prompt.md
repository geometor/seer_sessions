Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Preserve Non-White:** Iterate through the input grid. If a pixel is not white (0), keep its value unchanged in the corresponding position of the output grid.
2.  **Propagate Magenta and Yellow:** For each white (0) pixel in the input grid:
    *   Check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). Diagonal is not considered to be adjacent.
    *   If any neighbor is magenta (6), change the white pixel to magenta (6) in the output grid.
    *    If any neighbor is yellow (4), change the white pixel to yellow(4) in the output grid.
3. **Fill Remaining:** In this example, there are no remaining white cells. If white cells had remained, those would stay white.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine our natural language program and observations accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were a good starting point, focusing on propagating magenta and yellow from existing pixels to adjacent white pixels. However, the results across multiple training examples reveal that the rule isn't universally applicable and needs refinement. The core issue is that the initial program only accounts for a *subset* of the transformation logic. It correctly identifies the propagation of color, but it seems there are specific conditions that were missed.

My strategy is:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input/output/prediction triplet, focusing on *where* the prediction matches the expected output and, more importantly, where it *doesn't*. This includes identifying specific pixel values, locations, and neighborhoods.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, adjust the natural language program to encompass the observed behavior. This might involve adding conditions, changing the order of operations, or recognizing entirely new aspects of the transformation.
3.  **Object and Action Identification:** Use the analysis to update the YAML section, being precise about what objects exist (e.g., "magenta regions," "yellow regions") and the transformations they undergo.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Specific Example Analysis**

I need to understand precisely *what* differed between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. I will construct a numpy comparison.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(predicted_grid, output_grid):
    """Compares two grids and returns a grid showing the differences."""
    comparison_grid = np.where(predicted_grid == output_grid, -1, output_grid) # -1 for match, output value where mismatch
    return comparison_grid

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Starting Points:** Locate all non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "seed" pixels for the transformation.
2.  **Vertical Expansion (Yellow):** If a seed pixel is yellow (4), and there are adjacent white pixels *vertically*, change those adjacent white cells to yellow. This expansion is only one step.
3.  **Horizontal Expansion (Magenta):** If a seed pixel is magenta (6), change all adjacent white pixels to its *right* to magenta. Stop horizontal expansion when a non-white cell or the edge of the grid is encountered.
4. **Vertical and Horizontal Expansion(Magenta in top-left corner):** If magenta(6) appears at the top-left corner (0,0), it will propagate vertically down.
5. **Preserve other colors:** All other colors will be preserved.

**Key Changes and Observations**

*   **Directionality:** The original program assumed propagation in all directions. The examples demonstrate that yellow expands vertically and magenta expands *primarily* horizontally to the right, with a special case when magenta starts in the top-left.
*   **Stopping Condition:** The horizontal expansion of magenta has a clear stopping condition (non-white pixel or grid edge).
* **Seed Pixels**: Expansion starts from the non-white pixels.
* **Special Case**: Magenta in the top-left expands in both vertically and horizontally.
*   **Independence:** The yellow and magenta expansions appear to be independent processes. One doesn't trigger the other.

This revised natural language program, along with the detailed YAML facts and the code execution results, should provide a much stronger basis for generating the correct Python code. The key improvements are the explicit directionality of expansion, the stopping conditions, and the identification of "seed" pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
