Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grids:** Both input and output are 15x15 grids.\n*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, including white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and orange (7).\n*   **Objects:** Groups of contiguous pixels of the same non-white color can be considered objects.\n*   **Movement/Shifts:** It appears some colored pixels have shifted positions, while others have disappeared.\n*   **Relative Positioning:** The spatial arrangement of the colored pixels seems important.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

The configurations (internal arrangement) of the green and orange objects is maintained, and the final positions are defined in relative positions.\n\n"
