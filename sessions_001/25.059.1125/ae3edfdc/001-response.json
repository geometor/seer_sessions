Here's my analysis:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors. The primary elements appear to be colored \"objects\" formed by contiguous pixels of the same non-zero color. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement or \"infilling\" of these objects. The background is consistently color 0 (white) in both input and output. The shape of the objects in the output resembles a plus (+) sign in all of the examples.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Use input object's color for the \"+\" object.\n    *   The central pixel of the \"+\" is the calculated center.\n    *   Extend one pixel up, down, left, and right from the center pixel, creating the arms of the \"+\".\n4. All other cells that aren't filled remain color 0.\n\nThe transformation rule essentially replaces each distinct colored object in the input with a \"+\" shaped object of the same color, centered approximately where the original object was located.
