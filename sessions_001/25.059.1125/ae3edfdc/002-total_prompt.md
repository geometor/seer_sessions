<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3008x2000 at 0x7F4C2318BB50>Okay, I've reviewed the input-output pairs for the three training examples. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors. The primary elements appear to be colored "objects" formed by contiguous pixels of the same non-zero color. The transformation seems to involve a re-arrangement or "infilling" of these objects. The background is consistently color 0 (white) in both input and output. The shape of the objects in the output resembles a plus (+) sign in all of the examples.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: colored_object
    properties:
      - color: integer (1-9)
      - shape: irregular initially, "+" in output.
      - location: (row, column) coordinates
      - contiguity: pixels of the same color forming a connected component.
actions:
  - name: infill
    description: Fills pixels around and including the original object's pixels to create a "+" shape.
    parameters:
      - color: color of the object being infilled.
      - center: approximate center of the original object.
relationships:
  - input_objects: Colored objects present in the input grid.
  - output_objects: "+" shaped objects present in the output grid.
  - spatial:  The output objects are centered around the approximate center of the corresponding input object. The color of the output object is determined by input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous, non-zero colored objects in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Center:** For each identified object, estimate its "center". The center will be considered the average coordinates of all the pixels making up the shape.
3.  **Infill to "+":** Create a "+" shaped object in the output grid, centered at the coordinates determined in step 2. Use input object's color for the "+" object.
    *   The central pixel of the "+" is the calculated center.
    *   Extend one pixel up, down, left, and right from the center pixel, creating the arms of the "+".
4. All other cells that aren't filled remain color 0.

The transformation rule essentially replaces each distinct colored object in the input with a "+" shaped object of the same color, centered approximately where the original object was located. The background (color 0) remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
