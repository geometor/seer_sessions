            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and overall approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on observations from the first training example and correctly identified the movement of the green (3) and cross-shaped orange(7)/blue(1) clusters. However, it made assumptions that do not hold true for all examples. Specifically, it assumed that:\n\n1.  Only one green cluster would exist.\n2.  A green cell is placed two positions to the right of *any* 2 value after the main green cluster has moved.\n3.  All orange/blue crosses will behave identically.\n4.  Clusters that were not part of the explicitly handled green or orange/blue logic should not move from their original positions.\n\nThe test results across all training examples reveal that these assumptions are incorrect. The updated strategy is as follows:\n\n1.  **Generalize Cluster Handling:** Instead of hardcoding the behavior for specific colors, detect cluster *types* and apply transformations based on properties like shape, not only color.\n2.  **Contextualize Transformations:** The placement of new pixels or the movement of existing ones is dependent on the surrounding context, not just the color. Examine adjacent cells.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated logic after each example, further refining the rules based on the observed discrepancies.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using `code_execution` to validate)**\n\nI'll use print statements to inspect the intermediate `output_grid` after each main step (green cluster movement, cross movement, other cluster handling) to understand where deviations occur. Since I do not have iterative `code_execution` I will be inspecting grids manually.\n\n*Example 0 (Correct):*\n- Green cluster moves down-left; a new green cell is correctly placed.\n- Orange/blue cross moves up.\n- Result: Correct.\n\n*Example 1 (Incorrect):*\n- Two green clusters exist.\n- Green clusters do not combine.\n- Result: Incorrect placement of additional green cell after moving first green cluster\n\n*Example 2 (Incorrect):*\n- a green cluster moves down-left.\n- a new green cell is placed correctly to the right.\n- There is an orange/blue/orange T shape, instead of a cross shape. It does not appear to move.\n- Result: Incorrect - the T did not move, but other parts moved incorrectly.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nexample_0:\n  objects:\n    - type: cluster\n      color: green\n      shape: irregular\n      initial_position: (0, 2)\n      action: move_down_left\n      new_pixel:\n          color: green\n          relative_position: right_of_red\n\n    - type: cluster\n      color: [orange, blue, orange]\n      shape: cross\n      initial_position: (2, 6)\n      action: move_up\n\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    - type: cluster\n      color: green\n      shape: irregular\n      initial_position: (0, 5)\n      action: move_down_left\n      new_pixel:\n        color: green\n        relative_position: right_of_red\n\n    - type: cluster\n      color: green\n      shape: irregular\n      initial_position: (3, 1)\n      action: move_down_left\n      new_pixel:\n        color: green\n        relative_position: right_of_red\n\nexample_2:\n  objects:\n    - type: cluster\n      color: green\n      shape: irregular\n      initial_position: (1, 3)\n      action: move_down_left\n      new_pixel:\n          color: green\n          relative_position: right_of_red\n\n    - type: cluster\n      color: [orange, blue, orange]\n      shape: T\n      initial_position: (4, 6)\n      action: none\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find Clusters:** Identify all contiguous clusters of non-zero pixels.\n2.  **Green Cluster Rule:**\n    *   For each green (3) cluster:\n        *   Move the entire cluster down one row and left one column.\n        *   Find red (2) pixels that were part of the moved green cluster.\n        *   Place a new green (3) pixel one cell to the *right* of each of those red pixels, if that position is within the grid boundaries.\n\n3. **Cross Shaped Cluster Rule:** If a cluster is a cross-shape made of orange(7) and blue(1) cells, move the whole cluster up one row.\n4. **T Shaped Cluster:** If a cluster is a \"T\" shape made of orange(7) and blue(1), do not move.\n5. **Other clusters**: Clusters that don't match either of the rules above are ignored.\n\nKey improvements in the natural language program:\n\n*   Explicitly handles multiple green clusters.\n*   Clarifies the relative placement of the new green pixel (adjacent to red pixels that were *part* of moved green cluster).\n*   Introduces logic for T-shaped clusters.\n*   Includes a rule to avoid changing other shapes.\n"
