Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grids:** Both input and output are 15x15 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, including white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and orange (7).
*   **Objects:** Groups of contiguous pixels of the same non-white color can be considered objects.
*   **Movement/Shifts:** It appears some colored pixels have shifted positions, while others have disappeared.
*   **Relative Positioning:** The spatial arrangement of the colored pixels seems important.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 15x15
    input_objects:
        - color: green
          positions: [[0,6],[11,14],[14,6]]
        - color: orange
          positions: [[6,1],[14,10]]
        - color: blue
          positions:  [[6,10]]
        - color: red
          positions: [[11,6]]

    output_objects:
        - color: green
          positions: [[10,6],[11,7],[12,6]]
        - color: orange
          positions: [[6,9],[7,10]]
        - color: blue
          positions:  [[6,10]]
        - color: red
          positions: [[11,6]]

  - action: shift
    description: objects move to new positions
  - relation: object_arrangement
    description: the relative position of the non-white pixels to each other.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-white pixels (objects) within the input grid.
2.  **Observe original object locations:** Note the specific row and column of each object.
3.  **Orange Object Transformation:** The two orange (7) pixels seem to form a vertical line or be stacked vertically.
   *   The relative position of orange objects, it seems that the orange pixels move such as to be adjacent to the blue pixel and on its left, keeping its configuration
4.  **Green Object Transformation:** The three green (3) pixels seem to form a sort of angled or bent line.
    *   The green pixels re-arrange around the red pixel. Maintaining same vertical ordering.
5. **Blue Object Transformation:**.
    *   The blue object does not move.
6.  **Red Object Transformation:**.
    *   The red object does not move.
7.  **Preserve relative configuration**: The relative position, and count of colored pixels are preserved, except some may be removed if out of bounds.

In essence, the program identifies colored objects, and it seems that the orange and green objects reorganize around the blue and red objects, which act like fixed points. The configurations (internal arrangement) of the green and orange objects is maintained, and the final positions are defined in relative positions.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
