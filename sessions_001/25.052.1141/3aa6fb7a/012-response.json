It also adds a blue cell at (5,4), when there should be one at (5,3)\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify 2x1 Vertical Azure Rectangles:** Scan the input grid to locate all 2x1 vertical rectangles composed of azure (8) colored cells. A 2x1 vertical rectangle is defined as two vertically adjacent cells of the same color.\n2.  **Place Blue Cell:** For each identified 2x1 azure rectangle, place a single blue (1) colored cell immediately to the right of the *top* azure cell of the rectangle.\n3. **Boundary Condition**: Make sure the added blue cell is still within boundaries.\n\n**Explanation of the changes**\n\nThe previous description, while mostly correct was not *precise* enough. I missed to highlight to only use the *top* cell.\nThe examples show that only 2x1 azure vertical rectangles are considered.\n"
