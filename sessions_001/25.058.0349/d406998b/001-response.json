            "text": "Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe task involves a grid of colored pixels, where each number represents a specific color. The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The primary change seems to be the selective replacement of certain colors (represented by numbers) with other colors. Specifically, some of the '5' (gray) pixels are replaced by '3' (green) pixels, while others remain unchanged, and the '0' (white) remain the same. The placement of the altered pixels doesn't seem random, it seems to happen on a subset of the 5's. It appears to happen when 5 is adjacent to 0 in at least two directions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
