            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were based on observations from the first training example. While it worked correctly for the first example, it failed on the second and third. This indicates that the initial program was too specific and didn't capture the general rule underlying the transformation. The code hard-coded the positions where changes should be made.  We need to find a more general, relationship-based rule, rather than assuming fixed positions. The results on all three examples are essential.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the input and output grids for *all* training examples, along with the code execution results. Identify where the code's assumptions break down.\n2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for consistent relationships or patterns across all examples. Focus on relative positions of changed pixels, rather than absolute coordinates. Pay close attention to \"adjacency\" and \"connectivity\".\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rephrase the natural language program to describe the general rule, avoiding hardcoded indices. Describe the logic of locating relevant pixels.\n4. Create YAML and a new natural language program\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including the results of code execution:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 5]\n     [0 0 0 0 5 5]\n     [0 5 5 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 3]\n     [0 0 0 0 5 3]\n     [0 3 3 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Actual Output (from code):**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 3]\n     [0 0 0 0 5 3]\n     [0 3 3 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Result:** Success. The code correctly transformed the input.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [5 0 0 0 5 0]\n     [0 5 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 5 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [3 0 0 0 3 0]\n     [0 3 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 3 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Actual Output (from code):**\n    ```\n    [[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n     [3 0 0 0 5 0]\n     [0 3 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 3 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Result:** Partial Failure. Only some of the gray pixels were correctly transformed to green. The gray pixel at \\[1,4] was not transformed\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n     [[0 5 0 0 0 0]\n      [0 5 0 0 0 0]\n      [0 0 0 0 0 5]\n      [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Expected Output:**\n    ```\n    [[0 3 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 3 0 0 0 0]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 3]\n     [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Actual Output (from code):**\n    ```\n     [[0 5 0 0 0 0]\n      [0 3 0 0 0 0]\n      [0 0 0 0 0 5]\n      [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n    ```\n*   **Result:** Failure. Several of the expected changes were not made. The gray pixel at \\[0,1] should have become green, but it did not.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - description: gray pixels\n    color: 5\n    properties:\n      - can_change_color: true\n  - description: green pixels\n    color: 3\n    properties:\n      - source: gray pixels\n\nactions:\n  - name: change_color\n    agent: gray pixels\n    target: green pixels\n    conditions:\n      - description: \"Adjacent gray pixels in a line are transformed to green.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nIterate through the input grid. Identify all gray (5) pixels. Determine groups of adjacent gray pixels that form a continuous line (horizontal or vertical). Convert all gray pixels in such lines to green (3). All other pixels remain unchanged.\n"
