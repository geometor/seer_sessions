The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), and green (3). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x14). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some gray (5) pixels to green (3) based on their position. There is a structure or pattern that is partially kept.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
