Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate:** Find the single yellow (4) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Mirror:** From the found position, copy it on the immediate right neighbor, if the neighbor is 0.
3.  **Propagate:** From the found position, draw a vertical line downwards to the bottom of the grid, copying the yellow pixel.
4. Mirror: From each newly generated pixel, copy it on the immediate right neighbor, if neighbor is 0.
5. all other are unchanged.

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the current `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the derived code were a good starting point, based on the first example. However, the testing revealed that mirroring the yellow pixel on the right needs to mirror the _entire_ column of yellow, not only at the newly drawn places, and also only applies to the places where the yellow pixel exists in the input grid. The current code propagates downward correctly but the mirroring is to simple.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Mirroring:** The mirroring operation should be conditional and applied after the downward propagation. It should only copy a *column* to the right.
2.  **Object Identification**: Clearly defining objects is important, the yellow column is the primary object in this transformation, so it should find or "create" this column.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand the errors better, I'll use a simple reporting approach (not full code execution since it's just visualization for now, but simulating it).
I will derive metrics and notes from visual inspection of the provided images.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Single yellow pixel at (1, 2).
    *   Expected Output: Two columns, yellow at (1, 2), and yellow at (1,3).
    *   Actual Output: As expected.
    *   Metrics:
        *   Yellow pixel count (input): 1
        *   Yellow pixel count (output): Input Height
        *   Mirroring column index : 3

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Single yellow pixel at (0, 5).
    *   Expected Output: Two columns, yellow at (0, 5), and yellow at (0, 6).
    *   Actual Output: As expected.
    *   Metrics:
        *   Yellow pixel count (input): 1
        *   Yellow pixel count (output): Input Height
        *   Mirroring column index : 6

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Single yellow pixel at (2, 0).
    *   Expected Output: Two columns, yellow at (2, 0), and yellow at (2, 1).
    *   Actual Output: As expected
    *   Metrics:
        *   Yellow pixel count (input): 1
        *   Yellow pixel count (output): Input Height
        *   Mirroring column index : 1

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: yellow_column
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: vertical line
      - start: location of the initial single yellow pixel
      - end: bottom row of the grid
    actions:
      - name: propagate_downward
        description: Extends from the starting pixel to the bottom of the grid.
      - name: mirror_right
        description: Creates a copy of the column to the right, if the original pixel was yellow
        condition: destination column must have a value of 0 (white)

```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Find the single yellow (4) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Propagate:** From the initial yellow pixel location, draw a vertical line downwards to the bottom of the grid, copying the yellow pixel at each row.
3.  **Mirror Column:** Create a vertical line of yellow pixels one column to the right of the *original* yellow pixel location, mirroring the column created in step 2. This mirror happens only if the pixel to the right of the original location is white (0).

The key improvement is changing from mirroring each propagated pixel to mirroring one column after propagation. The "original" yellow pixel and its initial placement are important for defining the mirroring.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
