Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies '2' and '8' values in the first row of the input grid.  It replicates these values in the same columns in the output grid, but only in the second row (index 1). The rest of the cells in the output are filled with zeros. The first row of the output is a copy of the input's first row.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with zeros
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Copy the first row from input to output
    output_grid[0, :] = input_grid[0, :]

    # Iterate through the first row to find source cells (2 and 8)
    for j in range(cols):

            source_value = input_grid[0, j]

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
