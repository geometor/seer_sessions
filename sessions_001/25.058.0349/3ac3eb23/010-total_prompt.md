Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate:** Find the single yellow (4) pixel in the input grid.
2. **Mirror:** From the found position, copy it on the immediate right neighbor, if the neighbor is 0.
3.  **Propagate:** From the found position, draw a vertical line downwards to the bottom of the grid.
4.  **Alternate:** The vertical line alternates between yellow (4) and white (0) pixels.
5. Mirror: From each newly generated pixel, copy it on the immediate right neighbor, if neighbor is 0.
6. all other are unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved finding a yellow pixel, mirroring it, and drawing a vertical alternating line downwards. The provided results indicate that this program works correctly for the first training example but fails on some (or all) of the subsequent examples. This is expected, as the initial program was tailored to the single case.  We need a more general rule. The primary strategy is to revise the natural language program to correctly generalize across all training examples. The code produced was based on the first example, which includes mirroring and alternating colours. Examining the other training samples, we can see if these initial assumptions were correct.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the errors, I'll analyze each example pair, checking the results against predicted output. Let use code to give insight on each.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def report(grid):
    print(f"Shape: {grid.shape}")
    print(f"Unique values: {np.unique(grid)}")
    # count each unique value
    for i in np.unique(grid):
        print(f"Count of {i}: {np.count_nonzero(grid == i)}")

  for pair in task['train']:
    input_grid = np.array(pair['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(pair['output'])
    print("Input")
    report(input_grid)
    print("Output")
    report(output_grid)
    print("---")
    predicted_grid = transform(input_grid)
    print("Predicted")
    report(predicted_grid)
    print("Equal:", np.array_equal(predicted_grid, output_grid))
    print("==========")

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
