## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 6 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x76911E9723F0>

**output:**
```
2 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 2 1
0 0 1 1 1
0 6 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and attempt to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 5x5 grid with numerical values representing colors (0-9). Most cells are '0' (white), but there are two '2' (red) cells and one '6' (magenta) cell.
*   **Output Grid:** A 5x5 grid, seemingly derived from the input. The '2' (red) cells remain in the same positions. The '6' (magenta) cell also stays in place. The notable change is the appearance of '1' (blue) cells in the top-right 3x3 section of output and other cells' values are changed to 0.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 5x5 2D array of integers
    properties:
      - dimensions: [5, 5]
      - values: [0-9] # representing colors

  - object: cell
    description: individual element within the grid
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            1: blue
            2: red
            6: magenta
      - position: [row, column]

  - observation: color_preservation
    description: Cells with initial values of 2 and 6 retain their color and position in the output grid.

  - observation: color_change_region
    description: A rectangular region in the top-right corner of the input grid, bounded by the red cells, changes some cell's color to blue (1) in the output grid. The other cells in the input grid are changed to 0.

  - action: fill_region
      description: the region between two '2' is filled with '1'. The other area is filled with '0' except the cell '6'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Key Cells:** Identify the positions of cells with the value '2' (red) and '6' (magenta) within the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Key Cells:** Maintain the color and position of the identified '2' and '6' cells in the output grid.
3. **Determine Top region**: find the min row and min col that has color '2', use this to find the range.
4.  **Fill with Blue (1):** Change the color of the cells in the region bounded by \[min\_row, min\_col] to the value '1' (blue), inclusive. Other cells' values are set to 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
