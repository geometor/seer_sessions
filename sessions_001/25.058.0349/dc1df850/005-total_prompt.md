Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Cells:** Find all red (2) and magenta (6) cells in the input grid.
2.  **Check for Both Colors:** If *both* red and magenta cells are present, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, the output is identical to the input (no transformation).
3.  **Bounding Rectangle:** If both colors are present, determine the bounding rectangle. This rectangle is defined by the minimum row, minimum column, maximum row, and maximum column considering the positions of *both* red and magenta cells. In other words:
    *   `min_row = min(min(red_rows), min(magenta_rows))`
    *   `min_col = min(min(red_cols), min(magenta_cols))`
    *   `max_row = max(max(red_rows), max(magenta_rows))`
    *   `max_col = max(max(red_cols), max(magenta_cols))`
4.  **Fill Rectangle:** Within the output grid (initially all zeros), set all cells *inside* the bounding rectangle to blue (1).
5.  **Preserve Markers:** Copy the original red (2) and magenta (6) cells from the input grid to their exact same positions in the output grid. This ensures these boundary markers are preserved on top of the blue fill.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
