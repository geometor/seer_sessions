Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input Grid:** A 5x5 grid with numerical values representing colors (0-9). Most cells are '0' (white), but there are two '2' (red) cells and one '6' (magenta) cell.\n*   **Output Grid:** A 5x5 grid, seemingly derived from the input. The '2' (red) cells remain in the same positions. The '6' (magenta) cell also stays in place. The notable change is the appearance of '1' (blue) cells in the top-right 3x3 section of output and other cells' values are changed to 0.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
