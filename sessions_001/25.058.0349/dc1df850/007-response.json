The input grid contains isolated pixels of various colors (red, green, azure, and mostly black/background). The output grid seems to expand or \"highlight\" some of these colored pixels, particularly around a specific shape. The most notable change is an area of blue pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
