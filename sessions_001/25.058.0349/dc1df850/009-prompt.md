Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all pixels in the input grid that are not black (color 0).
2.  **Check** for a red (color 2) pixel in the top row.
3.  **If Found:** Create a blue (color value 1) pixel to the left of this pixel.
4. **Check** if the colored pixels are the red (2) pixel.
5.  **If Found:** create a 3x3 square of blue (color 1) pixels. The red pixel will not be a the center. The red pixel becomes part of the blue square. Place the red pixel at the center of the top edge of the square.
6. **Retain** other colored pixels and black background pixels as same location.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
