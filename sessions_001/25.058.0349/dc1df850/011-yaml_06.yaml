observations:
  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: red
            positions: [(1, 7), (9, 9)]
            count: 2
      output:
        objects:
          - color: blue
            shape: 3x3 square
            positions: [top-left corner: (1, 7)]
            count: 1
        notes: "One red pixel becomes the top-center of the blue square. The other is consumed by the blue square."
  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: red
            positions: [(2, 4), (7, 1)]
            count: 2
      output:
        objects:
          - color: blue
            shape: 3x3 square
            positions: [(1,4), (7,1)] # top-left corner of each square
            count: 2
        notes: "Each red pixel becomes the top-center of a blue square."
  - example_3:
      input:
          objects:
            - color: red
              positions:  [(0, 0), (4, 6)]
              count: 2
      output:
        objects:
          - color: blue
            shape: 3x3 square
            positions:  [(4,6)] # top-left corner
          - color: blue
            positions: [(0,-1)] # this is out of bounds and won't be drawn
            count: 1
        notes: "Red pixel becomes top-center of blue square.  Top row red pixel has special behavior (attempted out-of-bounds write to the left)."
