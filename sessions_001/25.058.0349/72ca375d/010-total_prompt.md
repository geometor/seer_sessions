Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to identify and extract a 2x2 yellow square. This worked perfectly for the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the rule is more specific: the target object contains a 2x2 block of yellow and the output extracts that block.

The core issue is that we added an assumption in the original program - that
there would only be ONE 2x2 square.

The strategy to resolve this will involve relaxing that constraint, and making
the program general to finding ALL 2x2 objects.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, the code's output, and whether it matched the expected output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid with a single 2x2 yellow square.
    *   Expected Output: 2x2 yellow square.
    *   Actual Output: 2x2 yellow square.
    *   Match: Yes.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 11x11 grid with two distinct 2x2 yellow squares.
    *   Expected Output: 2x2 yellow square
    *   Actual Output: One of the 2x2 squares.
    *   Match: Yes.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 15x15 grid.  A 2x2 yellow square.  Multiple other yellow
        objects, single and some with sizes larger than 4 pixels, but only
        one of them.
    *   Expected Output: 2x2 yellow square.
    *   Actual Output: 2x2 yellow square.
    *   Match: Yes

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_grid_size: 9x9
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: 2x2 square
          count: 1
      output_grid_size: 2x2
      transformation: extract 2x2 square

  - example_2:
      input_grid_size: 11x11
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: 2x2 square
          count: 2
      output_grid_size: 2x2
      transformation: extract one of the 2x2 square

  - example_3:
      input_grid_size: 15x15
      objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: 2x2 square
          count: 1
        - color: yellow
          shape: other
          count: multiple
      output_grid_size: 2x2
      transformation: extract 2x2 square

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Identify all 2x2 yellow squares in the input grid.
2.  Select any one of the 2x2 square.
3.  Extract the selected 2x2 yellow square object.
4.  The extracted square object becomes the output grid. All other regions are discarded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
