The input grid contains various colored squares (represented by numbers 0-9). The output grid seems to be a highly condensed version of the input, focusing on a specific color (magenta/6) and potentially its spatial arrangement. Other colors and the background (white/0) are seemingly ignored.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
