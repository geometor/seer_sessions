facts:
  - example_1:
      input: |
        A 9x9 grid.  Most pixels are gray (5).
        A contiguous block of magenta (6) pixels exists in the lower right.
      output: |
        A 1x4 grid.
        All pixels are magenta (6).
      transformation:  Select the smallest, contiguous block of magenta pixels.
      success: True

  - example_2:
      input: |
        A 9x9 grid. Most pixels are black (0).
        A block of gray (5) pixels is in the center.
        A single magenta (6) pixel is in the bottom right corner.
      output: |
        A 1x1 grid.
        The pixel is magenta (6).
      transformation: Select the smallest, contiguous block of magenta pixels
      success: True
