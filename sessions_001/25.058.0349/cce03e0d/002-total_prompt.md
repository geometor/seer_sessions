## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 0 0
2 1 0
0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911EBFDB30>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x76911EBFDBD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. The most obvious change is an expansion of the grid's dimensions. The colors in the input grid (represented by digits 0, 1, and 2) seem to be preserved in the expanded output grid, but their positions are relative to the original dimensions of the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Grid expansion. The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 9x9.
  - observation: Color preservation. Colors 0, 1, and 2 from the input appear in the output.
  - observation: Position mapping. The input grid's top-left cell (0,0) corresponds to the output grid's cell (3,0).  The x dimension is multiplied by 3.
  - observation: Blank padding: The expanded output grid has all cells except the original pixels initialized with zeros.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 1, 2]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      colors: [0, 1, 2]
  - relationship: output_grid is an expanded version of input_grid
  - action: expansion
    details: multiplying both dimensions by 3.
  - action: color_mapping
    details: transferring the color from input_grid to the expanded cells of the output_grid
  - action: padding
    details: default color is set to 0 in empty cells
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Expand the Grid:** Take the input grid (3x3) and expand its dimensions by a factor of 3, creating a new 9x9 grid.

2. **Initialize Padding:** Initialize all cells in the new 9x9 grid to color 0 (white/background).

3. **Map Colors:** Iterate through each cell in the original 3x3 input grid. For each cell:
   - Multiply the row index by 3.
   - Multiply the column index by 3.
   - Copy the color value from the input grid cell to the corresponding cell in the output grid at calculated row, col.

In essence, the program takes each pixel in the input and places it in the top-left corner of a 3x3 sub-grid within the larger output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
