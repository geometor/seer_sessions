facts:
  - observation: Grid expansion. The input grid is 3x3, and the output grid is 9x9.
  - observation: Color preservation. Colors 0, 1, and 2 from the input appear in the output.
  - observation: Position mapping. The input grid's top-left cell (0,0) corresponds to the output grid's cell (3,0).  The x dimension is multiplied by 3.
  - observation: Blank padding: The expanded output grid has all cells except the original pixels initialized with zeros.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 1, 2]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 9x9
      colors: [0, 1, 2]
  - relationship: output_grid is an expanded version of input_grid
  - action: expansion
    details: multiplying both dimensions by 3.
  - action: color_mapping
    details: transferring the color from input_grid to the expanded cells of the output_grid
  - action: padding
    details: default color is set to 0 in empty cells
