The input grid contains single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input, with the original input grid replicated in specific locations within the larger grid. Specifically two copies, one at the top right and one at the bottom left. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros (white).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
