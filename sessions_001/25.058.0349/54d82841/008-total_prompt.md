## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 3 3 3 0
0 3 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x76911EE1F750>

**output:**
```
0 3 3 3 0
0 3 0 3 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 4 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x76913725D450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 5x5 grids.
*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), green (3), and yellow (4).
*   **Shapes:** There's a distinct shape formed by the green (3) pixels in the input.
*   **Change:** A single white (0) pixel in the input changes to yellow (4) in the output. The location seems significant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: [5, 5]
    elements: pixels

  - id: green_shape
    type: object
    color: green
    value: 3
    initial_coordinates: [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,1], [1,3]]

  - id: changed_pixel
    type: pixel
    initial_color: white
    initial_value: 0
    final_color: yellow
    final_value: 4
    initial_coordinates: [4,2]
    final_coordinates: [4,2]

relationships:
    - green_shape_bounds:  The green shape defines an area within the top two rows.
    - changed_pixel_location: The changed pixel is at a row,col position at a distance from other objects

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: unknown
    target: changed_pixel
    precondition: pixel is white,
                  pixel is at a specific location relative to the other green object
    postcondition: pixel is yellow
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the green shape:** Find all pixels with a value of 3 (green) that are connected. In this specific case, the connected green pixels are in the first two rows.
2.  **Locate Target position:** find the row index that is furthest from the green object, in this case the last row. Locate a position in the center of that row.
3. **Change one pixel:** If a pixel's value at that location is 0 (white) and it matches the target location determined by step 2, change its value to 4 (yellow).
4.  **Preserve the rest:** All other pixels retain their original values.

In essence, the rule seems to involve identifying a specific shape (defined by green pixels) and, based on their position, altering a single, specifically located, white pixel to yellow.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
