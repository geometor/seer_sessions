Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a smaller section of non-zero (non-white) pixels, while the output grid has a larger, repeating pattern. The colors in the input (red, azure, green, and white) are all present in the output. The input grid is 7x7, and the output grid is 7x7. The upper left 3x3 subgrid seems to determine the pattern.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [7, 7]  # Both input and output
      elements: pixels
      colors: [red, azure, green, white]
  - type: subgrid
    properties:
       dimensions: [3,3]
       location: upper-left
       role: pattern_source

actions:
  - name: replicate_pattern
    agent: subgrid
    target: full_grid

relationships:
  - subject: subgrid
    relation: defines_pattern_for
    object: full_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:** Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid. This subgrid will serve as the repeating pattern unit. In this example it is `[[2, 8, 3], [8, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0]]`

2.  **Replicate and Fill:** Replicate this 3x3 pattern across the entire output grid, tiling it horizontally and vertically. Replace all 0s with the value of the pixel to its immediate left.

3. Specifically, iterate through the output grid. For each cell:
    - if the corresponding input x,y coordinates mod 3 match the output x,y coordinate, set the output value to be equal to the input value at the mod 3 coordinate.
    - otherwise, if the cell value is 0 (white), set its value to the color of the cell immediately to its left.
    - If no value to left, look up.
