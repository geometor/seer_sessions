The input grid contains a diagonal line of numbers (8, 3) extending from the top-right to the bottom-left. Another diagonal of numbers (4) extends from near the middle-right towards the bottom-center.  The output grid seems to be a tessellation or tiling, using the numbers, and possibly colors from input, in repeating 2x2 pattern. The colors in the input grid are not uniformly distributed and appear related to specific number.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
