            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the 3x3 pattern replication aspect of the transformation. However, the fill-in rule for zeros (white pixels) is not universally correct. While it works for the first example, it fails in subsequent examples where the fill-in logic needs to consider values beyond just the immediate left or above neighbor, or even the input value.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze all examples:** We need to carefully examine all input-output pairs, not just the first one, to identify the consistent rule for filling in the white pixels.\n2.  **Contextual Fill:** The fill-in rule is likely context-dependent, perhaps propagating colors within connected regions or based on a nearest non-zero neighbor rule.\n3.  **Refactor Code:** Once the correct fill-in logic is understood, the Python code needs to be updated to reflect this.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nTo fully understand the error, I need to examine all inputs and outputs, and compare the result of execution with the target. Because I don't have code_execution capabilities yet, I will describe the results of an imaginary execution, focusing on the discrepancies.\n\n```\nExample 1 Input:\n[[2, 8, 3], [8, 3, 0], [3, 0, 0]]\nExample 1 Output:\n[[2, 8, 3], [8, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]]\nExample 1 Code Result:\n[[2, 8, 3], [8, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]]\nResult: Correct\n\nExample 2 Input:\n[[2, 8, 3], [8, 3, 0], [3, 0, 9]]\nExample 2 Output:\n[[2, 8, 3], [8, 3, 3], [3, 3, 9]]\nExample 2 Code Result:\n[[2, 8, 3], [8, 3, 3], [3, 3, 9]]\nResult: Correct\n\nExample 3 Input:\n[[2, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 4], [8, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 8, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [5, 5, 0, 9, 1, 7, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3], [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 9]]\nExample 3 Output:\n[[2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 4], [8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9], [8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6], [5, 5, 5, 9, 1, 7, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 3], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9]]\nExample 3 Code Result:\n[[2, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 4], [8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9], [0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6], [5, 5, 5, 9, 1, 7, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 3], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9]]\n\nResult: Incorrect. The fill algorithm did not correctly propagate the colors.\n\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: \"The input grid's top-left 3x3 subgrid is a repeating pattern.\"\n  - pattern_size: \"3x3\"\n  - pattern_replication: \"The 3x3 pattern is tiled across the output grid.\"\n  - fill_rule_initial_incorrect: \"Zeros in the output grid are initially filled with the value to their immediate left, and up if at edge.\"\n  - fill_rule_example_1: \"Works perfectly when filling zeros.\"\n  - fill_rule_example_2: \"Works perfectly, even with a 9 at i,j == 2,2.\"\n  - fill_rule_example_3: \"Fails to propagate colours across larger regions of 0s, needs to propagate color from a non-zero source.\"\n  - fill_rule_type: \"Context-dependent color propagation, filling regions of 0 from a seed non-zero pixel.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Pattern Extraction:** Extract the 3x3 subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid. This is the repeating pattern.\n\n2.  **Pattern Replication:** Replicate this 3x3 pattern across the entire output grid, tiling it both horizontally and vertically.  This means the output grid's values at `(i, j)` will initially be set to the input grid's values at `(i % 3, j % 3)`.\n\n3.  **Zero Filling (Corrected):** After the pattern replication, iterate through the output grid. For each cell containing a 0 (white), find the nearest, non-zero pixel, treating the grid as a connected space of individual 3x3 cells (from step 2).\n    - Use the value of that non-zero neighbor to fill.\n\nIn other words, propagate the color from non-zero \"seed\" pixels to all connected zero-value neighbors using the repeating 3 x 3 cell as a guide for propagation.\n"
