Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    output_shape = output_grid.shape
    input_values = np.unique(input_grid)
    output_values = np.unique(output_grid)
    return {
        "input_shape": input_shape,
        "output_shape": output_shape,
        "input_values": input_values.tolist(),
        "output_values": output_values.tolist(),
    }

examples = [
    (np.array([[1]]), np.array([[2, 4, 1], [4, 1, 2], [1, 2, 4]])),
    (np.array([[1, 4], [5, 2]]), np.array([[1, 4, 1, 4], [5, 2, 5, 2], [1, 4, 1, 4], [5, 2, 5, 2]])),
    (np.array([[1, 8, 3], [8, 3, 1], [3, 1, 8]]), np.array([[1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3], [8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1], [3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8], [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3], [8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1], [3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8]])),

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and the initial code's output to formulate a comprehensive natural language program and refine the approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code provides a basic analysis of input and output grids, focusing on shape and unique values. This is a good starting point but insufficient to capture the underlying transformation logic. The provided examples clearly demonstrate a pattern of replicating the input grid both horizontally and vertically to create the output grid. The number of replications appears to be consistent: the input is replicated to create an output that is twice height and twice the width of the input.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to go beyond shape and unique values. We must analyze the spatial relationships and how the input grid's content is positioned within the output grid.
2.  **Pattern Identification:** The core pattern seems to be replication. We need to determine the replication factor (how many times the input is copied) in both dimensions.
3.  **Natural Language Program Refinement:** Based on the pattern, we will create a clear, step-by-step natural language program describing the transformation.
4. **Fact Documentation** Create structured documentation of the observations

**Detailed Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Let's re-examine each example with a focus on replication:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[[1]]` (1x1)
    *   Output: `[[2, 4, 1], [4, 1, 2], [1, 2, 4]]` (3x3)
    *   Observation: The input is duplicated, the numbers are also cycling. This first example shows how misleading a single number input can be.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[[1, 4], [5, 2]]` (2x2)
    *   Output: `[[1, 4, 1, 4], [5, 2, 5, 2], [1, 4, 1, 4], [5, 2, 5, 2]]` (4x4)
    *   Observation: The input is perfectly replicated twice horizontally and twice vertically.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: `[[1, 8, 3], [8, 3, 1], [3, 1, 8]]` (3x3)
    *   Output: `[[1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3], [8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1], [3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8], [1, 8, 3, 1, 8, 3], [8, 3, 1, 8, 3, 1], [3, 1, 8, 3, 1, 8]]` (6x6)
    *   Observation:  The input is perfectly replicated twice horizontally and twice vertically.

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
observations:
  example_1:
    input_shape: [1, 1]
    output_shape: [3, 3]
    replication_factor: [3,3] #input is wrong, assumed from output
    pattern: "The output does not follow pattern"
    objects:
        - description: single pixel
          input_value: 1
          output_value: "[2,4,1],[4,1,2],[1,2,4]"
  example_2:
    input_shape: [2, 2]
    output_shape: [4, 4]
    replication_factor: [2, 2]
    pattern: "The input grid is replicated twice horizontally and twice vertically."
    objects:
        - description: 2x2 grid
          input_values: "[1,4],[5,2]"
          output_values: "[1,4,1,4],[5,2,5,2],[1,4,1,4],[5,2,5,2]"
  example_3:
    input_shape: [3, 3]
    output_shape: [6, 6]
    replication_factor: [2, 2]
    pattern: "The input grid is replicated twice horizontally and twice vertically."
    objects:
        - description: 3x3 grid
          input_values: "[1,8,3],[8,3,1],[3,1,8]"
          output_values: "[1,8,3,1,8,3],[8,3,1,8,3,1],[3,1,8,3,1,8],[1,8,3,1,8,3],[8,3,1,8,3,1],[3,1,8,3,1,8]"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the input grid's dimensions (height and width).
2.  **Replicate** the entire input grid twice horizontally (double the width).
3.  **Replicate** the result of step 2 twice vertically (double the height).
4. **Output**: the result

Based on the new analysis and putting aside the first example, the main transformation rule is a 2x2 replication of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
