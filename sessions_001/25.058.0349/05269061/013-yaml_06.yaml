  The task involves transforming a grid of colored numbers into a new grid with a repeating pattern.
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      notable_elements:
          - value: 8
            color: azure
          - value: 3
            color: green
          - value: 4
            color: yellow
        
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x7
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      pattern: repeating 2x2 structure

actions:
  - name: identify_pattern
    description: Find the core repeating unit in output.
  - name: map_colors
    description: Determine the relationship between numbers in input and elements of output.
  - name: replicate
    description: construct output using rule

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by extracting a set of colored values, generating a 2x2 pattern based on it, and replicating the 2 x 2 pattern to create the entire output grid.
