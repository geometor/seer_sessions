## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x320 at 0x76911EBFDBD0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=704x320 at 0x76911EBFDB30>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid (2D array) of colored pixels. The input grid contains a blue pixel (1) and a red pixel (2) on the second row, with the rest being white (0). The output grid maintains the same structure but transforms the pixels between the blue and red pixels into blue and red segments, separated by a gray pixel (5).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains two distinct objects: a blue pixel (1) and a red pixel (2).
  - object_properties: |
      - Object 1: Color - Blue (1), Location - (1, 0) [row 1, column 0, using 0-indexing].
      - Object 2: Color - Red (2), Location - (1, 10).
  - spatial_relationship: |
      Both objects are on the same row (row index 1).
  - transformation: |
      Pixels between the blue and red pixels in the input are replaced.
  - transformation_details: |
      - Pixels to the left of the midpoint become blue (1).
      - Pixels to the right of the midpoint become red (2).
      - A gray pixel (5) is placed at the midpoint.
  - grid_dimensions:
      - rows: 5
      - columns: 11
  - output_description: The output grid contains colored region that expands between blue pixel and red pixel, separated by a gray pixel in the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Objects:** Locate the blue pixel (1) and the red pixel (2) within the input grid. Note their positions.
2.  **Determine Midpoint:** Calculate the horizontal midpoint between the blue and red pixels. If the distance between them is odd there will be one pixel at the midpoint position. If the distance is even, the midpoint will be between two pixels.
3. **Fill Left Segment:** Change all the pixels horizontally to the left side of the midpoint on the same row to blue (1).
4. **Place Middle Pixel:** Place a single grey pixel (5) on the same row at the midpoint.
5.  **Fill Right Segment:** Change all pixels horizontally to the right side of the midpoint on the same row to red (2).
6. **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels in the grid retain their original colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
