The input grid contains a blue pixel (1) and a red pixel (2) on the second row, with the rest being white (0). The output grid maintains the same structure but transforms the pixels between the blue and red pixels into blue and red segments, separated by a gray pixel (5).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If the distance between them is odd there will be one pixel at the midpoint position. If the distance is even, the midpoint will be between two pixels.\n3. **Fill Left Segment:** Change all the pixels horizontally to the left side of the midpoint on the same row to blue (1).\n4. **Place Middle Pixel:** Place a single grey pixel (5) on the same row at the midpoint.\n5.  **Fill Right Segment:** Change all pixels horizontally to the right side of the midpoint on the same row to red (2).\n6. **Preserve Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels in the grid retain their original colors.\n"
