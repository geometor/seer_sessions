      The transformation identifies the center pixel of the input grid and replicates its color to two specific locations:
      1. The pixel immediately to the right of the center pixel.
      2. The pixel in the bottom-right corner of the grid.
  - objects:
    - name: center_pixel
      properties:
        - color: Varies (Blue, Green, Yellow, Red, Gray in the examples)
        - location: Center of the input grid (row = rows // 2, col = cols // 2)
    - name: right_adjacent_pixel
      properties:
          - color: same as center_pixel, after transformation
          - location: (row = center_pixel.row, col = center_pixel.col + 1)
    - name: bottom_right_pixel
      properties:
        - color: same as center_pixel, after transformation
        - location: (row = input_grid.rows - 1, col = input_grid.cols - 1)
  - actions:
    - name: color_replication
      description: The color of the center pixel is copied to the right adjacent pixel and the bottom-right pixel.
  - constraints:
      - The input grids are square,
      - The input grids seem always to have odd dimensions
      - All other pixels in the grid remain white(0)
  - notes: |
      The provided examples are consistent. The color of the input grid's center pixel
      is copied to the pixel to the right and to the pixel in the bottom right corner.
