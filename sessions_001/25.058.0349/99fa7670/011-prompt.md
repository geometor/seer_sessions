Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Center Pixel:** Determine the center pixel of the input grid. This is located at `(rows // 2, cols // 2)`, where `rows` and `cols` are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.
2.  **Copy the Center Pixel's Color:** Note the color value of the center pixel.
3. **Replicate to the Right:** Change the value of the grid at the location immediately to the right of the center, at coordinates `(rows // 2, cols // 2 + 1)`, making it equal to the color of the center pixel.
4. **Replicate to the Bottom-Right:** Change the value of the grid at the bottom-right corner, `(rows - 1, cols - 1)` to be equal to the color of the center pixel.
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid retain their original color (white/0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
