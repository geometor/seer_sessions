Both grids are 6x6 and contain numerical values representing colors. The input grid has two distinct non-zero values (2 and 3, corresponding to red and green) placed in seemingly arbitrary positions, while the rest of the grid is filled with zeros (white). The output grid expands these non-zero values into rectangular blocks.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
