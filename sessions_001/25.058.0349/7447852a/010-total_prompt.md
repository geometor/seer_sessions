Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a horizontal and vertical filling operation with yellow (4) between red (2) pixels, up to a distance of 3 units. The provided feedback shows that the transformation works for example input 2, but fails for 0, 1, and 3.

The errors described indicate specific situations not captured by the first attempt. Example 1 includes diagonal fills and some cases where the fill stops before 3 if it hits another color.

So the main errors seem to occur because:

1.  The initial code only fills horizontally and vertically, missing diagonal fills.
2.  The initial code does not always connect regions correctly
3.  The fill can only be white or red.

The strategy to resolve these issues will involve:

1.  **Extending the filling mechanism**: Modify the code to include diagonal filling in addition to horizontal and vertical.
2.  **Connectivity**: revise the filling logic to flood fill instead of a fixed
    distance.
3.  **Color Constraint:** Ensure only white and red pixels can be filled

**Metrics and Observations**
Here's a breakdown of each example, including an analysis of where the initial program's logic likely falls short:

*   **Example 0:**
    *   Input: Has multiple disjoint red regions.
    *   Output: Red regions connected by yellow.
    * observation: existing code will succeed with example 0

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Includes diagonal red components and other colors.
    *   Output: Fills between the diagonal red regions but does not fill to
        other colors.
    * observation: will fail because of diagonal and color check.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Simple horizontal and vertical arrangements.
    *   Output: Matches the expected horizontal and vertical filling.
    * observation: existing code will succeed with example 2

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Small red regions and some other colors.
    *   Output: Shows connection between red and also respects other colors
    * observation: will fail because of color check

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: red_regions
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - shape: variable, can be single pixels or contiguous groups
    actions:
      - identified: Locate all red pixels.
      - connected: Regions are connected by a flood fill.

  - object: filled_regions
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: variable, fills spaces between red regions
      - constraints: only white and red pixels may be filled.
    actions:
      - fill: Extend from red regions, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
      - constraint: Stops when non-white and non-red pixels are encountered

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Regions:** Locate all pixels with the color red (value 2) in the input grid. These pixels define the starting points for the filling operation.

2.  **Flood Fill with Constraints:** For each red pixel, initiate a flood fill operation with yellow (value 4). This fill should extend in all eight directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

3.  **Filling Constraint:** During the fill, only replace pixels that are white (0) or red (2). If a pixel of any other color is encountered, the fill stops in that direction. The fill will naturally connect red regions because it extends in all directions until obstructed.

This refined program addresses the identified shortcomings by incorporating diagonal filling, connectivity between regions, and a constraint based on the encountered pixel's color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
