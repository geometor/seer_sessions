The primary colors observed are red (2), white (0), and yellow (4). The input grid transforms into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a selective replacement of white (0) pixels with yellow (4) pixels, based on the positions of red (2) pixels. It's a local operation as values change due to adjacent pixels, and the transformation appears to be row-independent, meaning the same operation is performed at the same row index of each grid, and on each row of the grids.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
