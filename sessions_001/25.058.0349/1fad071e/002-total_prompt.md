## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1
0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0
0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2
1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x76911EBFDBD0>

**output:**
```
1 1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x7691263193B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger 2D grid (input) into a smaller 2D grid (output). The input grid contains pixels of various colors represented by integers (0-9, with 0: white, 1: blue, 2: red). The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on specific colors or patterns. The example shows a reduction in both dimensions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - name: dimensions
        value: (rows, columns)
      - name: colors
        value: [0, 1, 2]  # Based on the example
    instances:
      - id: input_grid
        dimensions: (9, 9)
      - id: output_grid
        dimensions: (1, 5)

actions:
  - name: count_color_blocks
    description: Counts the number of contiguous blocks of a specific color.
    parameters:
      - name: grid
        type: grid
      - name: color
        type: int

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: input_grid is transformed into output_grid
    rule: "The output grid contains the number of contiguous blocks per a specific color."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** The transformation seems to focus on blue (1) and potentially white(0).
2.  **Count Contiguous Blocks:** For the input grid, count the number of contiguous blocks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally connected) of blue (1) and record the number of separate instances.
3. **Construct the Output grid:**
    The output grid consists one row. The value of each cell is the instance count of the color. The first value is the number of blue blocks, then the number of white blocks.

In short - The transformation identifies the object count of specific colors (blue and white), and displays them sequentially in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
