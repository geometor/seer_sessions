Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code focused on counting contiguous blocks of blue and white pixels. While this worked for the first example, it failed on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule is more complex than simply counting blue and white blocks. The output seems to represent some relationship or interaction between different colored objects, not just the raw counts. The added attempt to calculate `non_white` surrounded by white was a good intuition, but not correctly applied, and is insufficient to describe the complete transformation.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Re-examine all examples:** Carefully analyze each input/output pair, focusing on object properties (shape, size, color), relative positions, and interactions.
2.  **Develop Detailed Observations:** Create detailed YAML-formatted observations for each example, recording all relevant object attributes and relationships.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the enriched observations, revise the natural language program to describe the transformation more accurately and completely. It should explain exactly how the output values are determined, even if the underlying logic is intricate.
4. **Consider alternative object identification**: the current definition of a
   contiguous block might be too general - consider if specific colors should be
   considered, or sub-objects within larger objects.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

To understand the patterns, let's perform a detailed analysis of each example. I will describe the grids, and focus on identifying consistent logic in the transformations.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Output:** `[[1, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`
* **Analysis:**
    - There's one blue pixel.
    - previous code counted 7 white regions, likely due to an infinite plane
      assumption
    - We previously considered that the blue pixel, surrounded by white,
      contributed 1, but this does not explain the 7.
    - I hypothesize the output is related to counts of specific colors, *and*
      their adjacencies.
    - **Key:** The first value `1` is the single blue pixel. Let's treat that as a given.
    - **Hypothesis for 7:** Let's count the number of *rows* + *columns* in the
      input, then subtract the number of rows and columns that contain the color
      blue: (7 + 10) - (1 + 1) = 15. The number of white regions can also be found by multiplying rows with blues by columns with blues 1*1 = 1, then subtracting from the total number of cells, 70-1 = 69, and adjusting for the isolated blue 70 - 1 = 69.
    - the output width is 5

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Output:** `[[2, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`
* **Analysis:**
    - There are two blue pixels side-by-side.
    - The code correctly counted 2 blue blocks if run.
      - The number of white regions could again be found 70 - 2 = 68.
      - The output width is still 5.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

    ```
*   **Output:** `[[3, 7, 0, 0, 0]]`

* **Analysis**:
    - Three blue pixels.
    - Following previous hypothesis: the output should be `[3, 7, 0, 0, 0]`
      - The number of white regions = 70 - 3 = 67
      - the output size is fixed at 5

**YAML Observations**
```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_grid:
      rows: 7
      cols: 10
      objects:
        - color: blue
          count: 1
          shape: single pixel
        - color: white
          count: 69 # white cells adjacent to a blue
    output_grid:
      values: [1, 7, 0, 0, 0]
    observations: |
       The first output value corresponds to the number of distinct blue regions.
       The second output value corresponds to number of rows + columns of the
       input. The next 3 are zero.

  - example_id: 2
    input_grid:
      rows: 7
      cols: 10
      objects:
        - color: blue
          count: 2
          shape: horizontal line of 2 pixels
        - color: white
          count: 68
    output_grid:
      values: [2, 7, 0, 0, 0]
    observations: |
       The first output value corresponds to the number of blue pixels.
      The second output value is the number of rows.

  - example_id: 3
    input_grid:
      rows: 7
      cols: 10
      objects:
        - color: blue
          count: 3
          shape: horizontal line of 3 pixels
        - color: white
          count: 67
    output_grid:
      values: [3, 7, 0, 0, 0]
    observations: |
      The first output value corresponds to the number of blue pixels.
      The second output value corresponds to the number of rows.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Count Blue Pixels:** Count the number of blue pixels in the input grid. This count will be the first value in the output.
2.  **Determine Row Count** Count the number of rows in the input grid. This will be the second number in the output.
3. **Pad with Zeroes:** The output grid is always 1x5. Pad the remaining values of the output with zeros.

This program correctly accounts for the number of objects and their properties, as opposed to the contiguous block counting approach.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
