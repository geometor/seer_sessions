Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Inner Region:** Locate the rectangular region within the input grid that is enclosed by the blue (1) border.

2.  **Locate corner pixels of non-blue, non-white regions:**  Identify "corner" pixels inside the inner region. A "corner" means a colored pixel, which is *not* white or blue that makes a corner when considering all non-white and non-blue regions, and that are adjacent to either a white or blue.

3. **Sample corner pixels in clockwise order:** The corners define an ordered set of pixels, starting at the top-left, then top-right, bottom-right and finally bottom-left

4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid.

5.  **Place Extracted Colors:** Populate the output grid in the order with values identified earlier:
    *   Top-left corner color goes to output grid (0,1).
    *   Top-right corner color goes to output grid (1,3).
    *    Bottom-right corner color goes to output grid (2,2).
    *   Bottom-left corner color goes to output grid (3,0).
    *   If multiple, adjacent, corner colors are identified, perform this same action to adjacent cells in the output grid, starting with the positions described.
6. **Fill:** Fill the remaining cells of the output grid with 0 (white).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
