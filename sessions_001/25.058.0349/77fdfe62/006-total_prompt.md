Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Locate all pixels within the input grid that are not white (0).

2. **Order Non-White Pixels:** Order these pixels based on their position in the grid. The order is determined by reading the grid in a "Z" pattern: top-left to top-right, then move down to the next non-white pixel to its left or right, and so on, zigzagging down the grid.

3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 4x4 output grid.

4.  **Place Extracted Colors:** Populate the output grid sequentially with the colors of the ordered non-white pixels, starting from the top-left cell (0,0) and moving left-to-right, then top-to-bottom. If there are more non-white pixels than cells in the output grid, fill only up to the available slots. If fewer, leave the remaining output grid cells as white (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to all cases. The core idea of extracting non-white pixels and placing them into a 4x4 grid is partially correct. However, the Z-order sorting and the way colors are mapped appears incorrect. Instead of Z order, a simple extraction from top-left to bottom-right, as in a standard raster scan, appears to be appropriate. The code has other errors as well. The provided examples will provide the hints about how to adjust the algorithm.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair, noting the specific arrangement of non-white pixels and how they map to the output.
2.  **Error Identification:** Pinpoint discrepancies between the code's output and the expected output.
3.  **Pattern Refinement:** Adjust the natural language program to describe a rule that holds true for *all* training examples.
4. **Code Review**: consider what needs to happen in the code and how the current version could be improved to reflect the facts and program.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

I need to compare the `output_grid` from the `transform` function and the `output` from the problem. I can create a simple comparison function:

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    return np.array_equal(grid1, grid2)

def array_to_string(arr):
    return '\n'.join([' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in arr])

def test_transform(transform, task):
  for i, example in enumerate(task['train']):
     input_grid = example['input']
     expected_output = example['output']
     actual_output = transform(input_grid)
     print(f"Example {i + 1}:")
     print(f"Input:\n{array_to_string(input_grid)}")
     print(f"Expected Output:\n{array_to_string(expected_output)}")
     print(f"Actual Output:\n{array_to_string(actual_output)}")
     print(f"Match: {compare_grids(actual_output, expected_output)}")
     print("-" * 20)
```

Now use the function to view the differences:

```python
task = {
    "train": [
        {
            "input": [
                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9] # Represents different colors
      - dimensions: variable (up to 30x30)

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - dimensions: 4x4

  - name: non_white_blocks
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      - color: non-zero integer
      - shape: rectangular (in these examples)
      - position: row and column index in input_grid

actions:
  - name: extract_blocks
    description: Identify contiguous blocks of non-white pixels within the input grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: list of non_white_blocks

  - name: order_blocks
    description: Order the extracted blocks based on their top-left pixel position, reading from top to bottom and left to right.
    input: list of non_white_blocks
    output: ordered list of non_white_blocks

  - name: populate_output
    description: Fill the 4x4 output grid with the colors of the ordered blocks.
    input: ordered list of non_white_blocks, output_grid
    output: populated output_grid
    rules:
      - Iterate through blocks from first to last.
      - For each block iterate the pixels in the block.
      - Fill the cells of the output_grid from top-left, row by row, with the color of the pixel.
      - If the output_grid is full, stop. If all the block pixels are placed, fill the remaining cells of the output grid with white (0).
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Non-White Blocks:** Examine the input grid and identify contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. A block is defined as a rectangular region of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Order Blocks:** Order the identified blocks. Ordering is done based on the position of the block within the input grid, reading the input grid in a standard raster scan (from top to bottom, and within each row, from left to right). Use the top-left pixel of a block as the block position.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Prepare a 4x4 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
4.  **Populate Output Grid:** Fill the output grid with colors from the ordered blocks.
    *   Start at the top-left cell (0, 0) of the output grid.
    *   Iterate through the non-white blocks in order.
    *   Iterate the pixels of a block, taking the colors row by row, left to right.
    * Place the pixel color into the output grid moving from left-to-right, top-to-bottom
    *   If the output grid is full, stop populating.
    *   If all non-white pixels have been placed, complete filling the rest of the output grid with 0.

This improved natural language program captures the consistent pattern observed across all training examples. It clarifies the object identification (contiguous blocks), the ordering method (raster-scan order of the block's top-left corner), and the output grid population process. The key changes from the original are changing individual pixels to rectangular blocks of pixels, a change in the ordering process and providing clearer instructions for filling the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # change output pixels
