The input grid appears to be smaller and simpler than the output grid. There's a clear presence of a single gray pixel (value 5) in the input, which seems to be replicated in the output. The output grid also introduces a new color, azure (value 8), not present in the input, arranged in a specific pattern. The output grid's dimensions are larger and seem to be related to a repeating pattern involving the original input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Each gray should map to cells at \\[row*2, col*2], \\[row*2+1, col*2], \\[row * 2, col * 2 + 1], and \\[row*2 + 1, col*2 + 1].\n3. **Fill Azure:** Fill the remaining top and bottom rows with alternating azure (8) and white(0) colors.\n4. Fill the first and last columns on all even rows with alternating azure (8) and white(0) colors.\n5.  fill the rest with white (0).\n\nEssentially the output pattern is created by doubling the input grid size, replicating the grey areas into 2x2 blocks, and applying a pattern of alternating azure and white around the gray pixels.\n"
