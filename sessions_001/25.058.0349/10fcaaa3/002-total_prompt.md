## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x128 at 0x76911EB26350>

**output:**
```
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0
8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0
0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x256 at 0x76911EB263F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of numerical values. The input grid appears to be smaller and simpler than the output grid. There's a clear presence of a single gray pixel (value 5) in the input, which seems to be replicated in the output. The output grid also introduces a new color, azure (value 8), not present in the input, arranged in a specific pattern. The output grid's dimensions are larger and seem to be related to a repeating pattern involving the original input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2x4
      - values: [0, 5]
      - colors: [white, gray]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4x8
      - values: [0, 5, 8]
      - colors: [white, gray, azure]
  - observation: gray_pixel_replication
    description: The gray pixel (5) from the input grid is present multiple times in the output grid.
  - observation: azure_pattern
    description: Azure pixels (8) form a border around empty cells.
  - observation: output_size_relation
    description: The output grid's dimensions are double that input in height and double in width.
  - action: pattern_expansion
    description: create a checkered pattern
  - action: replicate_grey
    description: replicate the grey pixels in a 2x2 area of the new grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Double Dimensions:** Create a new grid with double the height and double the width of the input grid.
2. **Replicate Gray:** For every gray pixel (value 5) in the input grid, copy it to the corresponding position in the output grid, but also create 3 more copies to form a 2x2 block of gray color. Each gray should map to cells at \[row*2, col*2], \[row*2+1, col*2], \[row * 2, col * 2 + 1], and \[row*2 + 1, col*2 + 1].
3. **Fill Azure:** Fill the remaining top and bottom rows with alternating azure (8) and white(0) colors.
4. Fill the first and last columns on all even rows with alternating azure (8) and white(0) colors.
5.  fill the rest with white (0).

Essentially the output pattern is created by doubling the input grid size, replicating the grey areas into 2x2 blocks, and applying a pattern of alternating azure and white around the gray pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
