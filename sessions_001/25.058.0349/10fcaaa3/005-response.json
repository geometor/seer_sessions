The code correctly identifies and replicates gray pixels as 2x2 blocks. It also attempts to create a checkered pattern on even rows. However, the validation results indicate discrepancies, meaning the implementation of the checkered pattern and possibly other aspects are not fully aligned with the task's logic.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors is to:\n\n1.  **Carefully re-examine *all* training examples:** Pay close attention to *all* the colors and patterns, not just the gray and azure/white ones that were the initial focus. The current code is missing a key aspect, so a thorough review is needed.\n2.  **Focus on rows:** The provided description highlighted every other row. Look for other elements on even rows\n3.  **Identify ALL object interactions:** The current logic only addresses grey objects, ignoring possible interactions with other colors.\n4.  **Precise Pattern Description:** Refine the description of the checkered pattern, being more specific about its placement and interaction with the replicated gray blocks.\n5. **Use Code to Measure** determine exact counts of objects, rows, and columns\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo accurately describe the findings, I'll analyze the shapes and colors present in each input/output pair, and compare it with the output from current code using code execution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_metrics(grid):\n    \"\"\"Calculates object counts and other metrics for a given grid.\"\"\"\n
