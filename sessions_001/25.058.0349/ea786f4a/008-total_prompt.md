## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2
2 2 0 2 2
2 2 2 2 2
2 2 2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x76911E9AE170>

**output:**
```
0 2 2 2 0
2 0 2 0 2
2 2 0 2 2
2 0 2 0 2
0 2 2 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x76911E9AEC10>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and creating a natural language program to describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (5x5 in this case).
*   The grids contain two colors: red (represented by the number 2) and white (represented by the number 0).
*   The central pixel in the input grid is white, surrounded by red pixels.
*   The output grid shows a checkerboard-like pattern of white and red, emanating outwards from the original, central white pixel.
*   The white central pixel from the input grid "expands", preserving the original central white pixel.
*   The transformation changes the values on the diagonals and the orthogonal cardinal directions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - values: [0, 2]  # 0 represents white, 2 represents red

  - name: pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color:
        - white (0)
        - red (2)
      - position: (row, column)  # Using 0-based indexing

actions:
  - name: transform
    description: Changes pixel colors based on their position relative to the center.
    input: grid
    output: grid

relationships:
  - type: contains
    subject: grid
    object: pixel

  - type: adjacency
    subject: pixel
    object: pixel
    properties:
      - orthogonal: Directly above, below, left, or right
      - diagonal: Connected at the corners
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Locate the center pixel of the input grid. In a 5x5 grid, this is at position (2, 2) using 0-based indexing.

2.  **Preserve the Center:** The central pixel in the output grid has the *same* value as the central pixel in the input grid.

3.  **Checkerboard Expansion:** Extend a checkerboard pattern from the center outwards.
    *   Pixels that are orthogonally *or* diagonally adjacent to a white pixel become red.
    *   Pixels that are orthogonally *or* diagonally adjacent to a red pixel become white.

4.  **Iterate to edges**: perform this expansion until the entire grid has been transformed.

In essence, the central pixel's color propagates outwards in a checkerboard pattern, transforming adjacent pixels. The initial state of the central pixel dictates this checkerboard.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
