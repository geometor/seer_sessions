facts:
  - object: white_pixel
    description: Represents the color white (value 0).
    properties:
      input_count: [1, 1, 2] # Number of white pixels in each input example
      output_count: [3, 5, 10]   # Number of white pixels in each output example
      input_coordinates:
          - "Column indices with white pixels: [4]"
          - "Column indices with white pixels: [3]"
          - "Column indices with white pixels: [3, 5]"
  - object: gray_pixel
    description: Represents the color gray (value 5)
    properties:
      input_count: "All non-white pixels"
      behavior: "gray pixels in the input remain gray in the output in corresponding positions"
  - transformation: white_line_generation
    description: "A single white pixel in the input becomes a vertical line of white pixels in the output, extending down for height of rows with at least one white."
    properties:
       height: "the number of rows that contain *at least* one white pixel in the input grid"
       x_coordinate: "Maintained from the input white pixel's column"
