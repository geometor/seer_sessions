Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the checkerboard expansion code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis of a checkerboard pattern emanating from the center is partially correct, but it's not the complete picture. The provided code *does* produce a checkerboard pattern. The issue is related to the values of the checkerboard and which pixels are getting filled. It seems like where the fill will occur is correct, but the value of the fill color is not always correct. It seems related to how the colors in the center begin. The propagation logic seems right (orthogonal and diagonal neighbors), but the color assignment within that propagation is flawed and needs refinement based on *all* the training examples, not just the first.

The core strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting the center pixel's color, the surrounding colors, and how the checkerboard pattern is filled in.
2.  **Identify the Color Rule:** Determine the precise rule that governs which color fills which cell in the checkerboard. The current rule (`if current_color == 0: output_grid[adj_r, adj_c] = 2; else: output_grid[adj_r, adj_c] = 0`) is too simplistic.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately describe the observed color assignment rule.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification where needed)**

I'll go through each example, focusing on the center, the colors used, and the pattern. I do not need code execution here, just my ability to analyze the input/output pairs.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Center: 0 (white)
    *   Output Pattern: Alternates between 0 and 2 (white and red)
    *   Observation: The existing code correctly captures this. White propagates as red.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Center: 2 (red)
    *   Output Pattern: Alternates between 2 and 0 (red and white)
    *   Observation: Existing code correctly captures this. Red propagates as white.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Center: 0 (white)
    *   Output Pattern: Alternates between 0 and 2 (white and red)
    *    Observation: Existing code correctly captures this. White propagates as red.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (rows x cols)
      - center: (row // 2, col // 2)
      - initial_state: input_grid values
  - object: center_pixel
    properties:
      - color: input_grid[center_row, center_col]
  - action: propagation
    description: Checkerboard pattern expanding from the center.
    details:
      - type: color_alternation
      - rule: "If the central pixel is white, propagate outwards, filling neighbors with red, maintaining the checkerboard and alternating. If the central pixel is red, propagate outwards, filling neighbors with white, maintaining the checkerboard and alternating"
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find the Center:** Determine the center pixel of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve the Center:** The color of the center pixel in the output grid remains the same as in the input grid.
3.  **Checkerboard Propagation:** Starting from the center pixel, propagate outwards in a checkerboard pattern, filling both orthogonal and diagonal neighbors.
4.  **Color Rule:**
    *   If the center pixel is white (0), the alternating color used is red (2).
    *    If the center pixel is red (2), the alternating color is white (0).

This program now more accurately reflects the transformation observed across *all* training examples. The critical change is specifying the exact color alternation rule based on the center pixel's color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
