The input grid primarily consists of white (0) pixels with a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The output grid introduces azure (8) pixels alongside the orange ones, creating a patterned, potentially expanded, version of the initial orange line. The transformation seems to involve a local operation around the orange pixels, replacing some adjacent white pixels with azure ones. The overall grid dimensions remain the same.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Create Checkered pattern: The input's orange pixels form part of output.\n4.  Checkered filling: check to the right of the existing orange (7) pixels, and change the color of white (0) to azure (8).\n5.  The dimension of the output grid is same as input grid.\n\nEssentially, the transformation creates an alternating checkerboard like pattern of orange and azure pixels, originating from the initial orange line, while preserving the dimensions of the original grid. The generation of the pattern appears to follow a simple rule: if a white pixel is immediately to the right of orange pixel, change it to a blue pixel, starting from top to bottom.\n"
