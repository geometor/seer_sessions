## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x448 at 0x76911E9AF7F0>

**output:**
```
7 8 7 8 7 8 7 0
7 8 7 8 7 8 0 0
7 8 7 8 7 0 0 0
0 8 7 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid primarily consists of white (0) pixels with a vertical line of orange (7) pixels. The output grid introduces azure (8) pixels alongside the orange ones, creating a patterned, potentially expanded, version of the initial orange line. The transformation seems to involve a local operation around the orange pixels, replacing some adjacent white pixels with azure ones. The overall grid dimensions remain the same.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x8 (rows x columns)
      colors: [white, orange]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 7x8 (rows x columns)
      colors: [white, orange, azure]
  - object: orange_line
    type: line
    properties:
      orientation: vertical
      location: column 3 (in input)
      color: orange
    relationship: "transforms_to expanded_pattern in output"
  - object: azure_pixels
    type: pixels
    properties:
      color: azure
    relationship: "appear adjacent to orange pixels in output"
  - action: replacement
    description: "white pixels adjacent to orange pixels are replaced based on a pattern."
  - pattern: checkered
    description: "alternating orange and azure starting from top to down and left to right"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the orange (7) pixels** in the input grid.
2.  **Iterate** from top left to bottom right of the input
3.  Create Checkered pattern: The input's orange pixels form part of output.
4.  Checkered filling: check to the right of the existing orange (7) pixels, and change the color of white (0) to azure (8).
5.  The dimension of the output grid is same as input grid.

Essentially, the transformation creates an alternating checkerboard like pattern of orange and azure pixels, originating from the initial orange line, while preserving the dimensions of the original grid. The generation of the pattern appears to follow a simple rule: if a white pixel is immediately to the right of orange pixel, change it to a blue pixel, starting from top to bottom.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
