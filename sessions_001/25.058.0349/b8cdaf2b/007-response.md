Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the example provided:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 5x5 grids.
*   **Colors/Values:** The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The prominent colors are white (0), azure (8), and green (3).
*   **Shapes:** There's a horizontal line of azure (8) pixels at the bottom, with a single green (3) pixel in the center of it. There are also scattered white (0) pixels.
*    **Transformation:** The green (3) appears to have, moved, or spread, upwards, creating additional green pixels. The azure (8) remains unchanged.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    elements: pixels
    
  - type: pixel
    values: [0, 3, 8]
    colors:
      0: white
      3: green
      8: azure

  - type: object
    color: azure
    shape: line
    location: bottom row

  -type: object
   color: green
   shape: single pixel
   location: center of azure line

actions:
  - type: propagate
    agent: green pixel
    direction: upwards
    constraints:
      - stops at top row
      - maintains vertical alignment

relationships:
  - green pixel is_contained_within azure line, initially
  - green pixels maintain_column after propagation

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the green (3) pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Propagate** the green color upwards from its original position.
3.  For each row above the original green pixel, replace the existing pixel in that column with a green (3) pixel.
4. **Stop** when the top row is reached.
5.  **Preserve** all other pixels (including the azure (8) pixels) in their original positions and colors.

In simpler term: Find the Green pixel, then make a vertical line of green pixels from the original up to the top. All of the other colors remain.
