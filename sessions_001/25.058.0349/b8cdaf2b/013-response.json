The primary colors observed are white (0), magenta (6), and blue (1). The input grid appears to have a pattern involving horizontal lines of magenta and blue, bordered by white. The output grid seems to maintain the bottom two rows (magenta and blue) and modifies the area above. Specifically, it introduces two blue pixels at the corners of the third row from the bottom, leaving the rest of the top part as white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
