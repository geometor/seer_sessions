            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were on the right track, focusing on identifying yellow pixels in the bottom row and moving them up. However, the validation results reveal a crucial flaw: the code doesn't correctly handle cases where the yellow block's upward movement is obstructed by *any* non-blank pixel, not just other yellow pixels. The current description incorrectly mentions obstructions. The initial program works fine for the examples where empty space is above the bottom row, but fails when other non-empty pixels are encountered.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The core assumption about moving yellow blocks two rows up is valid. However, the condition for moving the block needs refinement. It's not just about avoiding overwriting other yellow pixels; it's about avoiding overwriting *any* non-blank (non-zero) pixel.\n2.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to analyze the input and output grids, specifically looking at the yellow pixels, their initial positions, final positions, and the presence of any obstructing pixels.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:**  The updated natural language program must accurately reflect the \"move up two rows unless obstructed by any non-blank pixel\" rule.\n4.  **Focus on obstruction:** clarify the handling for moving blocks and obstructions.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo accurately describe the transformations and identify the limitations of the current code, I need to check if the assumptions are applied to all the training examples.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my observations, including assumed facts and actions:\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 0\n    yellow_pixels_bottom_row:\n      initial: [(2,2), (2,3)]\n      final:   [(0,2), (0,3)]\n    obstruction_present: false\n    move_successful: true\n  - example_id: 1\n    yellow_pixels_bottom_row:\n      initial: [(5,4), (5,5), (5,6)]\n      final:   [(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)]\n    obstruction_present: false\n    move_successful: true\n  - example_id: 2\n    yellow_pixels_bottom_row:\n      initial: [(7,2),(7,3)]\n      final: [(7,2), (7,3)]  # No movement\n    obstruction_present: true  # Red pixel at (5,2)\n    move_successful: false\n  - example_id: 3\n    yellow_pixels_bottom_row:\n        initial: [(3,6)]\n        final: [(3,6)]\n    obstruction_present: true\n    move_successful: false\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: yellow_block\n    description: One or more contiguous yellow (4) pixels in the bottom row of the input grid.\n    properties:\n      color: yellow (4)\n      location: bottom row (initially)\n      shape: varies (single pixel or contiguous horizontal block)\n  - action: move_up\n    description: Attempts to move the yellow_block two rows up.\n    preconditions:\n      - The yellow_block must be in the bottom row.\n    postconditions:\n        - The yellow_block is moved two rows up ONLY IF all target cells two rows above are blank (0).\n        - If ANY target cell is non-blank, the ENTIRE yellow_block remains in its original position. No partial moves occur.\n  - constraint: obstruction\n    description: Any non-blank (non-zero) pixel in the target location two rows above the yellow_block.\n    effect: Prevents the entire yellow_block from moving.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"yellow\\_block\":** Find all yellow (4) pixels in the bottom row of the input grid. These pixels, individually or contiguously, form the \"yellow\\_block\".\n2.  **Determine the target positions:** For each pixel in the \"yellow\\_block\", calculate the target position two rows above its current position.\n3.  **Check for obstructions:** Examine *all* target positions. If *any* of the target positions contain a non-blank (non-zero) value, the move is obstructed.\n4.  **Move or don't move:**\n    *   If there are *no* obstructions (all target cells are blank), move the entire \"yellow\\_block\" to the target positions, setting the original positions in the bottom row to blank (0).\n    *   If there *is* any obstruction, the entire \"yellow\\_block\" *does not move*. Leave the input grid unchanged.\n5. Return the modified grid (or the original if no move occurred).\n\n"
