The input grid appears to be replicated and embedded within a larger grid filled mostly with zeros (white). The original grid's spatial relationships seem to be preserved in its copies.  There's a clear pattern of replication and embedding, suggesting geometric manipulation and object persistence.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
