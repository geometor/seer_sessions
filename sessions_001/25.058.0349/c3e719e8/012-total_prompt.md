## Example 3

**input:**
```
6 9 9
4 6 8
9 9 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911E9AE210>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 6 9 9 6 9 9
0 0 0 4 6 8 4 6 8
0 0 0 9 9 8 9 9 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
6 9 9 6 9 9 0 0 0
4 6 8 4 6 8 0 0 0
9 9 8 9 9 8 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x76911EE1F750>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grid appears to be replicated and embedded within a larger grid filled mostly with zeros (white). The original grid's spatial relationships seem to be preserved in its copies.  There's a clear pattern of replication and embedding, suggesting geometric manipulation and object persistence.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - values: [6, 9, 9, 4, 6, 8, 9, 9, 8]  # Values from the provided example
    actions:
      - replicated: 2x2 times
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - background_color: 0 (white)
    relationships:
      - contains: input_grid (replicated copies)
      - padding: 3 rows on top, 3 columns to the left, and 3 rows in between the replications

  - action: replication
    details:
      - The input grid is copied.
      - Copies are placed with specific offsets.

  - action: embedding
    details:
      -  Replicated grids are placed within the larger output grid.
      -  Specific padding defines the locations of the copies.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled with 0s (white).

2. **Replication and Placement:** Create two additional rows and columns of the original input.
    -   Copy the entire input grid.
    -   Place the original in the top-left, at an x-offset of 3 and a y-offset of 0.
    -    Place another in the top-right, at an x-offset of 6 and a y-offset of 0.
    -   Place the third copy at an x-offset of 3, y-offset of 6
    -   Place the forth copy at x-offset of 6, y-offset of 6.

3. **Output:** The resulting 9x9 grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
