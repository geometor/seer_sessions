Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is replicated four times and positioned at four corners in a 9x9 output grid, with 3x3 blocks of '0' inserted between and around the 3x3 pattern to expand the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as 9x9 filled with 0s
    output_grid = np.zeros((9, 9), dtype=int)

    # Get input grid dimensions
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Place the input grid in the top-left corner
    output_grid[:input_height, :input_width] = input_grid

    # Place the input grid in the top-right corner
    output_grid[:input_height, 6:9] = input_grid

    # Place the input grid in the bottom-left corner
    output_grid[6:9, :input_width] = input_grid
    
    # place the input grid in the bottom-right corner
    output_grid[6:9,6:9] = input_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
