## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 8 7
9 3 8
7 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911E9AE210>

**output:**
```
3 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0
9 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
7 9 3 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 3 8 7 0 0 0
0 0 0 9 3 8 0 0 0
0 0 0 7 9 3 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 7
0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 7 9 3
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) of colored numbers into a larger grid (9x9) of colored numbers. The original grid appears to be replicated and tiled within the larger grid, with the remaining cells filled with zeros (white). The tiling seems to follow a specific pattern, creating a 3x3 repetition of the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - contains distinct colored regions
      - each cell has a single color

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
      - contains the input_grid replicated
      - majority of cells are color 0 (white)
    relationships:
        - output_grid is a tiled replication of input_grid

  - action: replication
    description: The input grid is copied multiple times.

  - action: tiling
    description: The replicated input grids are arranged in a 3x3 pattern within output grid.

  - action: filling
    description: Remaining cells in output_grid are filled with 0.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Replicate:** Create nine copies of the input grid.
2. **Tile:** Arrange the nine copies in a 3x3 grid pattern to form a larger 9x9 grid.
3. **Fill:** Fill any remaining (empty) cells in the resulting 9x9 grid with the value 0 (representing white).

This process effectively creates a larger grid where the original input is repeated diagonally.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
