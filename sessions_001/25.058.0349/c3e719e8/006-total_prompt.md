## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 6 8
3 3 8
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x76911EB26350>

**output:**
```
8 6 8 0 0 0 8 6 8
3 3 8 0 0 0 3 3 8
8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 6 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 8
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8
8 6 8 8 6 8 8 6 8
3 3 8 3 3 8 3 3 8

```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid containing digits representing colors.  The colors are predominantly azure (8), with some green (3) and magenta (6).  The input appears to be a small, distinct object or pattern.
*   **Output:** A 9x9 grid. It appears the original 3x3 input grid is replicated and combined with areas of white (0). Specifically, the original input appears in the top-left, then a 3x3 block of white, and the input repeats in the top-right. This pattern repeats. The original input is present at the top-left corner, top-right corner, bottom-left corner, and bottom-right.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a patterned replication and insertion of empty space.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color_values: [0-9]  # Representing color codes
        dominant_color: 8  # Azure
        other_colors: [3, 6] # Green, Magenta
    properties:
      - static: true # The input grid itself doesn't change internally

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements:
      - color_values: [0-9]
        dominant_color: 0,8
    properties:
      - pattern: replicated_input
      - padding: white_space

actions:
    - name: replicate
      agent: input_grid
      target: output_grid
      parameters:
          - replication_factor_x: 3
          - replication_factor_y: 3
          - padding_color: 0
          - padding_size: 3x3

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: output_grid
    to: input_grid
    properties:
      - count: 4 # input appears 4 times at each corner.
      - positions: ['top-left','top-right','bottom-left', 'bottom-right']

  - type: padded_with
    from: input_grid # replicated input
    to: output_grid
    properties:
        - padding_element: zero_grid
        - padding_dimensions: 3x3

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled with white (0).
2. **Replication with Padding** Take the original input grid, duplicate it, and include white spaces. Create four copies of the original 3x3.
3.  **Placement:** Place the original 3x3 grid in the top-left corner of the output grid.
4. **Insert Padding:** Create a 3 x 3 block filled with zeros.
5. **Arrangement:**
   - Place the duplicate 3x3 to the right of the padding.
   - Below create one more row by placing the 3x3 padding first, and the original 3x3 to its right.
6. **Bottom Row Copy:** Copy and place the original input at the bottom left of the 9x9. Add padding to the right.
7. **Bottom Right Copy**: Copy and place the original input grid to the bottom right of the 9 x 9.

In essence, the input grid is replicated four times and positioned at four corners in the output grid, with 3x3 blocks of '0' inserted between and around the 3x3 pattern to expand the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
