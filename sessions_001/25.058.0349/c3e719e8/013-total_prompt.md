Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Initialization:** Create a 9x9 output grid filled with 0s (white).

2. **Replication and Placement:** Create two additional rows and columns of the original input.
    -   Copy the entire input grid.
    -   Place the original in the top-left, at an x-offset of 3 and a y-offset of 0.
    -    Place another in the top-right, at an x-offset of 6 and a y-offset of 0.
    -   Place the third copy at an x-offset of 3, y-offset of 6
    -   Place the forth copy at x-offset of 6, y-offset of 6.

3. **Output:** The resulting 9x9 grid is the output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
