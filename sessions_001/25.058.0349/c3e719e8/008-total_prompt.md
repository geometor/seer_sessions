Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is replicated four times and positioned at four corners in a 9x9 output grid, with 3x3 blocks of '0' inserted between and around the 3x3 pattern to expand the output.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as 9x9 filled with 0s
    output_grid = np.zeros((9, 9), dtype=int)

    # Get input grid dimensions
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Place the input grid in the top-left corner
    output_grid[:input_height, :input_width] = input_grid

    # Place the input grid in the top-right corner
    output_grid[:input_height, 6:9] = input_grid

    # Place the input grid in the bottom-left corner
    output_grid[6:9, :input_width] = input_grid
    
    # place the input grid in the bottom-right corner
    output_grid[6:9,6:9] = input_grid
    

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved replicating a 3x3 input grid four times in a 9x9 output grid. This worked perfectly for the first example. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this approach is too specific and doesn't generalize. The input grids are not always 3x3, and the output grid's size and structure are not always a simple 9x9 replication. The core concept of replication is present, but the specifics of placement and output grid size need to be adaptive based on the input.

The strategy to resolve the errors is to:

1.  **Analyze Input-Output Dimensions:** Determine the relationship between the input and output grid dimensions for each example.
2.  **Identify Replication Pattern:** Figure out how many times the input grid is replicated and how it's positioned. There's a clear pattern of mirroring/reflection and spacing around it.
3.  **Parameterize the Transformation:** Instead of hardcoding 9x9 and offsets like 6, the code needs to calculate these values dynamically based on input dimensions.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**
I will derive a report of the heights and widths using code execution.

import numpy as np

# Define the input and output grids for all examples
train_examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]),
        "output": np.array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]]),

    {

        "output": np.array([[5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5]]),

        "output": np.array([[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 2]]),
    },
]

# Create a list to store the dimensions
dimensions = []

# loop through train_examples
for example in train_examples:
    input_grid = example["input"]
    output_grid = example["output"]
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = output_grid.shape
    dimensions.append(
        {
            "input_height": input_height,
            "input_width": input_width,
            "output_height": output_height,
            "output_width": output_width,
        }
    )

# print dimensions report
for i, dims in enumerate(dimensions):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input:  Height={dims['input_height']}, Width={dims['input_width']}")
    print(f"  Output: Height={dims['output_height']}, Width={dims['output_width']}")
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
