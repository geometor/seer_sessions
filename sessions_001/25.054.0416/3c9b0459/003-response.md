Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program ("The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise") and the corresponding Python code (`np.rot90(input_array, k=1)`) are *incorrect*. While the code *does* perform a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, the provided examples demonstrate a different transformation. It's not a simple rotation. The code works for the dimensions, but not the content, as shown by "pixels_off". A core misunderstanding is present. We must re-evaluate the transformation.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Abandon Rotation:** The core assumption of rotation is flawed. We need to discard this and look for a new pattern.
2.  **Pixel-Level Analysis:** Instead of treating the entire grid as one object, we need to analyze how *individual pixels* or *small groups of pixels* are moving or changing.
3.  **Focus on Input-Output Pairs:** Meticulously compare each input grid to its corresponding output grid, cell by cell.
4.  **Consider Mirroring/Reflection:** The examples look visually like some kind of mirroring or reflection, perhaps along a diagonal, rather than a rotation.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I'll create a brief summary for each example, focusing on potential mirroring/reflection.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input `2 2 1 / 2 1 2 / 2 8 1`
    *   Output `1 8 2 / 2 1 2 / 1 2 2`
    *   Observation: Appears like a reflection across the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `9 2 4 / 2 4 4 / 2 9 2`
    *   Output: `2 9 2 / 4 4 2 / 4 2 9`
    *   Observation: Also seems like a reflection across the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: `8 8 8 / 5 5 8 / 8 5 5`
    *    Output: `5 5 8 / 8 5 5 / 8 8 8`
    *    Observation: Consistent with a top-left to bottom-right diagonal reflection.

*   **Example 4:**
    *    Input: `3 2 9 / 9 9 9 / 2 3 3`
    *    Output: `3 3 2 / 9 9 9 / 9 2 3`
    *    Observation: Consistent with a top-left to bottom-right diagonal reflection.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_002:
  objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        dimensions: 3x3
        elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  transformations:
    - action: reflection
      axis: top-left to bottom-right diagonal
      description: Each element's position is swapped with its corresponding element across the main diagonal.
  examples:
    - example_1:
      input:  [[2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 8, 1]]
      output: [[1, 2, 1], [8, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2]]
      result: pixels_off: 4
    - example_2:
        input: [[9, 2, 4], [2, 4, 4], [2, 9, 2]]
        output: [[4, 4, 2], [2, 4, 9], [9, 2, 2]]
        result: pixels_off: 6
    - example_3:
      input:  [[8, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5]]
      output: [[8, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8]]
      result: pixels_off: 4
    - example_4:
      input: [[3, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9], [2, 3, 3]]
      output: [[9, 9, 3], [2, 9, 3], [3, 9, 2]]
      result: pixels_off: 8
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is reflected across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).  This means the element at position (i, j) in the input grid is moved to position (j, i) in the output grid. This is equivalent to a matrix transposition.
