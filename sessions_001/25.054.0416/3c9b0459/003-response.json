            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise\") and the corresponding Python code (`np.rot90(input_array, k=1)`) are *incorrect*. While the code *does* perform a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, the provided examples demonstrate a different transformation. It's not a simple rotation. The code works for the dimensions, but not the content, as shown by \"pixels_off\". A core misunderstanding is present. We must re-evaluate the transformation.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Abandon Rotation:** The core assumption of rotation is flawed. We need to discard this and look for a new pattern.\n2.  **Pixel-Level Analysis:** Instead of treating the entire grid as one object, we need to analyze how *individual pixels* or *small groups of pixels* are moving or changing.\n3.  **Focus on Input-Output Pairs:** Meticulously compare each input grid to its corresponding output grid, cell by cell.\n4.  **Consider Mirroring/Reflection:** The examples look visually like some kind of mirroring or reflection, perhaps along a diagonal, rather than a rotation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nI'll create a brief summary for each example, focusing on potential mirroring/reflection.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input `2 2 1 / 2 1 2 / 2 8 1`\n    *   Output `1 8 2 / 2 1 2 / 1 2 2`\n    *   Observation: Appears like a reflection across the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `9 2 4 / 2 4 4 / 2 9 2`\n    *   Output: `2 9 2 / 4 4 2 / 4 2 9`\n    *   Observation: Also seems like a reflection across the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input: `8 8 8 / 5 5 8 / 8 5 5`\n    *    Output: `5 5 8 / 8 5 5 / 8 8 8`\n    *    Observation: Consistent with a top-left to bottom-right diagonal reflection.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *    Input: `3 2 9 / 9 9 9 / 2 3 3`\n    *    Output: `3 3 2 / 9 9 9 / 9 2 3`\n    *    Observation: Consistent with a top-left to bottom-right diagonal reflection.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_002:\n  objects:\n    - type: grid\n      properties:\n        dimensions: 3x3\n        elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n  transformations:\n    - action: reflection\n      axis: top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n      description: Each element's position is swapped with its corresponding element across the main diagonal.\n  examples:\n    - example_1:\n      input:  [[2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [2, 8, 1]]\n      output: [[1, 2, 1], [8, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2]]\n      result: pixels_off: 4\n    - example_2:\n        input: [[9, 2, 4], [2, 4, 4], [2, 9, 2]]\n        output: [[4, 4, 2], [2, 4, 9], [9, 2, 2]]\n        result: pixels_off: 6\n    - example_3:\n      input:  [[8, 8, 8], [5, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5]]\n      output: [[8, 5, 8], [8, 5, 5], [8, 8, 8]]\n      result: pixels_off: 4\n    - example_4:\n      input: [[3, 2, 9], [9, 9, 9], [2, 3, 3]]\n      output: [[9, 9, 3], [2, 9, 3], [3, 9, 2]]\n      result: pixels_off: 8\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input grid is reflected across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).  This means the element at position (i, j) in the input grid is moved to position (j, i) in the output grid. This is equivalent to a matrix transposition.\n"
