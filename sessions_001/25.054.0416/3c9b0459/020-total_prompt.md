# Example

**input:**
```
3 2 9
9 9 9
2 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C764B9D0>

**output:**
```
3 3 2
9 9 9
9 2 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C764B880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a color. The transformation appears to involve a rearrangement of the elements within the grid, specifically a swapping of certain cell values. There is no apparent creation or deletion of values, only a change in their position. The colors remain constant; that is, the numbers keep mapping to the same colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_property: color
  - action: swap
    description: "Positions of certain elements are interchanged."
    affected_elements:
      - element1:
          value_input: 2
          position_input: [0,1]
          value_output: 3
          position_output: [0,1]
      - element2:
          value_input: 3
          position_input: [0,0]
          value_output: 3
          position_output: [0,0]
      - element3:
          value_input: 2
          position_input: [2,0]
          value_output: 9
          position_output: [2, 0]
      - element4:
        value_input: 9
        position_input: [2,1]
        value_output: 2
        position_output: [2,1]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate the cell at position (0, 0) and observe its values.
2.  **Identify:** Locate the cell at position (0, 1). The value of this cell on the input grid is swapped with the value of the cell (2,1) on the output grid.
3. **Identify:** Locate the cell at position (2, 0). The value of this cell is swapped with the cell in position (2,1)
4.  **Preserve all other cells:** Maintain all other cell's positions and their values, including the entire second row.

In short the program takes cell (0,1) and puts its value in cell (2,1). Then it moves the old (2,1) and places it in (2,0). Finally, the old (2,0) is placed in (0,1).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
