# Example

**input:**
```
9 2 4
2 4 4
2 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C764B9D0>

**output:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 2
4 2 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C764B880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation appears to be a manipulation of the grid's positions, not a change in the colors themselves. The overall structure (3x3 grid) is preserved. It's a spatial rearrangement.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped to integer values
      - position: row and column indices

actions:
  - type: spatial transformation
    description: rearrangement of grid elements
    details:  Specific pattern needs to be determined. Likely a rotation, reflection or combination.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: elements have positions relative to each other within the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid. Elements maintain their color, each moving to their corresponding new location as dictated by the rotation.

1.  The top-left element moves to the top-right position.
2.  The top-center element moves to the right-center position.
3. The top-right moves to the bottom-right
4. the original middle row rotates and becomes the new right column
5. original right column rotates and becomes the new bottom row, reading from
   right to left.

The entire grid rotates 90 clockwise, essentially transposing and reversing the columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
