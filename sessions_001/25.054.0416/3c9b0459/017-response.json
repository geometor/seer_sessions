            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempted to create specific transformations for each example, identified by an `example_id`. This approach is fundamentally flawed because it doesn't generalize. The task requires a *single* transformation rule that works for *all* examples, not a different rule per example. The results clearly show that the code fails on all four training examples because it's only performing the actions related to the `example_id` provided, and in each case, we are defaulting to doing nothing (returning input). We need to identify the *common* pattern, if any, across all input-output pairs. The comment on the code is not a valid natural language program as it lists the example differences.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Discard `example_id`:** The idea of separate transformations per example is incorrect. We must find a unified rule.\n2. **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully look at all input/output pairs again, side-by-side, to discern a common pattern. The initial attempt to hardcode the transformations made it hard to identify the true underlying transformation.\n3. **Focus on Row Manipulations:** The earlier observations correctly hinted at row operations (swapping, reversing, shifting). We need to determine the *precise* row operation that is consistent across *all* examples.\n4. **Verify the new rule** on each input to see if they can be unified into a single rule.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (using manual inspection, code execution not necessary for this simple case):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid\n    *   Output: Rows appear to be cyclically shifted upwards. Row 1 becomes Row 3, Row 2 becomes Row 1, Row 3 becomes Row 2.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid\n    *   Output: Rows appear to be cyclically shifted upwards. Row 1 becomes Row 3, Row 2 becomes Row 1, Row 3 becomes Row 2.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid\n    *   Output: Rows appear to be cyclically shifted upwards. Row 1 becomes Row 3, Row 2 becomes Row 1, Row 3 becomes Row 2.\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid\n    *   Output: Rows appear to be cyclically shifted upwards. Row 1 becomes Row 3, Row 2 becomes Row 1, Row 3 becomes Row 2.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: 3\n      columns: 3\n      elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n    transformations:\n      - type: row_shift\n        description: Cyclic upward shift of rows.\n        details: |\n            The first row becomes the last row.\n            The second row becomes the first row.\n            The third row becomes the second row.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is a cyclic upward shift of the rows of the input grid. The first row becomes the last row, the second row becomes the first row, and so on. In general terms, for an input grid of *n* rows, the row at index *i* in the output grid is the row at index *(i+1) mod n* in the input grid.\n"
