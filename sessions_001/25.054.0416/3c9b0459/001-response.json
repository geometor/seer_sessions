Each integer represents a color. The transformation seems to involve a rotation or reflection of the grid, as the relative positions of the numbers change. Specifically, it appears the grid is rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise. The colors (represented by integers) remain consistent between the input and output; only their positions change.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

No colors are added, removed, or changed, and the relative relationships, only its orientation, is changed.\n\nThat's my current assessment.
