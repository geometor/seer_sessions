# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 8 0
0 8 0 8
0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7C67C740DD80>

**output:**
```
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
0 8 0 8 8 0 8 0
0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x384 at 0x7C67C740EC20>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0) and azure (8). The input grid is smaller (3x4) than the output grid (6x8). The azure pixels appear to be the focus of the transformation, with the white pixels acting as background. The transformation seems to involve some kind of expansion or duplication of the azure pixels.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - input_shape: 3x4
      - output_shape: 6x8
    relations:
      - input grid transforms to output grid
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (0) or azure (8)
    actions:
      - azure pixels are duplicated and shifted
    relations:
      - pixels form the grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Duplicate:** For each azure pixel, create a duplicate.
3.  **Expand:** Double the input dimensions. The original input height and with are multipled by two to create the output.
4.  **Position original:** insert the input grid into the output grid, starting at coordinates 0,0 and repeated at offsets from the origin of +0,+4, then +3,+0 and +3,+4.

In summary - the output duplicates the input four times, combining them into a larger grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
