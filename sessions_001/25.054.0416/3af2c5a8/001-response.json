The primary colors involved are white (0) and azure (8). The input grid is smaller (3x4) than the output grid (6x8). The azure pixels appear to be the focus of the transformation, with the white pixels acting as background. The transformation seems to involve some kind of expansion or duplication of the azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The original input height and with are multipled by two to create the output.\n4.  **Position original:** insert the input grid into the output grid, starting at coordinates 0,0 and repeated at offsets from the origin of +0,+4, then +3,+0 and +3,+4.\n\nIn summary - the output duplicates the input four times, combining them into a larger grid.\n"
