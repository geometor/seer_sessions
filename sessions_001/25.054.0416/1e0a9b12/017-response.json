            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the results, and updated documentation:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program (\"Pixels of certain colors move downwards until they encounter another non-zero pixel or the bottom of the grid. Pixels in lower rows have precedence.\") was a good starting point, but the execution results reveal a flaw in the implementation. The code doesn't correctly handle the \"stacking\" of pixels. When a pixel moves down, it doesn't always stop *immediately* above the obstacle; sometimes, it stops earlier, leaving gaps. The core issue seems to be in the `can_move_down` and the loop in the main `transform` function, which are meant to perform the stacking logic.\n\nThe main strategy to fix this is to re-examine the movement logic to determine the actual lowest valid space, instead of the first empty space found.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\nHere is the information in a structured report.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Size: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Size: (4, 4)\n    *   Pixels Off: 3\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Notes: The yellow (4) in the top row and the blue (1) stays in place, 6 and 9 drop to the bottom.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Size: (6, 6)\n    *   Output Size: (6, 6)\n    *   Pixels Off: 4\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Notes:  The azure (8) does not stack correctly on top of the other 8. Similarly, the 9 doesn't stack on top of the other numbers.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Size: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Size: (5, 5)\n    *   Pixels Off: 5\n    *   Match: False\n    *   Notes: The second green (3) from the top remains in place, the other green stacks, the 1 stacks correctly, but the top 1 does not. The red(2) stacks correctly.\n\n**YAML Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  objects:\n    - type: pixel\n      properties:\n        color:\n          - white (0)\n          - blue (1)\n          - red (2)\n          - green (3)\n          - yellow (4)\n          - gray (6)\n          - orange (8)\n          - maroon (9)\n        movable: true  # All non-white pixels are movable\n        position: [row, col]\n  actions:\n    - name: move_down\n      description: |\n        Pixels move down one cell at a time within their column.\n        Movement continues until the pixel reaches the bottom of the grid or\n        encounters a non-white pixel directly beneath it.\n      constraints:\n        - Only non-white pixels can move.\n        - Pixels move within their original column.\n        - bottom-most pixels move first.\n  global_transformation:\n    description: |\n        All non-white pixels move down as far as possible in their respective\n        columns, stacking on top of other non-white pixels or stopping at\n        the bottom of the grid, with precedence to lower pixels.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Movable Pixels:** Find all pixels that are not white (color value 0).\n\n2.  **Prioritize by Row:** Sort the movable pixels by their row index, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards (descending order).\n\n3.  **Move Downwards:** For each movable pixel, iterate downwards within its column.\n    *   Find the lowest available position:\n        The position must be white, and either the next position below is\n        non-white, or the current position is already on the bottom row.\n    *   Move the pixel to that lowest available position in the column.\n\n4.  **Output:** The final grid after all movable pixels have been processed represents the transformed output.\n"
