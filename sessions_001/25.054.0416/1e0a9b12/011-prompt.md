"""
1.  **Identify Key Rows:** Disregard any rows from the input that *only* contains white(0) pixels or yellow (4).
2.  **Combine and Reorder**:
    *   All remaining rows are to be combined, from bottom to top.
    *   The bottom three rows will become the new bottom three rows.
    *  Colors are appended in their relative positions.
3.  **Fill Remaining Space:** Any rows not filled by the shifted rows at the top are filled with white (0) pixels.
4. **Special Color Handling:** If the row consists of colors other than 0:
    * If there's a '9' (maroon), it is moved to the last column in the combined result.
    * Colors like 1 (blue), and 6 (magenta) may shift their relative horizontal position within the combined row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
