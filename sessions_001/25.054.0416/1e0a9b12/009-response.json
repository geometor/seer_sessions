            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the results, and an updated natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy was partially correct in identifying persistent objects (the yellow block) and a moving object (the maroon pixel). However, it failed to correctly generalize the movement and transformation rules across all examples. Specifically, it:\n\n1.  Incorrectly assumed the maroon pixel *always* moves to the bottom-right.\n2.  Failed to account for other color transformations and movements of other objects. The prediction of the azure and orange pixels was not generalized.\n3.  Didn't capture the overall pattern of row shifting and merging that's occurring.\n\nThe key to solving this is to focus less on absolute positions (like \"bottom-right\") and more on relative movements and interactions between objects within the grid. The row shifting and merging based on color and vertical position.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Example Reports:**\n\nTo accurately report on what's happening, I need to programmatically analyze the differences. Since I don't have code execution capabilities within this turn. I cannot use previous turns code. I will report by comparing the input, expected output and the transformed output.\n\n**Example 1 Report:**\n\n*   **Input vs. Expected Output:** The bottom row of the input is moved to replace the top row of the output. The magenta 6 is to the left of other values in the input, but to the right in the output. All instances of 4 (yellow) are removed except in the first column.\n*\t**Transformed vs Expected**: It appears we are only processing color 4, 9, and 0. Also of note is that we did not predict the 6, or the 1.\n\n**Example 2 Report:**\n\n*   **Input vs. Expected Output:** The bottom three rows of the input become the bottom three rows of the output, with the maroon 9 appended. An 8 in the second row does not appear in the output.\n*\t**Transformed vs Expected**: It appears we are only processing color 4, 7, 8, 9, and 0. Also of note is that the second row's 8 has been handled correctly in the transform, but it still not a perfect match.\n\n**Example 3 Report:**\n\n*   **Input vs. Expected Output:** The bottom three rows of the input become the bottom three rows of the output, with the second to bottom row of the input moving up one row in the output. The top two rows of the output are all 0.\n*\t**Transformed vs Expected**: Our transform predicts an entirely blank grid. This means none of our rules for handling colours other than 0 were applied.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      persistent_objects: []\n      moving_objects:\n        - color: 9  # Maroon\n          initial_position: top_right\n          final_position_relative: bottom_row_append\n        - color: 1\n          initial_position: bottom_left\n          final_position_relative: prepended to bottom row\n        - color: 6\n          initial_position: mid_left\n          final_position_relative: prepended to bottom row\n      transformations:\n        - type: row_shift_and_merge\n          description: Bottom rows of the input, containing colors other than 0 or the initial yellow, replace existing rows, moving up and merging by appending.\n          affected_rows: bottom_row_to_top\n  - example_2:\n      persistent_objects: []\n      moving_objects:\n        - color: 9\n          initial_position: top_right\n          final_position_relative: bottom_row_append\n      transformations:\n        - type: row_shift_and_merge\n          description: Bottom rows containing specific colors move upwards, replacing existing rows, with the final row appending elements.\n          affected_rows: bottom_three_rows\n  - example_3:\n      persistent_objects: []\n      moving_objects:\n          - color: 6\n            initial_position: bottom_left\n            final_position_relative: bottom_row_prepend\n          - color: 2\n            initial_position: third_row_right\n            final_position_relative: bottom_row_append\n      transformations:\n        - type: row_shift_and_merge\n          description: combines the non-zero and non-yellow rows.\n          affected_rows: last_three_rows\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Rows:** Disregard any rows from the input that *only* contains white(0) pixels or yellow (4).\n2.  **Combine and Reorder**:\n    *   All remaining rows are to be combined, from bottom to top.\n    *   The bottom three rows will become the new bottom three rows.\n    *  Colors are appended in their relative positions.\n3.  **Fill Remaining Space:** Any rows not filled by the shifted rows at the top are filled with white (0) pixels.\n4. **Special Color Handling:** If the row consists of colors other than 0:\n    * If there's a '9' (maroon), it is moved to the last column in the combined result.\n    * Colors like 1 (blue), and 6 (magenta) may shift their relative horizontal position within the combined row.\n\nThis program focuses on the *relative* row operations and merging, which seems to be the core logic, rather than fixed positions. It also acknowledges special handling for some colors.\n"
