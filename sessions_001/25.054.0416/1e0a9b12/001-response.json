The input grid contains single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grid appears to be a rearrangement of some of the input grid's elements. Some elements are removed and the locations of other elements are changed. The most notable change is that many non-zero elements have moved to the bottom row.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
