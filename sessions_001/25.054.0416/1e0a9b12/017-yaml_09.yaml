        Pixels move down one cell at a time within their column.
        Movement continues until the pixel reaches the bottom of the grid or
        encounters a non-white pixel directly beneath it.
      constraints:
        - Only non-white pixels can move.
        - Pixels move within their original column.
        - bottom-most pixels move first.

        All non-white pixels move down as far as possible in their respective
        columns, stacking on top of other non-white pixels or stopping at
        the bottom of the grid, with precedence to lower pixels.
