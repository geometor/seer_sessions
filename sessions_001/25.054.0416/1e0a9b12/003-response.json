            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the errors, a strategy for resolving them, and updated documentation:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code have a fundamental flaw: they assume the number of non-zero elements will always be less than or equal to the width of the input grid. The error messages \"could not broadcast input array from shape (x,) into shape (y,)\" clearly indicate this. The number of non-zero elements (`x`) exceeds the width of the output grid (`y`), causing the broadcasting to fail. The output grid size must match the input grid size and we need to move the nonzero elements to the last row *while shifting other rows upwards*.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Count Non-zero Elements:** Determine the number of non-zero elements.\n2.  **Match Output Size:** Ensure that the output array dimensions are the same as the input.\n3.  **Shift and Place:** Place the non-zero elements, in order, on the *last* row. All other cells on the last row must be zero. All rows must shift up a number of rows equal to the number of rows containing a nonzero element.\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nWe'll use a consistent format for each example to highlight the crucial information. I won't use `code_execution` here since I'm focusing on *understanding* the rule, not generating code.  The provided python traceback is sufficient information.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Non-zero Count: 5\n    *   Error: `could not broadcast input array from shape (5,) into shape (4,)`\n    *   Notes: The number of non-zero elements exceeds the grid width.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (6, 6)\n    *   Non-zero Count: 8\n    *   Error: `could not broadcast input array from shape (8,) into shape (6,)`\n    *   Notes: Same error as Example 1.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Output Shape: (5, 5)\n    *   Non-zero Count: 7\n    *   Error: `could not broadcast input array from shape (7,) into shape (5,)`\n    *   Notes: Same error as Example 1.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 63613498\nsummary: |\n  Non-zero elements are extracted and placed in order on the last row of the output grid.

Any remaining spaces on the last row should be filled with zeros.\n"
