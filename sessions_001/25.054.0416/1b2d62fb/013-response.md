Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into a smaller grid. The input grid seems to have a pattern involving the colors maroon (9), white (0), and blue (1). The output grid uses only white (0) and azure (8).  The key seems to be the blue (1) pixels in the input. The position of the blue pixels in the input is reflected in the output by the placement of azure pixels on a white background. The output grid is smaller (5x3) than the input grid (5x7). The azure (8) pixels in the output correspond to the locations of the blue (1) pixels in the input, relative to the full input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [maroon, white, blue]
      - dimensions: 5x7
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, azure]
      - dimensions: 5x3
  - name: blue_pixels
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: blue
      - location: input_grid
      - role: key_indicator
  - name: azure_pixels
    type: object_group
    properties:
      - color: azure
      - location: output_grid
      - role: output_representation
actions:
  - name: map_positions
    description: Map blue pixel positions in input grid to azure pixel positions in output grid.
  - name: reduce_size
    description: Reduce the grid size from 5x7 to 5x3.
relationships:
  - type: spatial_correspondence
    from: blue_pixels
    to: azure_pixels
    description: Azure pixels in the output grid mirror the relative positions of blue pixels in the input grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Element:** Locate all blue (1) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Reduce Dimensions:** Create an output grid of size 5x3. Initialize all the pixels in the output grid to be colored white (0).
3.  **Map and Transform:** For each blue pixel in the input grid, calculate it's x position as `x // 2`, and then calculate it's y position using `y // 2`. Transform the corresponding pixel in the output grid at calculated (x, y) coordinates to azure (8). Note, `//` is integer division.
4. **Output Result** Output the new grid.
