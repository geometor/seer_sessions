  - objects:
      - name: input_grid
        type: grid
        properties:
          - contains a vertical line of blue pixels
          - contains other single pixels of other colors

      - name: output_grid
        type: grid
        properties:
          - size: 5x3
          - colors: contains only black and azure pixels
          - shape: related to the relative position of colored pixels adjacent
            to vertical blue line in input_grid

  - observations:
      - The output grid is always 5x3.
      - The output grid contains only black (0) and azure (8) pixels.
      - The vertical blue (1) line in the input acts as a locator, with other colored pixels used to make the output shape
      - The position of the top blue pixel does not determine the top of the output
      - Input grids containing the same adjacent pixels have the same pattern of azure in the output

  - errors:
    - The existing program does not determine the correct row to center.
