            "text": "Here's a breakdown of the task, the current code's performance, and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy correctly identified the vertical blue line as a key landmark. However, the transformation logic, specifically the handling of non-white ('0') pixels, is inconsistent with many of the provided examples. It appears we have a concept drift between the examples and also there's ambiguity in rule. The code must address the position within the three columns in the selected area.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Region Extraction:** Double-check the logic that copies the 3xN region, to make sure that min and max values do not generate any side-effect\n2.  **Conditional Transformation**: Review of the natural language and examples suggests more nuanced rules:\n    The examples suggest that the transformation of a pixel to azure (8) isn't *solely* based on it not being white, but also on relative position to vertical blue line and the content of input grid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a summary of each example, highlighting key discrepancies:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Blue Line Column | Expected vs. Transformed (Pixels Off) | Key Discrepancy                                                                                                                                                   |\n| :------ | :---------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 13                                    | Many '9' (maroon) pixels expected to become '8' (azure) were not. Also, all pixels are transformed, regardless of the original values                         |\n| 2       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 15                                    | Similar to Example 1, incorrect transformation of '9' pixels.                                                                                                    |\n| 3       | (6, 7)      | 3                | 13                                    | Mix of correct and incorrect transformations. The pattern of '8's isn't consistent.                                                                                 |\n| 4       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 13                                    | Inconsistent transformation. Some 9 become 8, some don't                                                                                                           |\n| 5       | (5, 7)      | 3                | 10                                    | It's not consistent again                                                                                                                                        |\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: The original grid of pixel values.\n  - name: blue_line\n    type: vertical line\n    description: A vertical line of blue (1) pixels.

A vertical line is defined as two or more vertically adjacent pixels of the same color.\n2.  **Define Region of Interest:**  Define a region to the immediate right of the blue line. This region has the same height as the input grid and a width of 3 columns.\n3. **Transformation based on position:**\n    Iterate following cells of the `input_grid`:\n     - `input_grid[i, blue_line_col + 1]`:`output_grid[i,0]`\n     - `input_grid[i, blue_line_col + 2]`:`output_grid[i,1]`\n     - `input_grid[i, blue_line_col + 3]`:`output_grid[i,2]`\n    Check cells of input grid, if not '0', replace the related position at output grid to '8'\n4.  **Output:** Create a new grid (output\\_grid) which is the result of `transform_region`.\n\n"
