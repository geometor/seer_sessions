The input grid seems to have a pattern involving the colors maroon (9), white (0), and blue (1). The output grid uses only white (0) and azure (8).  The key seems to be the blue (1) pixels in the input. The position of the blue pixels in the input is reflected in the output by the placement of azure pixels on a white background. The output grid is smaller (5x3) than the input grid (5x7). The azure (8) pixels in the output correspond to the locations of the blue (1) pixels in the input, relative to the full input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Initialize all the pixels in the output grid to be colored white (0).\n3.  **Map and Transform:** For each blue pixel in the input grid, calculate it's x position as `x // 2`, and then calculate it's y position using `y // 2`. Transform the corresponding pixel in the output grid at calculated (x, y) coordinates to azure (8). Note, `//` is integer division.\n4. **Output Result** Output the new grid.\n\n"
