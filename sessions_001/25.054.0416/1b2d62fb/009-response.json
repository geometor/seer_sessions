However, it fails to accurately reproduce the expected outputs across all examples. The primary issue is that the transformation logic is not just about changing the color - but that cells keep the original color or becomes '8' base on the input.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors involves:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluating the Transformation Rule**: Instead of converting every pixel to Azure, check whether the cell is other than '0'.\n2.  **Output:** The output should contains only the 3 columns.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a summary of observations from each example:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Blue Line Column | Key Observations                                                                                                     |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)        | 3                | output extracts correct region, all not '0' converted to 8.                                                       |\n| 2       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)        | 3                | output extracts correct region, all not '0' converted to 8.                                                   |\n| 3       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)        | 3                | output extracts correct region, all not '0' converted to 8.                                                     |\n| 4       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)        | 3                | output extracts correct region, all not '0' converted to 8.                                                         |\n| 5       | (5, 7)      | (5, 3)        | 3                | output extracts correct region, all not '0' converted to 8.                                                        |\n\n**YAML Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 008\n    examples:\n      - example_id: 1\n        input_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 7)\n            blue_line_col: 3\n            colors: [0, 1, 9]\n        output_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 3)\n            colors: [0, 8]\n        transformations:\n          - find: vertical line of color 1 (blue)\n          - extract: 3-width region to the right of the blue line\n          - modify: change all not '0' color to '8'\n      - example_id: 2\n        input_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 7)\n            blue_line_col: 3\n            colors: [0, 1, 9]\n        output_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 3)\n            colors: [0, 8]\n        transformations:\n          - find: vertical line of color 1 (blue)\n          - extract: 3-width region to the right of the blue line\n          - modify: change all not '0' color to '8'\n      - example_id: 3\n        input_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 7)\n            blue_line_col: 3\n            colors: [0, 1, 9]\n        output_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 3)\n            colors: [0, 8]\n        transformations:\n          - find: vertical line of color 1 (blue)\n          - extract: 3-width region to the right of the blue line\n          - modify: change all not '0' color to '8'\n      - example_id: 4\n        input_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 7)\n            blue_line_col: 3\n            colors: [0, 1, 9]\n        output_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 3)\n            colors: [0, 8]\n        transformations:\n          - find: vertical line of color 1 (blue)\n          - extract: 3-width region to the right of the blue line\n          - modify: change all not '0' color to '8'\n      - example_id: 5\n        input_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 7)\n            blue_line_col: 3\n            colors: [0, 1, 9]\n        output_objects:\n          - type: grid\n            shape: (5, 3)\n            colors: [0, 8]\n        transformations:\n          - find: vertical line of color 1 (blue)\n          - extract: 3-width region to the right of the blue line\n          - modify: change all not '0' color to '8'\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Locate**: Find the vertical line of blue (1) pixels within the input grid.\n2.  **Define Region:** A region of interest will be the same height as input and start from the immediate right of blue line, with width of 3\n3. **Transform**: If the region to extract has cell with value other than '0', change it to '8'.\n4.  **Output**: Create a new grid that represents the extracted region.\n\n"
