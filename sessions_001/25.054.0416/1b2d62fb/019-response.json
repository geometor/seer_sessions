The input grid appears to have a vertical blue stripe in the center, surrounded by varying patterns of maroon and white. The output grid is smaller and seems to focus on a representation of the central stripe, using azure and white pixels. The size and aspect ratio change significantly between input and output. The output grid seems to be extracting and simplifying a core feature (the blue stripe) from the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This is the \"central stripe.\"\n\n2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid has the same height as the input grid.  The output grid's width is 3.\n\n3. **Create the Output Core:** In the output, create a column of azure (8) pixels, corresponding to the position of the central blue column in input. The height of that column is the height of the input grid.\n\n4.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** Fill all pixels to the left and right of this azure column with white pixels (value 0). The result is a 3-column wide output grid focusing on the blue stripe from the input grid, and the blue color is mapped to azure.\n\nIn short, the transformation extracts the central blue stripe from the input, maps the blue color (1) to azure (8), and represents it within a 3-column wide grid, with the rest of the pixels as white(0).\n"
