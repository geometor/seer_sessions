input_objects:
  - color: 0  # White
    description: Background
  - color: 1  # Blue
    description: Input pixels that might determine output azure pixel positions
  - color: 9 # Maroon
    description: unknown

output_objects:
  - color: 0  # White
    description: Background
  - color: 8  # Azure
    description: Output pixels, potentially derived from blue pixel positions

output_grid:
  rows: 5
  cols: 3

transformations:
    - action: "map input pixels to output pixels"
      conditions:
        - "blue pixels in the input grid appear to influence position of azure pixels"
      operations:
        - "output grid is always 5x3"
        - "azure pixel locations vary, and do not appear to correlate to the number of blue pixels"
