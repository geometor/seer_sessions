The input grid appears to have a prominent vertical line of blue (1) pixels in the center. The output grid seems to focus on a small section of the input grid and replaces the blue (1) pixels with azure (8) pixels. The size of the output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. It appears that a specific region is extracted and modified.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The region of extraction seem to correspond with two row below and two rows above the first occurance of blue. The extraction is always 3 wide and is centered on the central feature.\n3.  **Modify colors:** Within this extracted subgrid, locate blue pixels (value 1).\n4.  **Replace Color**: Change value of any pixel with the value of 1 to have a value of 8.\n5.  **Output:** The modified 3x5 subgrid is the output.\n\n"
