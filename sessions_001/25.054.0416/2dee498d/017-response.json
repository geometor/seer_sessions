            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to refine the solution:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were too simplistic. While it correctly handled the first example, it failed on the subsequent examples. The core issue is that the initial program assumed *every* 4th column was selected, and it calculated that incorrectly, leading to picking the wrong set of columns in most cases. The results indicate the rule should select columns based on index of starting point and interval, which is not being applied consistently.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze all three training examples to pinpoint the *exact* column selection rule. It is not enough to observe it for a single example.\n\n2.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to be much more precise about the column selection criteria, likely adjusting the starting index and stride.\n\n3.  **Modify Code:** Update the Python code to reflect the revised natural language program. We will use the second example to guide that update.\n\n4.  **Re-test:** Run the updated code against all training examples and evaluate the results.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including where the current code fails:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: (3, 9)\n    *   Output Shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Columns Kept: 0, 4, 8 (Correct)\n    *   Result: Success\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: (4, 12)\n    *   Output Shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Columns Kept (Expected): 0, 4, 8, 11\n    *   Columns Kept (Current Code): 0, 4, 8\n    *   Result: Failure (Incorrect columns and shape). Missing the last column\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: (2, 6)\n    *   Output Shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Columns Kept (Expected): 0, 3\n    *   Columns Kept (Current Code): 0, 4\n    *   Result: Failure (Incorrect column selection).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\ntask_016:\n  example_1:\n    input_shape: (3, 9)\n    output_shape: (3, 3)\n    rule: \"Keep columns 0, 4, and 8.\"\n    success: True\n  example_2:\n    input_shape: (4, 12)\n    output_shape: (4, 4)\n    rule: \"Keep columns 0, 4, 8, and 11.\"\n    success: False\n  example_3:\n    input_shape: (2, 6)\n    output_shape: (2, 2)\n    rule: \"Keep columns 0 and 3\"\n    success: False\n  overall_rule: \"Keep every 4th column, starting with the first, and includes the LAST column, regardless of interval.\"\n  objects:\n    - grid:\n        properties:\n          - dimensions: rows x columns\n          - values: integers (0-9) representing colors\n        actions:\n          - column_selection: Select specific columns based on a calculated interval and include the final column.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Examine** the input grid to determine its dimensions (number of rows and columns).\n2.  **Create** an output grid with the same number of rows as the input grid.\n3.  **Select Columns:**\n    *   Always include the first column (index 0) of the input grid in the output grid.\n    *   Include every 4th column, after the first column.\n    *   Always include the *last* column of the input grid in the output grid, *regardless* of whether it's part of the every-4th-column rule.\n4. **Copy:** Copy the pixel values of the selected columns from the input grid to the output grid.\n"
