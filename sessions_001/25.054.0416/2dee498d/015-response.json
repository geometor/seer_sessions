            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program was incorrect. It stated that *every other column, starting with the second column* was removed. The results clearly show this is not consistently the case. The transformed output, in all the three given training examples, has removed the alternate columns but in an inconsistent order of starting columns.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is to:\n\n1.  Re-examine the relationship between input and expected output, paying close attention to *which* columns are removed.\n2.  Modify the natural language program to reflect the observed pattern accurately.\n3.  Consider the possibility that there are other transformations, beyond the one selected, that will better predict the expected output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on identifying the precise columns removed:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input shape: (3, 9)\n    *   Expected Output shape: (3, 3)\n    *   Columns removed: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The output is Columns 1, 5. It keeps every 4th column starting at the first.\n    *   Observed output shape: (3,5), Incorrect. Keeps Columns 1,3,5,7 and 9.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input shape: (4, 12)\n    *   Expected Output shape: (4, 4)\n    *   Columns Removed. 2,3,4, 6,7,8, 10,11, and 12. The output is Columns 1, 5, 9. It keeps every 4th column starting at the first.\n    *   Observed output shape: (4,6), Incorrect. Keeps Columns 1,3,5,7,9 and 11.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input shape: (2, 6)\n    *   Expected Output shape: (2, 2)\n    *   Columns Removed: 2,3,4, and 6. The output is Columns 1, 5. It keeps every 4th column, starting at the first.\n    *   Observed output shape: (2,3), Incorrect. Keeps Columns 1,3, and 5.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: \"014\"\n  - objects:\n      - description: \"Input grid\"\n        properties:\n          shape: \"variable\"\n          elements: \"integers 0-9 representing colors\"\n      - description: \"Output grid\"\n        properties:\n          shape: \"derived from input, fewer columns\"\n          elements: \"same as input grid\"\n  - actions:\n      - description: \"Column removal\"\n        details: \"Specific columns are removed from the input grid, maintaining row count.\"\n        rule: \"Keep every 4th column starting from the first\"\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe input grid is transformed into the output grid by keeping every 4th column, starting with the first column. The output grid retains the height (number of rows) of the input grid. The values (colors) in the kept columns are preserved.\n"
