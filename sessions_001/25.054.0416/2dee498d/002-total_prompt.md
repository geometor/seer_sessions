# Example

**input:**
```
4 5 1 1 5 4 4 5 1
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
1 5 4 4 5 1 1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x192 at 0x7C67C764B880>

**output:**
```
4 5 1
5 5 5
1 5 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7C67C74CB0D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares (pixels), where each color is represented by a number. The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a reduction or extraction process. The specific arrangement of colors and their repetition seem crucial to the transformation. The output grid maintains the spatial relationship of colors from the input but reduces the dimensions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (input: 3x9, output: 3x3)
      - elements: colored pixels
      - colors:
        - 1: blue
        - 4: yellow
        - 5: gray
    actions:
      - reduction:  The grid is reduced in size.
    relationships:
      - spatial_preservation: The relative positions of colors are maintained during reduction.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (1, 4, or 5)
      - position: (row, column) within the grid
    actions:
        - selection: specific pixels from input are chosen for output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Core:** Examine the input grid and identify a 3x3 sub-grid that forms the core pattern.
2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Extract this 3x3 sub-grid from the input. The extraction seems to be of every other element along the width of the input grid.
3.  **Output:** The extracted 3x3 sub-grid becomes the output grid.

In essence, the transformation selects a specific 3x3 region from the larger input grid, maintaining the original color arrangement within that region, every other element on the x axis..

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
