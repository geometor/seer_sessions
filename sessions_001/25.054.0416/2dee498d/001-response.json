The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, suggesting a reduction or extraction process. The specific arrangement of colors and their repetition seem crucial to the transformation. The output grid maintains the spatial relationship of colors from the input but reduces the dimensions.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
