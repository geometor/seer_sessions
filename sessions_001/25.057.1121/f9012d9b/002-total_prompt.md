## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 1 2 1 2
1 1 1 1 1
2 1 2 1 2
0 0 1 1 1
0 0 2 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x73D2CE1530D0>

**output:**
```
1 1
2 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x73D2CE1504D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into a smaller grid. The colors in the input grid seem to be reduced in the output, with only blue (1) and red (2) appearing. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid. The presence of white (0) in the input, and its absence in the output, suggests a filtering or selection process. The specific arrangement of blues and reds in the output seems to correspond to a sub-region of the input, but not in a directly positional way. It's more focused on top-left object.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red
      - dimensions: 5x5
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - colors: [1, 2] # blue, red
      - dimensions: 2x2
  - action: filtering
    description: Removes white (0) pixels.
  - action: selection
    description: Selects a sub-region based on unknown criteria that contains all non-zero colors at the top-left of input.
  - relationship: input_to_output
    description: The output is a filtered and selected sub-region of the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize the input as a 2D grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Filter:** Remove all white (0) pixels from the grid.
3.  **Select Top-Left Non-Zero Object:** inspect for first rows and cols that has non-zero.
4.  **Determine Output size:** The output is size of top-left object.
5. **Output results.** Create a new grid containing all values from object.

In summary, the transformation identifies the "core" or minimal representation of non-zero, top-left object and returns it.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
