## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 6 0 6
6 8 6 8
8 6 8 6
6 8 6 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x73D2CE1504D0>

**output:**
```
8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x73D2CDFD3AD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation from a larger grid (4x4) of colored pixels to a single pixel. The colors present in the input grid are azure (8), magenta (6), and white (0). The output grid consists of a single azure (8) pixel. The dominant color in the input grid appears to be related to the output color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [4, 4]
      colors: [8, 6, 0]
      elements:  # representing the individual color blocks
        - color: 8
          count: 5 #manually counted
        - color: 6
          count: 6 #manually counted
        - color: 0
          count: 1 #manually counted
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [1, 1]
      colors: [8]
      elements:
        - color: 8
          count: 1
relations:
  - type: input_to_output
  - subject: input_grid
    predicate: transforms_to
    object: output_grid
actions:
  - type: determine_most_common_color_excluding_white
    input: input_grid
    output: most_common_color

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Analyze the Input:** Examine the input grid and identify all unique colors present.
2.  **Count Occurrences:** Count the number of times each color appears in the input grid.
3. **Ignore white (0):** specifically do not count zero values.
4.  **Determine the next most frequent:** Find the color with the highest count of the remaining.
5.  **Create Output:** Create a 1x1 output grid.
6.  **Set Output Color:** Set the color of the single pixel in the output grid to the second most frequent color identified in the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
