    objects:
      - name: Input Grid
        type: 2D Array
        properties:
          - Contains integer values representing colors.
          - Variable dimensions.
      - name: Output Grid
        type: 2D Array (1x1)
        properties:
          - Contains a single integer value representing a color.
    actions:
      - name: CountColorOccurrences
        description: Counts the occurrences of each color in the input grid, excluding color 0 (white).
      - name: DetermineOutputColor
        description:  If the input grid contains only the color black, the output is black. Otherwise the single color of the grid is the most frequent non-zero color.
      - name: CreateOutputGrid
        description: Creates a 1x1 grid with the determined output color.
    rules:
        - If all the non-zero pixels are of the same color, the output grid will be that color.
        - If there are no non-zero colors, the output is 0.
