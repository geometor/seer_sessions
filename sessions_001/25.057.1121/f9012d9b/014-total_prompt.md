## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 5 5
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
2 2 5 2 2 5 2
5 5 5 5 5 0 0
2 2 5 2 2 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x73D2CE00D950>

**output:**
```
5 5
5 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x73D2CE00D1D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid appears to contain a pattern of red (2) and gray (5) pixels, with some white (0) pixels appearing in the bottom right corner. The output grid seems to be a 2x2 extraction of a specific region from the input, containing a majority of gray pixels and a single red pixel. The location in the source is unclear, but the bottom right and top left seem relevant.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, gray, white]
      dimensions: [7, 7]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, gray]
      dimensions: [2, 2]
  - name: gray_region
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      dominant_color: gray
  - name: red_region
    type: subgrid
    properties:
      dominant_color: red

actions:
  - name: extract
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: A 2x2 region is extracted from the input grid.

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: gray_region, red_region, output_grid
  - type: composition
    description: output is likely a sub-region of the input, located somehow

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Region:** Locate a 2x2 region within the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** extract this region in it's spatial arrangement.
3.  **Output the region:** The program takes this identified 2x2 region and creates it as output. It appears the location is a function of the location and arrangement of like colored pixels.
4. The upper left of the output grid is at row 0, column 2 of input.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
