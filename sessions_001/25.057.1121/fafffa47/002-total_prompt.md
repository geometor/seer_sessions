## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
0 1 0
0 0 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x73D2E83ACB50>

**output:**
```
2 0 0
2 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x73D2CDE701D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid appears to contain two distinct shapes or objects, one composed of maroon (9) pixels and the other of blue (1) pixels, on a white (0) background. The output grid is smaller than the input grid and seems to represent a simplified or abstracted version of a section of the input. Specifically, the output grid contains a red (2) object on white background, and matches shape and position of the maroon shape in the input, in top, left corner. The colors are not consistent between input and output grids. The output only gives us information of the maroon object and ignores other objects.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains two distinct colored regions.
    details:
      - color_1: maroon (9)
        shape_1: irregular, located in the top-left and spanning rows 1-3 and cols 1-3
      - color_2: blue (1)
        shape_2: irregular, located in the bottom-right and spanning rows 4-6 and cols 2-3
      - background_color: white (0)

  - observation: Output grid is smaller than the input grid.
    details:
      - output_size: 3x3
      - input_size: 6x3

  - observation: Output grid contains one colored region.
    details:
        - color: red (2)
          shape: subregion of input grid's maroon region, in the top left corner of input grid.
        - background: white (0)

  - relation: The output grid color is different to its corresponding color region.
    details:
      - maroon maps to: red

  - relation: the output grid includes only the shape in the top, left corner of the input grid
    details:
      - all other parts of the input are ignored.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Object:** Locate the contiguous region of pixels in the top-left corner of the input grid.
2.  **Determine Output Size**: The output size will be a subgrid of the input, that matches the size of this object.
3.  **Translate Color**: Map the color of the target object to the color red (2).
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a new grid with size set in (2). Fill any cell that corresponds with the target object with color red (2). Fill all remaining cells in with white (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
