The input grid appears to contain two distinct shapes or objects, one composed of maroon (9) pixels and the other of blue (1) pixels, on a white (0) background. The output grid is smaller than the input grid and seems to represent a simplified or abstracted version of a section of the input. Specifically, the output grid contains a red (2) object on white background, and matches shape and position of the maroon shape in the input, in top, left corner. The colors are not consistent between input and output grids. The output only gives us information of the maroon object and ignores other objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
