Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves creating a border around the input grid. The output grid's dimensions are determined by adding 2 to both the height and width of the input grid. The input grid is placed in the center of the output grid. The border is constructed by repeating the input grid's border, with special handling to ensure it "connects" seamlessly.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get input grid dimensions
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Calculate output grid dimensions
    output_height = input_height + 2
    output_width = input_width + 2

    # Initialize output_grid with zeros
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # Copy input grid to the center of the output grid
    output_grid[1:input_height+1, 1:input_width+1] = input_grid

    # Create the border

    # Top border (excluding corners)
    output_grid[0, 1:output_width-1] = input_grid[0, :]
    # Bottom border (excluding corners)
    output_grid[output_height-1, 1:output_width-1] = input_grid[input_height-1, :]
    # Left border (excluding corners)
    output_grid[1:output_height-1, 0] = input_grid[:, 0]
    # Right border (excluding corners)
    output_grid[1:output_height-1, output_width-1] = input_grid[:, input_width-1]

    # Corners - very important for seamless connection of the border
    output_grid[0, 0] = input_grid[0, 0]  # Top-left
    output_grid[0, output_width - 1] = input_grid[0, input_width - 1]  # Top-right

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
