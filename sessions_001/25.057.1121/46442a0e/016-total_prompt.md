The input grid is expanded into a larger 6x6 grid. The core 3x3 input is copied to the center.
The border is created from an alternating pattern from the top row and the top right corner of the input.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial `transform` function on the training examples and outline a strategy for improvement.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved expanding a 3x3 grid to a 6x6 grid and creating a border. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this approach is too specific and doesn't generalize. The size of the output grid and the logic for filling the border need to be more flexible and data-driven. It seems that my initial attempt to solve was too literal, and hard coded much of the values. The current code is too simple and it is doing too much.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and the proposed strategy:

1.  **Incorrect Output Size:** The initial code assumes a fixed 6x6 output grid. The other examples show varying output sizes.
    *   **Strategy:** Determine the output grid size dynamically based on the input grid size. The relationship isn't a simple doubling; it varies.

2.  **Incorrect Border Logic:** The border creation logic is hardcoded and based on the first example. It doesn't correctly handle other patterns.
    *   **Strategy:** Analyze the relationship between the input and output borders more carefully. Observe repeating elements, symmetries, or other patterns that can be used to construct the border algorithmically. It may not just be the top row, as initially thought.

3. **Hardcoded copy**: The current system hard coded the position of the input copied to the output.
    * **Strategy**: The copy position needs to be generalized to allow the relative center to move, or allow for borders of varying widths.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

I need to gather some concrete metrics to inform the natural language program and the updated code. I'll focus on:

*   Input grid dimensions.
*   Output grid dimensions.
*   The border pattern, how does it change from the input to the output?
* Does the input appear unchanged, in the output, or is it transformed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
