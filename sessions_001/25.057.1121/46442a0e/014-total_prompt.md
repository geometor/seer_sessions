## Example 3

**input:**
```
6 9 9
6 4 4
6 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x73D2CE00F9D0>

**output:**
```
6 9 9 6 6 6
6 4 4 4 4 9
6 4 4 4 4 9
9 4 4 4 4 6
9 4 4 4 4 6
6 6 6 9 9 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x384 at 0x73D2CE00F450>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger, more complex grid (output). The colors in the input grid appear to be preserved and rearranged in the output grid, suggesting a pattern-based expansion or tiling. The output grid seems to "frame" a core section with the elements from the input. There appears to be some form of mirroring and/or rotation, or a specific layout rule being applied.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [3, 3]
      elements:
        - color: 6 # magenta
          positions: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0]]
        - color: 9 # maroon
          positions: [[0,1], [0,2]]
        - color: 4 # yellow
          positions: [[1,1], [1,2], [2,1], [2,2]]
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [6, 6]
      elements:
        - color: 6 # magenta
          positions: [[0,0], [0,3], [0,4], [0,5], [1,0], [2,0], [3,5], [4,5], [5,0], [5,1], [5,2]]
        - color: 9 # maroon
          positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,5], [2,5], [3,0], [4,0], [5,3], [5,4]]
        - color: 4 # yellow
          positions:  [[1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,1], [2,2], [2,3], [2,4], [3,1], [3,2], [3,3], [3,4], [4,1], [4,2], [4,3], [4,4]]
  - relationships:
      - type: expansion
        description: The input grid's elements are used to construct a larger output grid.
      - type: framing
        description: color 4 is surrounded by color 6 and 9 in some sort of pattern
      - type: contains
        description: The output grid has a subsection that is a copy of input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Elements:** Recognize the distinct colored regions (6, 9, and 4) within the 3x3 input grid.

2.  **Create Output Canvas:** Establish a 6x6 output grid.

3.  **Center Copy:** Copy input grid into the center of output starting at position [1,1].

4.  **Frame with alternating pattern:**
    - place color 6 at [0,0].
    - place color 9 at [0,1].
    - place color 9 at [0,2].
    - place color 6 at [0,3].
    - place color 6 at [0,4].
    - place color 6 at [0,5].
    - place color 6 at [1,0].
    - place color 9 at [1,5].
    - place color 6 at [2,0].
    - place color 9 at [2,5].
    - place color 9 at [3,0].
    - place color 6 at [3,5].
    - place color 9 at [4,0].
    - place color 6 at [4,5].
    - place color 6 at [5,0].
    - place color 6 at [5,1].
    - place color 6 at [5,2].
    - place color 9 at [5,3].
    - place color 9 at [5,4].

This program describes how to take each part of the input, and construct the output using it. The central operation is expanding the input grid by copying the central region, and framing it with the elements from the edges of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
