Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) of colored pixels into a larger grid (6x6). The colors are represented by integers. The primary colors involved seem to be orange (7) and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or duplication of the original grid, with a specific pattern. The output grid seems to be created by outlining.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [7, 8]  # Orange and Azure

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [7, 8] # Orange and Azure

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Doubles the dimensions of the input grid.
  - name: outline
    description: the expanded version of input grid acts as outline that should applied to the result

relationships:
  - input_grid * 2 = output_grid # in term of dimensions, output_grid's each dimension size is 2 times the corresponding dimension of input_grid
  - the expanded version of the input_grid is superimposed on a grid the size of output_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** Take the input grid, the width and height are doubled to find the outline of output shape.
2. **Superimpose:** The expanded input grid is used as an outline.
