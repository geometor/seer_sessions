            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple observation: adding blue pixels to the left and right of azure pixels. However, the test results reveal a flaw in this approach. The code incorrectly adds blue pixels adjacent to *any* azure pixel, regardless of whether it's already adjacent to another azure pixel. It looks like we need a more strict rule, that blue pixels are only placed to the right of a sequence of one or more azure pixels, and to the left of a sequence of one or more azure pixels. It appears only a single blue pixel is added at the boundary of azure pixels sequences, not to each individually.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere's a breakdown of the examples, incorporating a more detailed analysis:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid with azure pixels at (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), and (3,5).\n*   **Expected Output:** Azure pixels remain. Blue pixels at (1,2) and (4,4),\n*   **Transformed Output:** Blue is placed to the left and right of every azure.\n*   **Issues:** The code adds a blue pixel to all sides of all azure pixels, including placing blue on top of azure, and including blue pixels where there should be white pixels.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid.\n*   **Expected Output:** Only placing blue after the end of the sequence\n*   **Transformed Output:** Placing blue adjacent to all azure\n*   **Issues**: Same problem as above\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: \"002\"\nobservations:\n  - object: azure_pixel_sequence\n    properties:\n      - contiguous: \"horizontally\"\n      - color: \"azure\"\n    instances:\n      - example_1: [[1,1], [2,1],[2,2], [3,4], [3,5]]\n      - example_2: [[0, 4], [0,5], [2,2], [3,2], [3,3], [5, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]\n  - object: blue_pixel\n    properties:\n      - color: blue\n    instances:\n      - example_1: [[1,2], [3,4]]\n      - example_2: [[0, 5], [1,4], [2, 3], [5,4], [6,2]]\n  - action: place_blue_pixel\n    description: \"A single blue pixel added to the beginning and end of a sequence of horizontal azure pixels.\"\n    details:\n        - condition: before_sequence\n          action: place to left if available\n        - condition: after_sequence\n          action: place to right if available\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify** all *horizontal sequences* of one or more contiguous azure pixels (value `8`) in the input grid.\n2.  **Preserve** all azure pixels in these sequences in their original positions in the output grid.\n3.  **Introduce** a *single* blue pixel (value `1`) immediately to the right of the *end* of each azure pixel sequence, if there is available space within the grid boundaries.\n4.  **Introduce** a *single* blue pixel (value `1`) immediately to the left of the *start* of each azure pixel sequence, if there is available space within the grid boundaries.\n5.  **Fill** all other positions in the output grid with `0` (white).\n"
