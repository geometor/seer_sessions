facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids are both 4x4."
  - observation: "The grids contain single-digit integers from 0 to 9, representing colors."
  - observation: "The number of each digit is identical in both grids. So no change of values, just positions"
  - observation: "Most of the '0' (white) pixels remain in the same position."
  - observation: "Non-zero pixels mostly change their positions"
  - observation: "The non-zero pixels seem to be moved to the last row."
  - object_identification: "The non-zero digits can be considered as individual objects"
  - action: "The non-zero objects are relocated to the last row maintaining the original column based order."
