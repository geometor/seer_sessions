Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)
        position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
        position: (3,4), (3,5) & (4,5)
  output_grid:
      - object_1:
          color: 8 (azure)
          shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)
          position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2)
      - object_2:
           color: 8 (azure)
           shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
           position: (3,4), (3,5) & (4,5)
      - object_3:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1, 2)
      - object_4:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (4, 4)
```

**Natural Language Description:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** Both azure L-shaped objects from input grid are present in the output grid, in exactly in the same absolute positions.

3. **New object detection**: Two new single-cell blue pixels were added, one between the two cells of the vertical part of the first azure L-shape, and other between the horizontal part of the second azure L-shape

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is to keep the position and shape of L-shapes azure objects, and to add one blue cell to fill their inner empty corner.


```python

Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids for the second example.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)

    - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (straight)
        position: (6,3), (6,4) & (5,4)
  output_grid:
     - object_1:

        position: (0,4), (0,5) & (1,5)
     - object_2:

        shape: L-shape (180 degrees)
        position: (2,2), (3,2) & (3,3)
     - object_3:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (straight)
        position: (6,3), (6,4) & (5,4)
     - object_4:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1, 4)
     - object_5:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (2, 3)
     - object_6:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (5, 3)
```

**Natural Language Description:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify three distinct L-shaped objects, all colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** All three azure L-shaped objects from input grid are present in the output grid, in exactly in the same absolute positions.

3.  **New object detection**: Three new single-cell blue pixels were added, one between the two cells of each of the azure L-shapes.

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is to keep the position and shape of L-shapes azure objects, and to add one blue cell to fill their inner empty corner.

The natural language program, and therefore the python code, is exactly the same as the first example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
