Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)
        position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2)
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
        position: (3,4), (3,5) & (4,5)
  output_grid:
      - object_1:
          color: 8 (azure)
          shape: L-shape (rotated 180 degrees)
          position: (1,1) & (2,1), (2,2)
      - object_2:
           color: 8 (azure)
           shape: L-shape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise)
           position: (3,4), (3,5) & (4,5)
      - object_3:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (1, 2)
      - object_4:
        color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cell
        position: (4, 4)
```

**Natural Language Description:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can identify two distinct L-shaped objects, both colored azure (8).

2.  **Object Persistence:** Both azure L-shaped objects from input grid are present in the output grid, in exactly in the same absolute positions.

3. **New object detection**: Two new single-cell blue pixels were added, one between the two cells of the vertical part of the first azure L-shape, and other between the horizontal part of the second azure L-shape

4.  **Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is to keep the position and shape of L-shapes azure objects, and to add one blue cell to fill their inner empty corner.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
