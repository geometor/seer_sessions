Okay, let's analyze the third example transformation.

**Observations:**

*   **Input Grid:**
    *   Contains one red (2) pixel, near the top.
    *   Contains one blue (1) pixel, near the bottom.
    *   Contains one magenta (6) pixel.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.
*   **Output Grid:**
    *   The red (2), blue (1) and magenta(6) pixels remain in the same positions.
    *   Yellow (4) pixels appear to the left and right of the red pixel, one row above, and one row below.
    *   Orange (7) pixels appear to the left, right, and above the blue pixel.
    *   The rest of the grid is filled with white (0) pixels.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all red (2), blue (1) and magenta (6) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Positions:** Keep the red (2), blue (1) and magenta (6) pixels in their original positions in the output grid.
3.  **Add Yellow Pixels:** For *each* red (2) pixel:
    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel one row *above* and one column to the *left*.
    *   Place another yellow (4) pixel one row *above* and one column to the *right*.
    *   Place a yellow (4) pixel one row *below* and one column to the *left*.
    *   Place another yellow (4) pixel one row *below* and one column to the *right*.
4.  **Add Orange Pixels:** For *each* blue (1) pixel:
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one column to the *left*.
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one column to the *right*.
    *   Place an orange (7) pixel one row *above*.
5.  **Fill Remaining:** All other cells in the output grid remain white (0).

**Summary of actions**

The transformation preserves the positions of the existing red, blue and magenta pixels and introduces new yellow pixels around each of the red pixels and orange pixels around each of the blue pixels based on their relative positions. It generalizes the rule from the previous examples. The magenta pixel does not generate any additional pixels, and all other pixels remain white.

The provided python program from previous response is able to solve this.
