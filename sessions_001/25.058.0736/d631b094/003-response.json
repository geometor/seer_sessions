            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, which involved counting blue pixels and creating a 1xN blue grid. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally. Some examples involve different colors and output grid shapes. Therefore, the strategy needs to shift from a fixed color and shape rule to a more adaptive one, likely based on identifying a pattern or relationship between the input and output grids that is consistent across *all* examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo get a clearer picture, let's use code to analyze each example pair. I'll focus on:\n\n*   Input and Output grid shapes\n*   Pixel counts for each color in both input and output\n*   Any immediately obvious relationships (e.g., mirroring, rotation) that are consistent.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):\n    input_shape = input_grid.shape\n    output_shape = output_grid.shape\n\n    input_color_counts = Counter(input_grid.flatten())\n    output_color_counts = Counter(output_grid.flatten())\n    \n    print(f\"Input shape: {input_shape}, Output shape: {output_shape}\")\n    print(f\"Input color counts: {input_color_counts}\")\n    print(f\"Output color counts: {output_color_counts}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    \nexamples = task_data[\"train\"]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n  print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n  analyze_example(np.array(example[\"input\"]), np.array(example[\"output\"]))\n```"
