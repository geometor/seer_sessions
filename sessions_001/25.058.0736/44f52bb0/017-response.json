            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and task examples to refine our natural language program and address the discrepancies.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code focuses solely on counting the occurrences of the value '2' (red) and producing a 1x1 blue grid if the count is exactly 2. This approach is too narrow and doesn't capture the broader pattern present in the training examples. The results indicate that this rule is not universally applicable, failing on examples 1 and 2, with only example 0 passing. We need a strategy that considers other colors and potentially spatial relationships, not just the count of red pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n1.  **Expand Observation:** Stop focusing exclusively on '2' and consider all colors present in the input and output grids.\n2.  **Spatial Relationships:** The solution likely involves a specific spatial pattern or relationship rather than just counting. Investigate how objects are positioned relative to each other.\n3.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation may not always produce a blue pixel; other output colors should be examined.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution - conceptually):**\n\nTo provide accurate reports, I would ideally use `code_execution` to inspect each input and output. Since that's not directly available here, I'll describe the process and expected results conceptually.\n\n*   **Example 0:**\n    *   Input: Contains two red pixels (2) and multiple black pixels (0).\n    *   Output: Single blue pixel (1).\n    *   Initial code result: Correct.\n    *   Observation: The two reds were not adjacent.\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input:  Contains one yellow(4), one blue(1)\n    *   Output: A single black pixel (0).\n    *   Initial Code Result: Incorrect.\n    *   Observation:  The count of `2` is zero. output is `0`\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Contains a single green (3), one orange(7)\n    *   Output: A single black pixel (0).\n    *   Initial Code Result: Incorrect.\n    *   Observation:  The count of `2` is zero, output is `0`\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nexample_0:\n  input:\n    objects:\n      - color: red\n        count: 2\n      - color: black\n        count: >2 #more than 2\n    spatial_relationship: \"non-adjacent red pixels\"\n  output:\n    objects:\n      - color: blue\n        count: 1\n\nexample_1:\n    input:\n        objects:\n            - color: yellow\n              count: 1\n            - color: blue\n              count: 1\n    output:\n        objects:\n            - color: black\n              count: 1\nexample_2:\n    input:\n        objects:\n            - color: green\n              count: 1\n            - color: orange\n              count: 1\n    output:\n        objects:\n            - color: black\n              count: 1\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify all the single-pixel colored objects, excluding black, in the input grid.**\n2.  **Count the number of such objects**\n3.  **If there are exactly two single pixel objects of any colors, the output is a 1x1 grid with a blue (1) pixel.**\n4. **If there is not exactly two single pixel objects of any colors, the output is a 1x1 grid with a black (0) pixel.**\n"
