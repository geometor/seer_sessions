observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: (7, 11)
      objects:
        - color: 2 #red
          size: 6
      output: 3
      notes: "Two red objects, of size 3 each. Output is size of the red object."
  - example_2:
      input_shape: (11, 11)
      objects:
        - color: 1 #blue
          size: 12
      output: 6
      notes: "One blue object, split vertically yields size of 6. Output equals vertical size of object"
  - example_3:
      input_shape: (3, 17)
      objects:
        - color: 2 #red
          size: 8
      output: 4
      notes: "One red object, split vertically yields size of 4.  Output equals vertical size of object"
