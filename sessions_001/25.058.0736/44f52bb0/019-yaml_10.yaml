observations:
  - input_grid: "Represents a 2D array of pixel values (colors)."
  - output_grid: "A 1x1 grid representing a boolean value (0 or 1)."
  - pixel_values: "Integers from 0 to 9, representing colors."
  - black_pixel: "Value 0 represents a black pixel."
  - non_black_pixels: "Pixels with values other than 0."
  - condition: "The output is determined by the count of non-black pixels in the input."

actions:
  - count_pixels: "Count the number of pixels that are not black (value not equal to 0)."
  - determine_output: "Set output to 1 if the count of non-black pixels is exactly 2, otherwise set to 0."
