## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D557B10>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7A627D5576B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of digits, where each digit likely represents a color. The output is a single digit, also potentially representing a color, contained within what looks like a 1x1 grid. The core task seems to involve analyzing the colors in the input grid and producing a single color as output. The colors in use seem to be red (2) and white (0).

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 2
        color: red
        positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), (1,1)]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements:
      - value: 1
        color: blue
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count the Colors:** Count the number of occurrences of each color in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Dominant Color:** In the input grid provided, count the number occurrences of color `red`.
3. **Output Single Pixel Grid** Create a 1x1 output grid with the value as blue(`1`).

Essentially, the rule is a transformation of a grid into a 1x1 pixel with a blue color if the input grid exists.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
