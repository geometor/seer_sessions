Previous Code:
```python
"""
Counts the occurrences of the value '2' (red) in the input grid. If the count is 2, the output is a 1x1 grid with the value '1' (blue).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid.  Start with a default value, we'll change if conditions are met.
    output_grid = np.array([[0]])

    # Count the occurrences of '2' in the input grid.
    count_of_2 = np.count_nonzero(input_grid == 2)

    # If the count is 2, set the output to 1.
    if count_of_2 == 2:
        output_grid = np.array([[1]])

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code, results, and task examples to refine our natural language program and address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focuses solely on counting the occurrences of the value '2' (red) and producing a 1x1 blue grid if the count is exactly 2. This approach is too narrow and doesn't capture the broader pattern present in the training examples. The results indicate that this rule is not universally applicable, failing on examples 1 and 2, with only example 0 passing. We need a strategy that considers other colors and potentially spatial relationships, not just the count of red pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**
1.  **Expand Observation:** Stop focusing exclusively on '2' and consider all colors present in the input and output grids.
2.  **Spatial Relationships:** The solution likely involves a specific spatial pattern or relationship rather than just counting. Investigate how objects are positioned relative to each other.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation may not always produce a blue pixel; other output colors should be examined.

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution - conceptually):**

To provide accurate reports, I would ideally use `code_execution` to inspect each input and output. Since that's not directly available here, I'll describe the process and expected results conceptually.

*   **Example 0:**
    *   Input: Contains two red pixels (2) and multiple black pixels (0).
    *   Output: Single blue pixel (1).
    *   Initial code result: Correct.
    *   Observation: The two reds were not adjacent.
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input:  Contains one yellow(4), one blue(1)
    *   Output: A single black pixel (0).
    *   Initial Code Result: Incorrect.
    *   Observation:  The count of `2` is zero. output is `0`
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Contains a single green (3), one orange(7)
    *   Output: A single black pixel (0).
    *   Initial Code Result: Incorrect.
    *   Observation:  The count of `2` is zero, output is `0`

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
example_0:
  input:
    objects:
      - color: red
        count: 2
      - color: black
        count: >2 #more than 2
    spatial_relationship: "non-adjacent red pixels"
  output:
    objects:
      - color: blue
        count: 1

example_1:
    input:
        objects:
            - color: yellow
              count: 1
            - color: blue
              count: 1
    output:
        objects:
            - color: black
              count: 1
example_2:
    input:
        objects:
            - color: green
              count: 1
            - color: orange
              count: 1
    output:
        objects:
            - color: black
              count: 1
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify all the single-pixel colored objects, excluding black, in the input grid.**
2.  **Count the number of such objects**
3.  **If there are exactly two single pixel objects of any colors, the output is a 1x1 grid with a blue (1) pixel.**
4. **If there is not exactly two single pixel objects of any colors, the output is a 1x1 grid with a black (0) pixel.**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
