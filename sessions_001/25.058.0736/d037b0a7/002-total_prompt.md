## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D4E27B0>

**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D4E25D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color (as defined in the color map). The transformation seems to involve propagating or extending the color in the top-right corner (value 6, magenta) to other cells in the grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer values (0-9)

actions:
  - type: propagation
    source: top-right pixel (color 6)
    targets:
      - bottom-right pixel
      - center-right pixel
      - bottom-center pixel

relationships:
   - spatial: grid structure with rows and columns
   - color-based: transformation based on color of specific pixel
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the color of the pixel in the top-right corner of the input grid (index [0,2]).
2.  **Propagate** this color to the following pixels:
    *   The pixel in the bottom-right corner (index [2,2]).
    *   The pixel in the center-right (index [1,2]).
    *   The pixel in the bottom center (index [2,1]).
3. **Keep** all other pixels the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
