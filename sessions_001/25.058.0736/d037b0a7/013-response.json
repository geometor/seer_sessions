Both grids are 3x3.  The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The input grid has three distinct colors (represented by 0, 2, and 4), while the output has the same colors. The primary change seems to be a replication or extension of certain colored pixels downwards.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
