Previous Code:
```python
"""
Rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)
            
    return output_array.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and update the natural language program and observations accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code, which rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise, works correctly for the first training example but fails for the second. This indicates that a simple 90-degree rotation is not the general rule governing the transformation. We need to consider other possibilities, such as reflections, different rotation angles, or potentially more complex operations that involve identifying and manipulating specific objects within the grid. The second example appears to be a horizontal flip. Therefore a good approach would be to focus on refining the transformation rule to accurately capture the operation observed in the second training example, possibly trying reflections (horizontal or vertical) before exploring more complex rules.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To get precise information, I will execute the code, report the results, calculate differences, and analyze properties of the input and output grids.

    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    
    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)
            
    return output_array.tolist()

  expected_output = example['output']
  actual_output = transform(input_grid)
  match = np.array_equal(np.array(actual_output), np.array(expected_output))
  results.append({

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    shape: (5, 12)
    object_count: 1
    objects:
      - type: rectangle
        color: gray
        dimensions: (5, 12)
  output:
    shape: (12, 5)
    object_count: 1
    objects:
      - type: rectangle
        color: gray
        dimensions: (12, 5)
  transformation:
    type: rotation
    angle: 90_degrees_clockwise
    
example_2:
    input:
      shape: (5, 12)
      object_count: 1
      objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: grey
          dimensions: (5, 12)
    output:
      shape: (5, 12)
      object_count: 1
      objects:
        - type: rectangle
          color: grey
          dimensions: (5,12)
    transformation:
      type: horizontal_reflection
```

**Natural Language Program:**

Based on the two examples, the transformation rule is not consistently a 90-degree rotation. The first example suggests a 90 degree rotation and the second appears to perform a horizontal flip (reflection across the vertical axis). It's possible the transformation is conditional based on a property that we have not yet perceived. More data is required. Given the examples available so far, the following rule is suggested:

1.  **Check Input Dimensions:**
    *   If the input grid's height is less than its width, rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   Otherwise, reflect the grid horizontally (flip over the vertical axis).

This rule is a tentative hypothesis. More examples are needed to confirm its accuracy.

Revised Natural Language Program:

1. Reflect the input grid horizontally.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
