## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D8D25D0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D8D2CB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation between the input and output appears to be a rotation of the grid. The colors/numbers themselves don't change; their positions within the grid do. It seems like a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_codes
  - operation: rotation
    type: clockwise
    degrees: 90
  - relation: input_grid -> rotated -> output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input is a 3x3 grid of numbers.
2.  Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3.  The resulting rotated grid is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
