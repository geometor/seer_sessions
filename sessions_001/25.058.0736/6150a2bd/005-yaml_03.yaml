observations:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output grids are 2D arrays of integers representing colors.
  - type: transformation
    subtype: rotation
    description: The transformation is a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
  - type: object_permanence
    description: The values (colors) within the grid remain constant; only their positions change.
  - type: shape
    description: Input and output shapes are always square (though possibly different squares), or in some cases, rectangular. After rotation they are the same dimensions
