## Example 2

**input:**
```
5 5 2
1 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D8D2CB0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 1
2 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627DB27930>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simply recoloring pixels based on their initial color.  Instead, the spatial arrangement and relative positions of the colors seem crucial.  The input and output grids are 3x3. The colors in the input grid are re-arranged in the output grid. There appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation and a reflection.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids.
  - type: cell_values
    description: Cell values represent colors (0-9).
  - type: object
    description: Each contiguous block of the same color can be considered an object.
  - type: transformation
    description: The transformation involves a spatial rearrangement of the colors.
  - type: observation
    description: The transformation appears to combine a rotation and potentially reflection or other reordering.
  - type: rotation
    details: Suspected 90-degree clockwise rotation.
  - type: possible_reflection:
    details: Potential reflection along either a vertical or horizontal axis
  - type: color_preservation
    description: The colors in the input are present, although rearranged, in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
2.  **Reflect:** Reflect the rotated grid across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).

In other words the transformation is reflection across the vertical axis, y.
This moves (x,y) -> (width-1-x, y)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
