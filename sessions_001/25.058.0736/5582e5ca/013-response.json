The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (magenta, represented by the digit 6). The key seems to be identifying a specific color within the input grid that dictates the color of the entire output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

In case of a tie that includes the color at the top and middle element, it looks like the top/middle value wins.\n2.  **Flood Fill:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3). Fill every pixel of the output grid with the color identified. In this case, we used to color magenta, represented by the digit '6'.\n"
