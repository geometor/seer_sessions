## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 8 9
1 8 1
9 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627DB27930>

**output:**
```
9 9 9
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D8D2CB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a numerical value (0-9) corresponding to a specific color. The input grid contains a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with the color corresponding to the number 9 (maroon). The overall size and shape of the grid remain constant during the transformation.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    input_state: diverse colors
    output_state: uniform color (9/maroon)
    transformation: color replacement
    objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          - value: integer (0-9)
          - color: derived from value
    relationships:
      - pixels form a grid
      - input grid transforms to output grid
      - pixel values change during transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target color:** In the input grid, locate all pixels with the value 9 (maroon).
2.  **Replace all pixels:** Change the value of every pixel in the grid to 9 (maroon).
3. The output grid will use all nines in the same shape as the input

Essentially, the transformation rule is to replace all pixels in the input grid with the color maroon (value 9), regardless of their original color. The most frequent number could also be a source for the answer

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
