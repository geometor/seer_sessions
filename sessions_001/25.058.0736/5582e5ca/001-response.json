The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (yellow, represented by the digit '4').  The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical (3x3 in this case). The core transformation seems to involve identifying a specific color within the input and then flooding the entire output grid with that color. The selected color is likely present in the input.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
