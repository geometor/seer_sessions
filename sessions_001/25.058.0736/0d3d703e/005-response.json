            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on a simple increment-by-one rule with modulo 10 wrapping. This approach appears to be correct, as evidenced by the perfect match between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs for all training examples.  There are no errors to resolve.\n\nSince there are no errors, the core strategy is to simply reaffirm the existing natural language program and provide supporting evidence from the successful execution on all training examples. We will also document this in a structured YAML format. No changes need to be made.\n\n**Metrics and Code Execution**\n\nSince all examples produced the expected output we do not need additional code to verify the result.\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with values ranging from 0-8.\n    *   Expected Output: Same size grid with values incremented by 1.\n    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected Output.\n    *   Result: Success.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 5x5 grid with values ranging from 0-9, testing the modulo 10 wrap-around (9 becomes 0).\n    *   Expected Output: Same size grid, values incremented, with 9 wrapping to 0.\n    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected Output.\n    *   Result: Success.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 7x7 grid with a larger variety of numbers, more wrapping from 9 to 0.\n    *   Expected Output: Same size grid, values incremented, with 9 wrapping to 0.\n    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected Output.\n    *   Result: Success.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: |\n  The task involves incrementing each pixel's color value in a grid by one, with a modulo 10 operation to handle wraparound.\n\nobservations:\n  - object_type: grid\n    properties:\n      - dimensions: same for input and output\n      - cells: integer values from 0-9 representing colors\n    transformations:\n      - operation: increment each pixel value by 1\n      - modulo: result is taken modulo 10 (wraparound from 9 to 0)\n  - object_type: pixel\n    properties:\n        - color_value: an integer from 0-9\n    transformations:\n      - operation: increment value\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Grid Preservation:** The output grid maintains the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.\n2.  **Pixel Increment:** Each pixel in the input grid is incremented by 1 to generate the corresponding pixel in the output grid.\n3.  **Modulo 10 Wrap-around:**  If incrementing a pixel's value results in 10, the value wraps around to 0.  Mathematically, the output pixel value is equivalent to the (input pixel value + 1) modulo 10.\n"
