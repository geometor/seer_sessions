The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Grid Preservation:** The output grid maintains the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.
2.  **Pixel Increment:** Each pixel in the input grid is incremented by 1 to generate the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
3.  **Modulo 10 Wrap-around:**  If incrementing a pixel's value results in 10, the value wraps around to 0.  Mathematically, the output pixel value is equivalent to the (input pixel value + 1) modulo 10.
