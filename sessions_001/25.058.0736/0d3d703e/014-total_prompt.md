## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 8 6
5 8 6
5 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627D557610>

**output:**
```
1 9 2
1 9 2
1 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A627DB27930>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid has a distinct pattern of three colors (gray, azure, magenta) represented by the numbers 5, 8, and 6.  The output grid mirrors the layout but uses different colors (blue, maroon, red) represented by 1, 9, and 2. The transformation appears to be a simple color substitution, with each color in the input consistently mapping to a specific color in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - attribute: color
        values:
          input: [5, 8, 6]
          output: [1, 9, 2]

transformations:
  - type: color_substitution
    mapping:
      5: 1  # Gray to Blue
      8: 9  # Azure to Maroon
      6: 2  # Magenta to Red

relationships:
  - type: one-to-one
    description: Each color in the input grid maps to a unique color in the output grid.
  - type: spatial_consistency
    description: The spatial arrangement of pixels remains identical between input and output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves a direct color substitution on a 3x3 grid. The input grid's colors are replaced according to the following rule:

1.  Gray (5) is replaced with Blue (1).
2.  Azure (8) is replaced with Maroon (9).
3.  Magenta (6) is replaced with Red (2).

The spatial configuration of the grid, including the position of each pixel, remains unchanged during the transformation. The output grid is a direct color-mapped version of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
