task_description: |
  The task involves incrementing each pixel's color value in a grid by one, with a modulo 10 operation to handle wraparound.

observations:
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same for input and output
      - cells: integer values from 0-9 representing colors
    transformations:
      - operation: increment each pixel value by 1
      - modulo: result is taken modulo 10 (wraparound from 9 to 0)
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
        - color_value: an integer from 0-9
    transformations:
      - operation: increment value
