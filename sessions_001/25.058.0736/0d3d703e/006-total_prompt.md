Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Grid Preservation:** The output grid has the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.
2.  **Pixel Increment:** Each pixel in the input grid is incremented by 1 to produce the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
3.  **Modulo 10:** If incrementing a pixel's value results in 10, the value wraps around to 0.  In other words, the output pixel value is the result of (input pixel value + 1) modulo 10.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by incrementing each pixel's value by 1, wrapping around from 9 to 0.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): A 2D list representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        list of lists: A 2D list representing the output grid.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.array(input_grid)

    # Iterate over each pixel in the input grid and increment its value by 1, taking the modulo by 10.
    output_grid = (output_grid + 1) % 10 # using numpy element-wise addition and modulo

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on a simple increment-by-one rule with modulo 10 wrapping. This approach appears to be correct, as evidenced by the perfect match between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs for all training examples.  There are no errors to resolve.

Since there are no errors, the core strategy is to simply reaffirm the existing natural language program and provide supporting evidence from the successful execution on all training examples. We will also document this in a structured YAML format. No changes need to be made.

**Metrics and Code Execution**

Since all examples produced the expected output we do not need additional code to verify the result.

**Example Analysis:**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with values ranging from 0-8.
    *   Expected Output: Same size grid with values incremented by 1.
    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected Output.
    *   Result: Success.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid with values ranging from 0-9, testing the modulo 10 wrap-around (9 becomes 0).
    *   Expected Output: Same size grid, values incremented, with 9 wrapping to 0.
    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected Output.
    *   Result: Success.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7 grid with a larger variety of numbers, more wrapping from 9 to 0.
    *   Expected Output: Same size grid, values incremented, with 9 wrapping to 0.
    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected Output.
    *   Result: Success.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves incrementing each pixel's color value in a grid by one, with a modulo 10 operation to handle wraparound.

observations:
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: same for input and output
      - cells: integer values from 0-9 representing colors
    transformations:
      - operation: increment each pixel value by 1
      - modulo: result is taken modulo 10 (wraparound from 9 to 0)
  - object_type: pixel
    properties:
        - color_value: an integer from 0-9
    transformations:
      - operation: increment value
```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Grid Preservation:** The output grid maintains the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid.
2.  **Pixel Increment:** Each pixel in the input grid is incremented by 1 to generate the corresponding pixel in the output grid.
3.  **Modulo 10 Wrap-around:**  If incrementing a pixel's value results in 10, the value wraps around to 0.  Mathematically, the output pixel value is equivalent to the (input pixel value + 1) modulo 10.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
