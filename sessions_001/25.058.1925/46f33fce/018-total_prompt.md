Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the idea of expanding each colored region into a rectangle occupying 1/4th of the total grid area, centered around the initial position of the color. This approach works for the first example but fails to generalize to the other examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't about expanding to a fixed fraction of the grid, but rather about *replicating* and *positioning* existing shapes based on their color and possibly their initial arrangement. The code needs a shift in strategy.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Abandon fixed-area expansion:** The 1/4th area rule is incorrect. We need to identify the *actual* shapes formed by the colors in the input.
2.  **Focus on replication:** The outputs seem to involve replicating the input shapes, not just expanding them.
3.  **Identify positioning rules:** Determine how the replicated shapes are positioned relative to each other and the original shapes. Color seems to play a key role in the replication and positioning.
4.  **Shape, Not Just Color:** the initial code treats everything as a single pixel - we need to determine the shape of the original object, and the shape of the output.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To get better metrics, I'll provide the dimensions and colors, and will describe what the code produced vs what was in the expected output.

**Example 0**

*   **Input:** 3x3, Colors: Green (3) in the center.
*   **Expected Output:** 6x6, Four Green (3) squares in a 2x2 arrangement.
*   **Actual Output:** a 6x6 with the original square expanded around the central point
*   **Analysis**: code expanded and positioned the square correctly

**Example 1**

*   **Input:** 5x5, Colors: Red (2) at (1,1), Orange (7) at (3,3).
*   **Expected Output:** 10x10, Two Red (2) squares and two Orange (7) squares in a specific arrangement.
*   **Actual output:** A 10 x 10, the origin points are placed at roughly the same location, expanding equally in all directions.
*   **Analysis:** Incorrect. The expansion logic doesn't account for the specific replication and positioning of the two colored shapes.

**Example 2**

*   **Input:** 7x7, Colors: Blue(1) at (2,2), Yellow (4) at (4,4)
*   **Expected Output:** 14x14, The objects arranged in the expected 2 x 2 pattern.
*   **Actual output:** A 14 x 14, with the original points placed at roughly the same location expanding equally in all directions.
*   **Analysis:** Incorrect. Similar issues as with Example 1.

**Example 3**

*   **Input:** 9x9, Colors: Yellow(4) at center, and Blue (1) and Orange(7).
*   **Expected output:** 18x18, arranged in a 2 x 2 grid, each with colors from input
*   **Actual output**: An 18x18, with the correct color and location for Yellow, but incorrect locations for the other objects.
* **Analysis**: Incorrect, similar to the example above.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find each contiguous region of non-zero color in the input grid. Consider each of these regions as a single object, even if it's just a single pixel.
2.  **Double Dimensions:** Double the dimensions of the input grid (height and width) to create the output grid.
3.  **Replicate and Arrange:** For each identified object in the input:
    *   Create a copy of that object, scaling it up to the size of original input grid.
    * Create a 2x2 grid in output.
    * Place one copy of the object scaled to fit in each quadrant.

This program focuses on identifying objects, doubling the grid size, and replicating/arranging the identified colored objects.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
