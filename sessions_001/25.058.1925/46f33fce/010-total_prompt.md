Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9) into another grid. The input grid contains single, isolated, non-zero pixels, each of a different color. The output grid seems to expand these single pixels into rectangular blocks of the same color. The background (0, or white) seems to act as a separator, preventing the blocks from expanding to the full grid size. The sizes and shapes of expanded colored blocks are not uniform.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [blue, green, yellow, azure, red]
      value: [1, 3, 4, 8, 2]
      position: (row, col) # Initial position in the input grid
  - type: block
    properties:
      color: same as corresponding pixel
      top_left: (row, col)
      bottom_right: (row, col)

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Expands a single pixel into a rectangular block of the same color.
    constraints:
      - Expansion stops at the edge of the grid or when encountering a white (0) pixel.

relationships:
  - Each isolated non-zero pixel in the input corresponds to a rectangular block of the same color in the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Isolated Pixels:** Find all non-zero pixels in the input grid that are not adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any other non-zero pixel. Each of these identified pixels will act as the seed for the expansion.
2. **Expansion Process:** For each of the identified pixel, create a square that is size of how many colored objects there are. The first object found, is always a square, aligned to the top left.
3. **Order of finding**: Scan the input grid for non-zero pixel from the top to bottom and left to right. The order the object are found will be how the block size will be ordered and aligned (e.g. top left is 1st, next would be beside it to the right, 3rd row under the 1st, and so on.
4. **Background Separation:** The expansion process ensures that blocks of different colors do not merge. White color acts as a boundary that limits the expansion of the blocks.
5. **Output:** Output final grid with the correct block colors and sizes.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
