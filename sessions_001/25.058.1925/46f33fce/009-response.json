The input grid contains single, isolated, non-zero pixels, each of a different color. The output grid seems to expand these single pixels into rectangular blocks of the same color. The background (0, or white) seems to act as a separator, preventing the blocks from expanding to the full grid size. The sizes and shapes of expanded colored blocks are not uniform.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Each of these identified pixels will act as the seed for the expansion.\n2. **Expansion Process:** For each of the identified pixel, create a square that is size of how many colored objects there are. The first object found, is always a square, aligned to the top left.\n3. **Order of finding**: Scan the input grid for non-zero pixel from the top to bottom and left to right. The order the object are found will be how the block size will be ordered and aligned (e.g. top left is 1st, next would be beside it to the right, 3rd row under the 1st, and so on.\n4. **Background Separation:** The expansion process ensures that blocks of different colors do not merge. White color acts as a boundary that limits the expansion of the blocks.\n5. **Output:** Output final grid with the correct block colors and sizes.\n\n"
