Here's my breakdown of the input-output pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program description.\n\n**Perception:**\n\nThe input grid contains a few distinct colored pixels (green, red, blue, and yellow) scattered within a predominantly white (0) background. The output grid appears to create rectangular blocks of color, expanding from the locations of the initial colored pixels. The expansion seems to stop when different colored blocks meet, and the white background is largely preserved. The non-zero pixels seem to \"claim\" surrounding territory.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
