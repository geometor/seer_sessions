Transforms an input grid by expanding isolated non-zero pixels into rectangular blocks of the same color, 
using the white (0) pixels as boundaries. The blocks are squares sized relative to the number of non-zero pixels,

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, incorporating the new information from the additional training examples:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a reasonable, but incomplete, interpretation of the first training example. The core idea of expanding isolated non-zero pixels is valid. However, the assumptions about block size (being equal to the number of objects) and the fixed 2x2 expansion pattern based on object count, and output grid shape are incorrect. The subsequent examples reveal a more complex rule that accounts for relative position and size of original color.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-evaluate Assumptions:** Discard the assumption that the output grid is always twice the size of the input, and block size is always equal to the number of objects.
2.  **Focus on Relative Positioning:** Pay close attention to how the original positions of the non-zero pixels influence the positions of the expanded blocks. The top-left to bottom-right ordering seems correct, but the spacing and block sizing are different.
3.  **Analyze Block Dimensions:** Determine the rule governing the size of each expanded block. It's not simply based on the *number* of non-zero pixels. It is most likely related to dimensions of each color.
4.  **Consider Boundary Conditions:** Ensure the code correctly handles cases where the expanded blocks might extend beyond the original grid boundaries (or expected output).
5.    **Iterative Refinement:** Test the updated code against *all* training examples after each modification to the natural language program and code.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Isolated Pixels:** Find all pixels that have a non-zero color and are not adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any other non-zero pixel.
2.  **Preserve Isolated Pixels**: Isolated pixels are copied to the output grid with no changes.
3. **Final Output:** The output grid dimensions match the input.

The provided transform function does not correctly represent the rule, so previous results are not accurate. The key observation, confirmed in the additional examples, is that isolated pixels are identified and preserved without changes in size or position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
