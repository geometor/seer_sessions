Okay, I'm ready to analyze the example input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 10x10 grid.
*   The output is a 20x20 grid.
*   The input grid contains single pixels of different colors (red, yellow, blue, green) on a white (0) background.
*    The output grid seems to expand these single pixels into larger square regions.
*    The background remains white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: pixel
    type: single cell
    properties:
      color: [red, yellow, blue, green, white]
      position: [row, column]
  - name: background
    type: grid
    properties:
     color: white
  - name: region
    type: square block of pixels
    properties:
      color: [red, yellow, blue, green]
      size: variable, depends on original pixel
      position: derived from original pixel

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: system
    input: pixel
    output: region
    description: A single pixel is expanded into a square region of the same color.

relationships:
    - type: contains
      subject: background
      object: pixel
    - type: expands_to
      subject: pixel
      object: region
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  **For each** identified pixel:
    *   Determine its color.
    *   Determine its position (row, column).
    *   **Expand** that pixel into a 4x4 square region in the output grid. The color of the square region matches the color of the original pixel.  The origin (top-left corner) of this 4x4 square is calculated. If the original pixel is in (r, c), The square region is at the position of the grid 2r, 2c.
3.   The rest of the pixels in the input grid are 0 (white). Create a new 20 x 20 grid with 0 as the value for the cells.
4.   Fill all remaining cells of output that does not correspond to an expanding square with the background color (white/0).

Essentially, each colored pixel in the input grid is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same color in the output grid, and the input grid gets upscaled by a factor of 2 in rows and a factor of 2 in columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
