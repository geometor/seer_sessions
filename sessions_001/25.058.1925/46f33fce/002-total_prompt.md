<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3920x1970 at 0x78E5F21D3DD0>Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids with single-digit integer values representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve expanding single-colored pixels into larger, rectangular blocks of the same color. The size and shape of these blocks appear to be consistent across all examples, and the background is white (value 0). There doesn't seem to be any interaction between different colored objects, so it might be possible to handle each color independently.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0-9]  # Integer representing color
      position: (x, y) # Coordinates in the grid
      is_part_of_block: boolean # after transformation

  - type: block
    properties:
      color: [0-9] #same as original pixel
      top_left: (x,y) #coords
      bottom_right: (x,y)
      width: int
      height: int

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Expands a single pixel into a rectangular block.
    parameters:
       input_color: int
       output_block_width: int
       output_block_height: int

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains multiple pixels
  - output_grid: contains multiple blocks
  - each_block: corresponds to one pixel in the input grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2. **Check** if it's background color i.e 0. If it is, skip.
3. **If** the pixel has a color other than 0, perform an "expansion":
    - Create a rectangular block of the same color as the original pixel.
        -For input pixels on rows 0-3 and columns 0-3, the created output block is 4x4.
        -For input pixels on rows 0-3 and columns 4-7, and 8-11, the created output block is 4x4
        -For input pixels on rows 4-7, and 8-11 and columns 0-3, 4-7, and 8-11, the created output block is 4x4.
    -  The top-left corner of the block has the original pixel's location on the x or y, rounded down to multiple of 4, and duplicated the necessary amount of times to fill the dimensions of the block.
4. **Place** the expanded block in the output grid, replacing any existing values. It appears there is no overlap.
5. **Repeat** steps 2-4 until all pixels in the input grid have been processed.
6. The output is the resulting grid after expansion.

Essentially input pixels are expanded into 4x4 blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
