The color of the square region matches the color of the original pixel.  The origin (top-left corner) of this 4x4 square is calculated. If the original pixel is in (r, c), The square region is at the position of the grid 2r, 2c.\n3.   The rest of the pixels in the input grid are 0 (white). Create a new 20 x 20 grid with 0 as the value for the cells.\n4.   Fill all remaining cells of output that does not correspond to an expanding square with the background color (white/0).\n\nEssentially, each colored pixel in the input grid is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same color in the output grid, and the input grid gets upscaled by a factor of 2 in rows and a factor of 2 in columns.\n"
