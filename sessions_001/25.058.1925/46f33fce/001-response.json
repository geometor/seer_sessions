The transformation seems to involve expanding single-colored pixels into larger, rectangular blocks of the same color. The size and shape of these blocks appear to be consistent across all examples, and the background is white (value 0). There doesn't seem to be any interaction between different colored objects, so it might be possible to handle each color independently.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
