facts:
  - description: "Each colored pixel in the input grid is treated as an individual object."
    details: "Objects are identified by their color and position (though position is irrelevant for replication)."
  - description: "The output grid's dimensions are double the input grid's dimensions (both width and height)."
  - description: "Each object (colored pixel) is replicated four times in the output grid."
  - description: "The replicated objects form a 2x2 arrangement within a subgrid the original size of the input grid."
  - description: "The top-left corner of each sub-grid within the output is determined by color."
  - description: "If there are multiple colors, each occupies a unique quadrant of the output."
  - description: example 4 shows that input grid coordinates are not always top-left of the output object, relative positions of the input colors determine relative positions of their output quadrants
