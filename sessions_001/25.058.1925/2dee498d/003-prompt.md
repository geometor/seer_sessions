Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule consistently reduces the width of the input grid. Specifically, the output grid has a width that is one-third the width of the input grid, keeping three consecutive input columns and collapsing them to first one. The height of the grid remains unchanged. The program takes every three consecutive columns from the input grid, looks at first column of each group of three, then creates a new grid consisting of only those first columns.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output grid dimensions.
    input_height = len(input_grid)
    input_width = len(input_grid[0])
    output_width = input_width // 3
    output_height = input_height
    output_grid = []

    # Iterate through rows to maintain height
    for row_index in range(output_height):
      new_row = []
      #take every third column starting at 0
      for col_index in range(0,input_width,3):
        new_row.append(input_grid[row_index][col_index])
      output_grid.append(new_row)


    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
