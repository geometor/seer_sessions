            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identifies the core concept of transforming an azure \"cross\" into an \"X\". However, it makes a significant error in assuming the size of the 'X' should always match the dimensions of the input grid. The training examples reveal that the 'X' maintains a consistent size regardless of the input grid dimensions. Also, the current logic doesn't perfectly handle cases where the input has multiple azure regions, or when the azure region is not in a 'cross' shape (as seen in example 3). We will need to also consider that some of the examples do not have azure pixels.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Decouple 'X' Size:** Modify the program to create an 'X' of a fixed size, independent of the input grid size.\n2.  **Handle Non-Cross Shapes:** Improve the logic to identify and process azure objects, creating an X whose center is the center of the source azure region.\n3.  **Handle edge cases:** improve logic to be robust in cases where there is no azure.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution results, implicit in this analysis but shown for clarity in the thought process):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 5x5, Azure cross at center.\n    *   Expected Output: 5x5, Azure 'X' at center.\n    *   Actual Output: 5x5, Azure 'X' filling the entire grid (incorrect size).\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 7x7, Azure cross at center.\n    *   Expected Output: 7x7, Azure 'X' at center (same size as in Example 1).\n    *   Actual Output: 7x7, Azure 'X' filling the entire grid (incorrect size).\n*    **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 3x3, Azure horizontal line at center.\n    *   Expected Output: 3x3, Azure 'X' at center (same size as previous exmaples).\n    *   Actual Output: 3x3, Azure 'X' filling the entire grid (incorrect size).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: 5x5\n      input_objects:\n        - color: azure\n          shape: cross\n          position: center\n      output_shape: 5x5\n      output_objects:\n        - color: azure\n          shape: X\n          position: center\n          size: standard  #consistent in all the examples\n      transformation: shape_change, size_standardization, other_colors_to_white\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: 7x7\n      input_objects:\n        - color: azure\n          shape: cross\n          position: center\n      output_shape: 7x7\n      output_objects:\n        - color: azure\n          shape: X\n          position: center\n          size: standard\n      transformation: shape_change, size_standardization, other_colors_to_white\n  - example_3:\n      input_shape: 3x3\n      input_objects:\n        - color: azure\n          shape: horizontal_line # different starting shape\n          position: center\n      output_shape: 3x3\n      output_objects:\n        - color: azure\n          shape: X\n          position: center\n          size: standard\n      transformation: shape_change, size_standardization, other_colors_to_white\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Region:** Locate any contiguous region of azure (8) pixels within the input grid. If no azure region is present, return a grid of all white.\n2.  **Find Center:** Determine the center coordinates of this azure region, averaging row and column indices.\n3.  **Create Standard 'X':** Create an azure 'X' shape. The arms of the X will extend from the center point. The X has fixed standard size, and the extent of the arms, up, down, left and right should each be 1.\n4.  **Populate Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled initially with white (0).\n5.  **Place 'X':** Place the standard-sized azure 'X' at the calculated center position in the output grid. If the placement of standard sized X exceeds the output grid boundary, clip at the boundary.\n6.  **Preserve Dimensions:** Ensure the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\n"
