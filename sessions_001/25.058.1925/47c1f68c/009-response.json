Both grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), green (3), and azure (8). The output grid seems to be a modified, perhaps rotated or reflected, version of a subset of elements of the input grid. It mainly contains azure(8) and white (0). The positions of non-zero colors look strategically, or geometrically, transformed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This cross is defined by a horizontal line and a vertical line intersecting at the center.\n\n2. **Remove non-cross:** Remove all colors that are not a part of the cross.\n\n3.  **Transpose/Flip:** Create an X shape. Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input, mirroring the cross shape from azure to white, except every other pixel on each of the four lines are azure colored.\n\n4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with white (0).\n"
