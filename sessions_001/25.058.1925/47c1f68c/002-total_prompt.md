**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The most prominent feature is a cross-like structure formed by a single color in each input grid. This cross is consistently present but changes in color and position across the examples. The transformation seems to involve rotating or mirroring this cross and potentially reducing its size or "thickness". The background, represented by '0' (white), is also a crucial element, as the cross's transformation modifies it. There are also isolated colored regions separate from the main cross.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: cross
    properties:
      - color: variable (red, azure, yellow)
      - shape: cross-like, formed by a horizontal and vertical line intersecting
      - size: variable
      - position: variable, centered
    actions:
      - rotated: 90 degrees clockwise
      - potentially_resized: reduced thickness
  - object: background
    properties:
       color: white (0)
    actions:
       modified: by the rotated cross
  - object: isolated_regions
    properties:
       color: various
       position: top-left, seemingly not interacting with cross
    actions:
       removed: during transformation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Cross:** Locate the cross-shaped object within the input grid. This is defined as a continuous horizontal and vertical line of the same non-zero color intersecting at a single point.
2. **Remove Other Objects** Remove any single or multi-colored objects that do not form part of the cross structure.
3.  **Rotate:** Rotate the cross 90 degrees clockwise.
4. **Maintain Cross, Reduce thickness.** The output is a cross structure, however, the thickness should be at most one cell. In other words, the output should be a rotated cross with no 2x2 same colored cells, besides white(0).
5.  **Output:** Generate the output grid with the rotated and potentially resized cross.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
