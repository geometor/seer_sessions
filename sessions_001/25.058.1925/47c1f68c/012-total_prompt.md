Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the assumption that the transformation involves extracting a cross shape of azure pixels and rearranging it into an 'X' shape. While this worked for the first example, it failed on subsequent examples. The primary issue is that the code doesn't correctly identify the structure to extract and how to position it in the output. It's also incorrectly handling grid sizes and positioning. The code assumes an 'X' made out of 'azure', however this isn't always correct.

The strategy for resolving the errors is to:
1.  **Re-examine the core transformation logic:** The current logic of finding a cross and transforming it into an X is too specific and not generalizable.
2.  **Focus on relative positioning:** Instead of absolute coordinates, consider how objects or patterns are positioned relative to each other or the grid boundaries.
3.  **Object Identification:** Better identify the consistent objects between the input and output.
4. **Output Shape:** determine how the output shape dimensions are determined.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

To get a better understanding of each example, I will use a consistent approach:

1.  **Input/Output Dimensions:** Note the dimensions of both grids.
2.  **Pixel Counts:** Count the occurrences of each color in both grids.
3.  **Object Description:** Identify significant objects, their positions, and relationships, making sure the 'objects' appear in both input and output.
4. **Result Grid:** compare to the generated output from previous code.

Here's a breakdown of each example:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 7x7
*   **Output Dimensions:** 7x7
*   **Input Pixel Counts:**
    *   Azure (8): 5
    *   Green (3): 44
*   **Output Pixel Counts:**
    *   Azure (8): 5
    *  White (0): 44
*   **Object Description:** Input has a cross shape of azure. Output has an 'X' of azure.
* **Result Grid:** correctly transformed azure pixels to X shape, all other pixels white.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 9x9
*   **Output Dimensions:** 9x9
*   **Input Pixel Counts:**
    *   Azure (8): 5
    *   Green (3): 76
*   **Output Pixel Counts:**
    *   Azure (8): 9
    * White (0): 72
*   **Object Description:** Input has a cross shape of azure. Output has an 'X' of azure. Note that output contains more azure pixels than input.
* **Result Grid:** Incorrect. While it forms an "X" shape and removes the green, it doesn't expand the azure 'X' shape to use 9 pixels as in the actual output.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input Dimensions:** 11x11
*   **Output Dimensions:** 11x11
*   **Input Pixel Counts:**
    *   Azure (8): 5
    *   Green (3): 116
*   **Output Pixel Counts:**
    *    Azure (8): 13
    *   White (0): 108
*   **Object Description:** Input has a cross shape of azure. Output has a larger 'X' shape. Note that the number of azure pixels has increased.
* **Result Grid:** Incorrect. It creates a small 'X', not matching the expected output's azure pixel distribution, which should extend closer to the borders.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Cross:** Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels forming a cross shape in the input grid.
2.  **Transform to 'X':** Change the shape of the azure object from a cross to an 'X'.
3.  **Resize 'X':** The size of the 'X' is determined by the size of the grid. In an *n* x *n* grid, there will be 2\**n* - 5 azure pixels on the 'X'.
4. **Replace Other Colors**: All non-azure pixels, in this case green(3), are changed to white(0).
5. **Maintain Grid Size**: The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
