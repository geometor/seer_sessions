Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are red (2), yellow (4), and white (0). The input grid appears to have a cross-like shape made of yellow pixels, with some red pixels in the top-left corner. The output grid retains only the yellow pixels from the input, and it seems like the shape has been rotated or reflected.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - width: 7 (input), 6 (output)
      - height: 7 (input), 6 (output)
      - colors: [0, 2, 4] (input), [0, 4] (output)

  - name: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

  - name: yellow_cross
      type: object
      properties:
        - color: 4
        - shape: cross-like

actions:
  - name: filter_color
    description: Remove pixels of a specific color.
  - name: rotate_or_reflect
    description: I am not certain if the shape will be rotated or reflected. It almost looks like it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise

relationships:
  - yellow_cross: is_composed_of: pixels (color=4)
  - grid: contains: pixels
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the cross shape composed of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Filter**: Remove all pixels that are not yellow (4).
3. **Rotate**: Rotate the pixels that make up the object by 90 degrees.
