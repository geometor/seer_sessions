It forms a plus shape. There is a small cluster of blue \"1\" in the upper left corner.\n*    The output appears have transformed the existing red objects and their locations, but blue is completely removed.\n*   The output grid seems to maintain some, but not all, of the red ('2') pixels from the input, arranged around a blank space.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
