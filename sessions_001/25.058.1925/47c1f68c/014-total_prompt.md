Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves identifying an azure (8) cross in the input grid, transforming it into an 'X' shape, resizing the 'X' based on the grid size, and replacing all other colors (green (3)) with white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_cross_center(grid):
    # Find the center of the cross shape
    rows, cols = np.where(grid == 8)
    if len(rows) == 0:
        return None
    center_row = int(np.mean(rows))
    center_col = int(np.mean(cols))
    return center_row, center_col

def transform(input_grid):

    # Convert input_grid to numpy array for easier manipulation
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)

    # Find the center of the cross (although we don't use it directly, it's good to check for existence)

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # The condition for 'X' is that it lies on either diagonal.
            if i == j or i + j == rows - 1:
                output_grid[i, j] = 8

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the core concept of transforming an azure "cross" into an "X". However, it makes a significant error in assuming the size of the 'X' should always match the dimensions of the input grid. The training examples reveal that the 'X' maintains a consistent size regardless of the input grid dimensions. Also, the current logic doesn't perfectly handle cases where the input has multiple azure regions, or when the azure region is not in a 'cross' shape (as seen in example 3). We will need to also consider that some of the examples do not have azure pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Decouple 'X' Size:** Modify the program to create an 'X' of a fixed size, independent of the input grid size.
2.  **Handle Non-Cross Shapes:** Improve the logic to identify and process azure objects, creating an X whose center is the center of the source azure region.
3.  **Handle edge cases:** improve logic to be robust in cases where there is no azure.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution results, implicit in this analysis but shown for clarity in the thought process):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 5x5, Azure cross at center.
    *   Expected Output: 5x5, Azure 'X' at center.
    *   Actual Output: 5x5, Azure 'X' filling the entire grid (incorrect size).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 7x7, Azure cross at center.
    *   Expected Output: 7x7, Azure 'X' at center (same size as in Example 1).
    *   Actual Output: 7x7, Azure 'X' filling the entire grid (incorrect size).
*    **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 3x3, Azure horizontal line at center.
    *   Expected Output: 3x3, Azure 'X' at center (same size as previous exmaples).
    *   Actual Output: 3x3, Azure 'X' filling the entire grid (incorrect size).

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: 5x5
      input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: cross
          position: center
      output_shape: 5x5
      output_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: X
          position: center
          size: standard  #consistent in all the examples
      transformation: shape_change, size_standardization, other_colors_to_white

      input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: cross

          position: center
          size: standard
      transformation: shape_change, size_standardization, other_colors_to_white
  - example_3:
      input_shape: 3x3
      input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: horizontal_line # different starting shape
          position: center
      output_shape: 3x3
      output_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: X
          position: center
          size: standard
      transformation: shape_change, size_standardization, other_colors_to_white
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Region:** Locate any contiguous region of azure (8) pixels within the input grid. If no azure region is present, return a grid of all white.
2.  **Find Center:** Determine the center coordinates of this azure region, averaging row and column indices.
3.  **Create Standard 'X':** Create an azure 'X' shape. The arms of the X will extend from the center point. The X has fixed standard size, and the extent of the arms, up, down, left and right should each be 1.
4.  **Populate Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled initially with white (0).
5.  **Place 'X':** Place the standard-sized azure 'X' at the calculated center position in the output grid. If the placement of standard sized X exceeds the output grid boundary, clip at the boundary.
6.  **Preserve Dimensions:** Ensure the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
