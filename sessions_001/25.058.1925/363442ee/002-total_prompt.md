<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2576x1202 at 0x78E5F99B6BD0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary elements are grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There's a consistent vertical gray (5) column separating two regions within each grid. The input grids contain blue (1) pixels, seemingly at random locations, to the right of the dividing gray column. These pixels disappear in the output. The left side region relative to the separator is copied and either placed to the right of the separator column, or to both right and below it. The regions with copied colors seems to maintain shape, which is either L-shaped or a reverse L.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are of the same height but varying widths, containing digits 0-9, representing different colors.
  - object: |
      A vertical column of '5' (gray) acts as a separator, consistently present in all grids.
  - object_property: |
      The region to the left of the separator contains a multi-colored shape.
  - object_property: |
      The region to the right of the separator contains some blue(1) colored cells in input and white(0) empty cells.
  - action: |
      The shape in the region to the left of the separator is replicated on the region to the right of the separator.
  - action: |
      Blue pixels to the right of the separator are removed (changed to 0)
  - relationship: |
      Output grid dimensions may be related to the presence and location of the input elements left to the separator.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Separator:** Locate the vertical column of gray (5) pixels. This divides the grid into a left and right region.
2.  **Clear Blue Pixels**: scan the grid and locate any blue (1) pixels, set the value of those locations as 0 (white).
3.  **Copy Left Region:** Copy the shape present to the left of the separator column.
4.  **Paste to the Right Region:** Paste the copied shape to the right region, with separator as the left border.
5.  **Check for Second Shape:** If the original shape is not square and touches the lower border, copy the shape, rotate clockwise by 90 degrees, then paste it so it is located where the top border of the shape is the last row of the grid, and the left border is the separator.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
