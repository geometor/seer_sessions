The primary colors present are: yellow (4), red (2), magenta (6), gray (5), and blue (1). There's a distinct vertical gray bar in the input. The transformation seems to involve replicating a colored shape and repositioning other colored pixels. The output keeps the gray bar.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
