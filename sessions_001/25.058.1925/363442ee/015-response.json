The primary visual elements are:\n\n*   **Colored Regions:** Groups of adjacent pixels of the same color.\n*   **Shapes:** The colored regions form distinct shapes. There is one particular grey vertical line.\n*    A significant portion of both grids is filled with 0 (white), acting as background.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

This line is at a constant x-coordinate (x=4 in this example).\n\n2.  **Define Left Region:** Consider all pixels to the left of the gray line as the \"source\" or \"left\" region.\n\n3.  **Copy and Shift:** Copy the pattern of the left region, and place it directly to the right of the grey line.\n\n4.   **Repeat, wrap and fill.**\n    -    If there is a blue pixel in the region to the right, copy only until one\n         column before.\n    -    If there are no more blue pixels, or the end of the line, continue the\n         pattern.\n    -    Wrap if needed and continue until reaching the edge of the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replicates the left region's pattern to the right of the gray line, repeating and wrapping horizontally, until the end, accounting for any other objects (blue).\n"
