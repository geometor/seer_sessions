facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids consist of a 3x3 colored cluster in the top-left corner and a background, typically grey. The cluster always contains orange, red, and green pixels, and nothing that is transparent.
  - object: cluster
    properties:
      size: 3x3
      location: top-left corner
      colors: [orange, red, green]
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: [grey, transparent]
  - action: replication
    description: |
      The 3x3 cluster is replicated across the entire output grid, overwriting background.
      Only colored pixels are replicated - transparent (0) values are skipped.
  - constraint:
      Output grid dimensions are always identical to Input grid dimensions.
