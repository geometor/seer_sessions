Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is expanded to double its original height and width. Each row and column in the input is replicated into two of the same in the output. The replicated grid creates a checkerboard effect, surrounded by inverse.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height = input_height * 2
    output_width = input_width * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # replicate and insert rows and columns
    for i in range(input_height):
        for j in range(input_width):
            output_grid[2*i, 2*j] = input_grid[i, j]
            output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j] = input_grid[i, j]
            output_grid[2*i, 2*j+1] = input_grid[i, j]
            output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j+1] = input_grid[i, j]
    
    # create inverse checkerboard
    for i in range(output_height):

        if (i + j) % 2 == 1:
          if output_grid[i,j] == 3:
             output_grid[i,j] = 0
          elif output_grid[i,j] == 0:
             output_grid[i,j] = 3

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to double the input grid's dimensions and replicate each pixel into a 2x2 block, creating a checkerboard and then inverting based on input value. This works for the green and white pixels on the first example, but fails to capture the full transformation rule, as evidenced by the errors in subsequent examples. The core issue is that the inversion should replace 0 with 3 and 3 with 0 for the expanded grid, but leave any value that isn't 0 or 3, unchanged. The provided code does not handle other colors/values, but based on other examples, any value other than 0 or 3 is not modified by the transform, even if the pixel in question would fall onto a coordinate where the sum of row and col is odd.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Inversion Logic:** The current inversion logic is too broad, only 0 and 3 should be changed. We need to modify the code to specifically swap only these two values, without modifying other values present.
2.  **Verify and Iterate:** After adjusting the code, we'll re-run the tests and check for improvements. We will iteratively refine the logic until all training examples are correctly transformed.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**
Here's a breakdown of the examples:

**Example 1**
- input:
  ```
  [[3, 0, 3],
   [0, 3, 0],

   [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3],
   [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0],
   [0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3]]

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2, 3, 8] # all colors present across examples
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - height: 2 * input_grid.height
      - width: 2 * input_grid.width
      - initial_value: 0

actions:
  - name: replicate_pixels
    description: Each pixel in the input grid is replicated into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid, partially filled
  - name: invert_pixels
    description: >-
      Iterate over each cell of expanded output grid.
      Swap values of 0 and 3. All other values remain the same.
    input: output_grid
    output: output_grid, fully filled

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expansion:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to create an output grid.
2.  **Replication:** For each pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. Specifically, `output_grid[2*i, 2*j]`, `output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j]`, `output_grid[2*i, 2*j+1]`, and `output_grid[2*i+1, 2*j+1]` all receive the value of `input_grid[i, j]`.
3. **Selective Inversion**: Iterate through each cell in the *output* grid.
   * If a cell's value is 3, change it to 0.
   * If a cell's value is 0, change it to 3.
   * Otherwise, leave cell value unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
