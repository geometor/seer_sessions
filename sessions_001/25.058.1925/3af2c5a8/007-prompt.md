Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Expansion: The input grid is expanded to create an output grid that is double the height and double the width of the input grid.
2. Pixel Replication: Each individual pixel in the input grid is transformed into a 2x2 block of pixels of the same color in the output grid. For example, an azure pixel at position (0, 0) in the input becomes a 2x2 block of azure pixels at positions (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1) in the output. This replication applies to all pixels, regardless of their color.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the 2x2 replication rule."""
    input_rows, input_cols = input_grid.shape
    output_rows = input_rows * 2
    output_cols = input_cols * 2
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)

    # Iterate through each pixel of the input grid
    for i in range(input_rows):
        for j in range(input_cols):
            # Get the color of the current pixel
            color = input_grid[i, j]
            # Replicate the pixel into a 2x2 block in the output grid
            output_grid[2*i:2*i+2, 2*j:2*j+2] = color

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
