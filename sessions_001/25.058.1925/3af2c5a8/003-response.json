The primary color observed is '8' (azure) against a background of '0' (white). The input grid appears to be smaller than the output grid. The transformation seems to involve some form of expansion or duplication of the input grid, specifically replicating the azure pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The columns are added, so that the first and third are present twice, and then the pattern is repeated to double the height.\n"
