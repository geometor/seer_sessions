The grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors involved seem to be green (3) and white (0). The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input grid, with a border of green (3) added around the original shape, effectively increasing both the height and width.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The copied content will sit two cells from the left edge, and one cell from the top edge.\n\n4.  **Fill the border:** Fill all remaining empty cells (the border created by the expansion) in the new grid with the color green (3).\n\nEssentially it is creating a green border around the original grid.\n"
