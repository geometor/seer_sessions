Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The primary color observed is '8' (azure) against a background of '0' (white). The input grid appears to be smaller than the output grid. The transformation seems to involve some form of expansion or duplication of the input grid, specifically replicating the azure pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - dimensions: (rows, columns)
      - color_map: {0: white, 8: azure}
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Increase the dimensions of the grid.
  - name: replicate
    description: Duplicate existing pixels based on a pattern.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Input grid pixels are mapped to specific locations in the output grid, with a pattern of expansion.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize the input grid as a collection of pixels with colors.
2.  **Expansion:** The input grid will be expanded to an output that seems double in height and width, adding 2 copies of the existing width and height of the input grid.
3.  **Replication Pattern:** Replicate the first and third column once, and then copy the whole pattern, so that it is repeated twice, with one extra row/column in between.

In summary, this transformation is an expansion. The columns are added, so that the first and third are present twice, and then the pattern is repeated to double the height.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
