observations:
  - task: 007bbfb7
  - input_objects:
      - description: Original grid of pixels, each with a specific color.
        properties:
          - colors: [0-9] # All colors can potentially be present
          - shape: rectangular
  - output_objects:
      - description: Expanded grid where each original pixel is represented by a 2x2 block of the same color.
        properties:
          - colors: Same as input_objects
          - shape: rectangular
          - dimensions: Exactly twice the height and width of the input grid.
  - actions:
      - name: Pixel Replication
        description: Each pixel from the input grid is duplicated into a 2x2 block in the output grid.
        details:
          - input_pixel(x, y) -> output_block(2x, 2y, 2x+1, 2y, 2x, 2y+1, 2x+1, 2y+1)
  - relationships:
    - type: one-to-many
      description: Each single pixel in the input corresponds to four pixels (a 2x2 block) in the output.
      details: The color of the 2x2 block matches the original pixel's color.
