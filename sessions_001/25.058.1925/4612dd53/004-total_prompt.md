Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to discern the underlying transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (9x13).
*   The input grid contains 0s (white) and 1s (blue).
*   The output grid contains 0s (white), 1s (blue), and 2s (red).
*   The 1s in the input grid seem to mostly correspond to 1s in the output grid, but some become 2s.
*   The 2s (red) in the output grid appear to be "filling in" or "adjacent to" the 1s (blue) in some way, and the position of the blues may have some importance.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9, 13]
      cell_values: [0, 1, 2]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
      position: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: fill
    description: Change the color of a pixel.
    parameters:
      target_pixel: [row, column]
      new_color: int

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description:  A pixel is adjacent to another pixel if it shares a side or a corner.
  - type: inside_outside
    description: If shape made from a single color is closed, pixels may be considered inside or outside.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions (objects) of blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Maintain Some Blues**: Keep the shape.
3.  **Conditional Fill with Red:** For each white (0) pixel that is *diagonally* adjacent to a blue pixel, it will be filled with color red, if a group of blues make a shape where a given 0 is considered to be inside of the shape, fill with red.

In simpler terms: the transformation seems to preserve the input's blue pixels. The transformation identifies shapes created by blue objects, and changes white cells inside and diagonally adjacent to the blue pixels to red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
