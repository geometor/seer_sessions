Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and try to figure out the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (13x13).
*   The input grid contains only 0s (white) and 1s (blue).
*   The output grid contains 0s (white), 1s (blue), and 2s (red).
*   The blue (1) regions in the input seem to mostly correspond to blue (1) regions in the output.
*   The red (2) pixels in the output seem to appear at the locations that are the borders between two color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 13x13
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 2]
  - name: blue_region
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: irregular
  - name: red_pixel
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - location: border between two color
  - name: white_region
    properties:
        - color: white (0)
        - shape: irregular

actions:
 - name: identify_color
   agent: system
   target: input
   result: set colors of output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** The blue (1) pixels in the input grid are copied to the same positions in the output grid.
2.  **Border Detection:** Iterate through the input grid, find white color (0).
3. **Insert:** For each border, inset a red pixel (2).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
