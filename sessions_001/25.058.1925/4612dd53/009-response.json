The primary objects are clusters of pixels of the same color, forming shapes. There appears to be an interaction, or overlay, of two distinct shapes: one defined by the color blue (1) and another by the color red (2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These pixels collectively form the \"blue shape.\"\n\n2.  **Introduce the Red Overlay:** Imagine or create a \"red shape\" defined as a group of red (2) pixels in the input grid.\n\n3. **Determine Overlap and replacement**: any location of the red color replaces the blue color at that coordinate.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The output grid retains the blue shape, but in all areas where the red color, the value becomes '2' (red). All non-blue, non-red pixels (background - white) remain unchanged.\n"
