There's a consistent band of '5' (gray) pixels across all inputs, separating two regions of the grid.  Above and below this gray band, other colored pixels (non-gray, non-white) appear.  The transformation seems to involve replacing these non-gray, non-white pixels with gray ('5') pixels, and the placement or pattern seems critical.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This band acts as a key reference.\n\n2. **Locate Non-Gray Pixels:** In the regions *above* and *below* the gray band, identify all pixels that are *not* gray (5) and *not* white (0).\n\n3.  **Mirror and Replace with Gray:**\n    *   For the pixels identified in the areas above and below the grey band, if you had a red(2), blue(1) or green(3) pixel in the input, replace them with gray(5) pixels.\n\nIn summary, the transformation replaces specific colored pixels with gray pixels, based on their position relative to the central, constant gray band, mirroring pixels of one color to another position with another color. The key is the replacement and mirror across the gray band.\n"
