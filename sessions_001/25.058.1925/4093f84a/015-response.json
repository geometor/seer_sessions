Both grids are 14x14. The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and gray (5). The transformation seems to involve replacing blue pixels with gray pixels, and some strategic placement and additions of gray pixels. The two solid rows of gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
