objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (0-9)
      properties:
        height: constant within each example
        width: constant within each example
  - pixel:
      type: element within grid
      properties:
          color: determined by integer value
          location: row and column index
  - gray_band:
      type: contiguous block of pixels
      properties:
          color: gray (5)
          shape: horizontal band
          location: spans entire width, fixed rows

actions:
  - replace_color:
      input: pixel location, original color
      output: new color (gray) at same location
  - identify_pattern:
     input: location, color
     output: a flag if location/color matches the replace criteria

relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are adjacent, gray band separates upper and lower regions.
  - conditional: replacement happens based on a color and a location pattern related to the gray band
