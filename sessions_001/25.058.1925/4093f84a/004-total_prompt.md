Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 14x14 grids.
*   **Colors:**  The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and gray (5).
*   **Solid Block:** There's a large horizontal block of gray (5) pixels in the middle of the input grid.
*   **Red Pixels:** Red (2) pixels are scattered seemingly randomly in the white (0) areas of the input.
*   **Transformation:** The red pixels appear to be "replaced" by gray (5) pixels, and their positions relative to the existing gray block seem to dictate the final gray pixel pattern in the output, around the constant gray block.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 14x14
    elements: pixels
    
  - id: gray_block
    type: rectangle
    color: gray (5)
    property: constant
    position: middle rows
    
  - id: red_pixels
    type: individual pixels
    color: red (2)
    property: replaced by gray (5) in output
    
  - id: output_gray_pixels
    type: individual pixels
    color: gray (5)
    property: position corresponds to a red pixel + gray block

relationships:
  - type: replacement
    subject: red_pixels
    object: gray_pixels in output
    
  - type: positional_influence
    subject: red_pixels
    object: gray_pixels in output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the constant horizontal gray (5) block in the middle of the input grid.
2.  **Locate** all red (2) pixels within the input grid.
3.  **Replace** the red (2) pixels from the input grid and copy to the output grid in the same positions, but use gray (5).
4.  The constant horizontal gray (5) block that exists in the input grid is copied unchanged to the output grid.
5. all other cells are white (0)

In simpler terms, the gray block stays the same, and every red pixel's location is copied into the output but with the gray color. White pixels surround this created structure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
