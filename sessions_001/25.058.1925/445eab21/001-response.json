The input grids contain two distinct shapes, each formed by a contiguous block of a single color. One shape is always larger and 'L' shaped, while the smaller shape comprises the output and is always a 2x2 block of the same color. The background is always white (0).  The colors of the shapes vary across examples, but the output always matches the color of the larger \"L\" shaped object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
