examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        red_block: {shape: rectangle, color: red, position: row 6, width: 3}
        yellow_pixel: {shape: single, color: yellow, position: row 8, column 6}
      output_objects:
        red_block: {shape: rectangle, color: red, position: row 7, width: 3}
        yellow_pixel: {shape: single, color: yellow, position: row 8, column 7}
      transformation:
        - The red block moves down by one, staying on the same columns
        - The yellow_pixel moves down by one, and 1 to the right.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        red_block: {shape: rectangle, color: red, position: rows 4-5, width: 2}
        yellow_pixel: {shape: single, color: yellow, position: row 7, column 5}
      output_objects:
        red_block: {shape: rectangle, color: red, position: rows 7-8, width: 2}
        yellow_pixel: {shape: single, color: yellow, position: row 7, column 5}
      transformation:
        - The red block moves to rows 7 and 8, at the same columns
        - The yellow pixel remains in the same place.

  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        red_pixel: {shape: single, color: red, position: row 6, column 4}
        yellow_pixel: {shape: single, color: yellow, position: row 8, column 2}
      output_objects:
        red_pixel: {shape: single, color: red, position: row 7, column 4}
        yellow_pixel: {shape: single, color: yellow, position: row 7, column 2}
      transformation:
        - The red_pixel moves to row 7 in the same column.
        - The yellow_pixel moves to row 7 in the same column.
