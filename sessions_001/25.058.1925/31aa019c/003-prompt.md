Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find the non-zero colored object in the input grid that is closest to the bottom-right corner. Prioritize the lowest row first, and on the same row, choose rightmost item.

2.  **Define Highlighted Region:** Once the target object has been found, create a 3x3 square region, centered on the single pixel of the target object which is not zero, furthest to the bottom and right.

3. **Replace with red:** Every value of the 3x3 square will be replaced by the value `2`

4.  **Clear Background:** Set all pixels *outside* the 3x3 highlighted square to 0 (white).

5. **Preserve the center:** If the target object's center was an existing color, preserve that color.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
