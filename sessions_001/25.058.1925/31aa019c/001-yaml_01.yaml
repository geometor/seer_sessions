objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - cells: pixels (integers 0-9, representing colors)
  - type: background
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
  - type: foreground_objects
    properties:
      - colors: non-zero integers (1-9)
      - shapes: varied (appear to be irregular collections of adjacent pixels)
  - type: highlighted_region
    properties:
      - shape: 3x3 square
      - color_input: any non-zero
      - color_output: 2(red) and possibly the original center
    location: varies, the non-zero color object closest to the bottom right corner

actions:
  - select_region: Identify a region to highlight. The criteria is the lowest, then furthest right non-zero object.
  - replace: other colors with 2(red), except center, which is preserved
  - clear: Set all pixels outside the selected highlighted_region to 0 (white).

relationships:
  - spatial: Pixels are adjacent (up, down, left, right, diagonal).
  - containment: The highlighted_region is a subset of the grid.
  - transformation: input grid transforms into output grid
