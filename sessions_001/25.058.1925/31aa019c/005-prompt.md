Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Target Pixel:** Scan the input grid from bottom-right to top-left. The first non-zero pixel encountered is the "target pixel".

2.  **Create Highlighted Region:** Create a 3x3 square region centered on the target pixel.

3.  **Color Highlighted Region:** Fill the entire 3x3 square with red (value 2), *except* for the center pixel.

4.  **Preserve Center Pixel:** The center pixel of the 3x3 square retains its original color from the input grid.

5.  **Clear Background:** Set all pixels outside the 3x3 square to 0 (white).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
