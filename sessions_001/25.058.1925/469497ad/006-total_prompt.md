Previous Code:
```python
"""
Expand the grid, preserving the central azure square and green border, and filling in the new space with mostly white, and red in specific locations.
"""

import numpy as np

def get_objects_by_color(grid, color):
    """Finds objects of a specific color in the grid."""
    return np.array(np.where(grid == color)).T

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid (double the dimensions)
    output_grid = np.zeros((input_grid.shape[0] * 2, input_grid.shape[1] * 2), dtype=int)

    # Copy Azure Region
    azure_objects = get_objects_by_color(input_grid, 8)
    if len(azure_objects) > 0:
        min_row = np.min(azure_objects[:, 0])
        min_col = np.min(azure_objects[:, 1])
        
        for row in azure_objects:
            output_grid[row[0] + (min_row), row[1] + (min_col)] = 8


    # Copy Green Border
    green_objects = get_objects_by_color(input_grid, 3)
    if len(green_objects) > 0:
        for row in green_objects:

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it seems to have captured some aspects of the transformation, like expanding the grid and copying the green border (though with issues). However, it's clear that the rule for placing the azure square and red pixels is not entirely correct and needs adjustment based on all the examples, not just the first. The core issue is that the code is scaling and translating elements, and not accounting for relative positions to each other.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine all examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair in the training set to identify the consistent rules governing the transformation.
2.  **Object Identification:** Define the key objects (azure square, green border, red pixels) and their properties (size, position) in each input and output.
3.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the re-examination, refine the natural language program to describe the *precise* rules for:
    *   Expanding the grid.
    *   Positioning the azure square in the expanded grid.
    *   Copying and positioning the green border.
    *   Placing the red pixels.
4.  **Iterate on Code:** Translate the refined natural language program into updated code.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To perform this analysis, it is best to check that our assumptions about object
properties are correct.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    """Provides a description of the grid, including size and colors present."""
    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)
    color_descriptions = ", ".join([str(color) for color in unique_colors])
    print(f"  - Size: {grid.shape}")
    print(f"  - Colors Present: {color_descriptions}")

def analyze_example(example_input, example_output, predicted_output):
    """Analyzes a single example."""
    
    print("Input Grid:")
    describe_grid(example_input)
    print(example_input)
    
    print("Output Grid:")
    describe_grid(example_output)
    print(example_output)

    print("Predicted Grid")
    describe_grid(predicted_output)
    print(predicted_output)

# Assuming 'task' contains the training examples
for i, example in enumerate(task["train"]):
    print(f"Example {i + 1}:")
    predicted = transform(np.array(example['input']))
    analyze_example(np.array(example['input']), np.array(example['output']), predicted)
    print("-" * 30)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
