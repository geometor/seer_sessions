Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expand the Grid:** Create a new grid that is three times the width and three times the height of the original grid.
2.  **Fill with Zeros:** Initially, fill the entire expanded grid with zeros (white).
3.  **Replicate Input Colors:** Replicate sections of the input by tiling it three times to the right and three times down
    into sections on the new grid
    - a 3x3 block of red (2) are created toward the top and middle of the new grid in the middle vertically
4. **Result** The resulting expanded grid with the replicated input grid makes the full output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
