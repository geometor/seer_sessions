The core concept appears to be an expansion of the input grid, with the addition of new elements and replication of existing ones. The colored squares within the original input grids seem to define \"objects\" which expand significantly and are then surrounded by frames. The corners of the original object is marked by `2`. The output object is then placed to the left upper part of the output image, while the right bottom of the original images is placed to the right bottom of the output images.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Consider each contiguous block of a single color as a distinct object.\n2.  **Expand main object:** Take the colored region on the upper-left corner as main object. Create a significantly larger rectangular region filled with the same color, and position on the left up of output image.\n3.  **Mark Corners:** Find the corners of the main object before extending, mark the same position with the color '2' (red) in the output image.\n4.  **Copy Bottom-Right:** Identify the colors in a rectangular region at the bottom-right of the input grid.\n5. **Fill Bottom-Right:** Copy the bottom-right portion of the input grid into the bottom right of the output image\n6. Fill other regions in output image with color white, which is `0`.\n\n"
