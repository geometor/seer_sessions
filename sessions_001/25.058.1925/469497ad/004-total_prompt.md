Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (5x5) into a larger grid (10x10).  The input grid seems to contain distinct colored regions: white (0), azure (8), and green (3). The output grid expands these regions and introduces a new color, red (2), in a specific pattern. The azure region in the input appears to be centered, and the green region forms a border on the right and bottom edges. The output grid has a doubled height and width and maintains some of the original color placements, filling the added area strategically.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 5x5
    colors: [white, azure, green]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    colors: [white, azure, green, red]
  - name: azure_region
    type: object
    color: azure
    shape: rectangle
    input_location: center
  - name: green_border
    type: object
    color: green
    input_location: right and bottom edges
  - name: red_border
    type: object
    color: red
    output_location: corners

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Double the dimensions of the grid.
  - name: copy
    description: Copy a color value from the input grid to the output grid.
  - name: fill
    description: Fill a region in the output grid with a specific color.
  - name: maintain
    description: azure square is the same, just copied to the larger grid

relationships:
  - input_grid is transformed into output_grid
  - azure_region is centered in input_grid
  - green_border is on the right and bottom of input_grid
  - output_grid dimensions are double input_grid dimensions
  - red_border is inserted in corners of expanded areas of the grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Expand:** Double the dimensions of the input grid to create the output grid (from 5x5 to 10x10).
2. **Copy Azure Region:** Copy the central 2x2 azure (8) square from the input grid to the corresponding central 4x4 location in the output grid.
3. **Copy Green Border:** Copy the right and bottom green (3) border from the input grid to the corresponding right and bottom edges of the output grid.
4. **Fill with White and Red:** Leave most of the added area created by expanding white (0).
   Add red (2) to the 4 corners created from expanding the grid, maintaining two blank spaces between the red and the green border.

Essentially, the transformation involves expanding the grid, preserving the central azure square and green border, and filling in the new space with a new color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
