Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Expand the Grid:** Create a new grid that is three times the width and three times the height of the original grid.
2.  **Fill with Zeros:** Initially, fill the entire expanded grid with zeros (white).
3.  **Replicate Input Colors:** Replicate sections of the input by tiling it three times to the right and three times down
    into sections on the new grid
    - a 3x3 block of red (2) are created toward the top and middle of the new grid in the middle vertically
4. **Result** The resulting expanded grid with the replicated input grid makes the full output.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 3, input_width * 3
    output_grid = np.zeros((output_height, output_width), dtype=int)

    # change output pixels
    # tile input grid
    for i in range(input_height):
        for j in range(input_width):
            output_grid[i*3:i*3+3, j*3:j*3+3] = input_grid[i,j]

    # add the red squares
    output_grid[0:3, 8] = 2
    output_grid[1:4, 7] = 2
    output_grid[2:5, 6] = 2

    output_grid[9:12, 8] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial `transform` function on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example. While it correctly tiles the input grid, the hardcoded placement of the red squares is incorrect for other examples. The core issue is that the red square placement isn't generalized; it's specific to the dimensions and layout of the first example.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze the Results:** Examine the provided input/output/predicted grids to understand the *actual* relationship between the input and the position of the red squares.
2.  **Identify a Pattern:**  Look for a consistent rule for placing the red squares that holds true across all training examples. The rule might involve the input grid's dimensions, the presence of specific colors, or some other geometric property.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Refactor the natural language program to incorporate the generalized rule for red square placement. We'll aim for a description that's independent of specific grid sizes.
4.  **Prepare for Code Update:**  The YAML facts and the natural language program should provide a clear and concise basis for updating the Python code.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**
I need to do an assessment of properties of the input and output of each of the examples in the training set.
- count input grid pixels by color
- count output grid pixels by color

```tool_code
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

def analyze_grids(task):
    results = []
    for example in task["train"]:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        output_grid = np.array(example['output'])

        input_counts = Counter(input_grid.flatten())
        output_counts = Counter(output_grid.flatten())

        results.append({
            'input_counts': dict(input_counts),
            'output_counts': dict(output_counts),
        })

    return results

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
