The input grid seems to contain distinct colored regions (represented by numbers). The output grid appears to be an expanded version of the input, with added rows and columns of zeros, and some areas filled with repetitions of the original colors. There's a new color introduced (red, value 2) which seem to appear in some regular pattern at the top-left corner.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
