The input grid seems to contain distinct colored regions: white (0), azure (8), and green (3). The output grid expands these regions and introduces a new color, red (2), in a specific pattern. The azure region in the input appears to be centered, and the green region forms a border on the right and bottom edges. The output grid has a doubled height and width and maintains some of the original color placements, filling the added area strategically.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
