The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to focus on a specific color (yellow/4 in this case) and its arrangement. Other colors in the input grid seem to be irrelevant to the output. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input, suggesting a summarization or extraction process.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note their positions. Observe the yellow shapes formed - single pixels or bigger.\n3. **Determine Output Grid Size**: In this example is 3x3.\n4.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. For each yellow object found, preserve relative location on the output, leaving the background white(0). If there are any contiguous yellow pixels, reproduce these in correct relative positions.\n\nIn simpler terms: The output grid is a 3x3 \"zoomed-out\" view of the input grid, showing *only* the relative arrangement of the yellow (4) pixels and keeping any shapes intact. All other colors are discarded, and the background is set to white (0).\n"
