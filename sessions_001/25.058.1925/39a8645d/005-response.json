A cluster is defined as one or more adjacent azure pixels. Adjacency includes diagonals.\n2.  **Determine Output Grid Cell:** For each 3x3 or 4x4 section of the input grid, an azure pixel exists in that section, if place an azure pixel in the output grid, otherwise a white pixel goes to the output grid.\n3. **Ignore other colors.** Red (2) are not considered.\n\nIn simpler terms: The output grid is a 3x3 representation where each cell corresponds to approximately a section of the original image. An azure pixel is present in the output if the relative section contained one or more azure pixels. Red pixels in the input are disregarded.\n"
