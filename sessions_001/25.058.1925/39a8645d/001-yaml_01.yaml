facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grids are of varying rectangular dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Output grids are always 3x3.
  - observation: |
      Input grids contain pixels of various colors (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  - observation: |
      Output grids contain pixels of a single color from the input, and white(0).
  - observation: |
      The selected object appears to be the largest contiguous block of a single non-zero color in the input, ignoring isolated single pixels of that color.
  - observation: |
      The output appears to be a 3x3 representation centered on the selected object shape.
  - object_selection: |
       A 'target' color/object is identified within each input grid.
  - transformation_rule: |
      A 3x3 subgrid is extracted from the input.
  - spatial_relation: |
      The extracted 3x3 grid captures the shape of the target object, padded with 0s, where there aren't pixels of the target color.
