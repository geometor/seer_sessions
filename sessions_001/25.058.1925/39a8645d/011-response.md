Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to focus on a specific color (yellow/4 in this case) and its arrangement. Other colors in the input grid seem to be irrelevant to the output. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input, suggesting a summarization or extraction process.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: [14 x 14]
        elements: [0, 1, 2, 4]
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: [3 x 3]
        elements: [0, 4]
  - type: color_blob
    properties:
        - color: yellow (4)
          shape: varies (single pixels, 2x1 blocks, 2x2 blocks)
          locations: dispersed throughout the input_grid
        - color: blue(1)
        - color: red(2)
        - color: white(0)

actions:
  - extract: Select a specific color (4)
  - summarize:  Condense the input grid based on locations of the color yellow
  - reconstruct: Create output grid with yellow objects at right places and background with white

relationships:
  - input_grid *contains* multiple color_blobs
  - output_grid *represents* a summarized version of the input_grid, focusing on yellow color_blobs
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** The target color for this transformation is yellow (represented by the digit 4).
2.  **Locate Yellow Blobs:** Find all occurrences of the color yellow within the input grid. Note their positions. Observe the yellow shapes formed - single pixels or bigger.
3. **Determine Output Grid Size**: In this example is 3x3.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid. For each yellow object found, preserve relative location on the output, leaving the background white(0). If there are any contiguous yellow pixels, reproduce these in correct relative positions.

In simpler terms: The output grid is a 3x3 "zoomed-out" view of the input grid, showing *only* the relative arrangement of the yellow (4) pixels and keeping any shapes intact. All other colors are discarded, and the background is set to white (0).
