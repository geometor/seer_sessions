Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to extract the top-left *azure* object and center it on a 3x3 grid. This worked for the first training example, but it failed on other examples. The failures highlight these issues:

1.  **Object Selection:** The code is too specific. It only looks for azure (color 8) objects. The other training examples show that other colors must also be selected and not just azure. The concept of the "top-left" object needs to be generalized.
2.  **Output Size:** The output grid is fixed at 3x3. Some examples demonstrate the need for a dynamically sized output based on the selected object.
3. **Background:** The code fills empty space with black (0) - but examples suggest that this should be white

The strategy to address these issues is:

1.  **Generalize Object Selection:** Instead of hardcoding the color azure (8), identify the relevant object based on a more general property. Analyze the examples to determine what characterizes the object to be extracted (e.g., the smallest object, object in top left, etc.)
2.  **Dynamic Output Size:**  Determine the output grid's dimensions based on the size of the extracted object. It could be the same size, or potentially padded.
3.  **Background Color:** Use color 0 (white) for the output background

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the patterns, let's examine each example, describe what *should* happen, note the code's actual output, and pinpoint the discrepancies.

*Example 1*

*   **Input:** A large grid with multiple objects, including an azure L-shaped object in the top-left.
*   **Expected Output:** A 3x3 grid containing only the azure L-shaped object, centered.
*   **Actual Output:** (Correct) A 3x3 grid with the centered azure object.
*   **Observation:** The initial code works correctly in this case.

*Example 2*

*   **Input:** A grid with a single 2x2 red square object.
*   **Expected Output:** A 2x2 grid containing the red square.
*   **Actual Output:** A 3x3 grid with the red square positioned at the top-left, but not centered and has extra row and column filled with black.
*   **Observation:** The code incorrectly assumes a 3x3 output and doesn't handle other object colours or dynamic sizing. The positioning of the copied object should use the same origin, rather than centering, to avoid adding rows/columns.

*Example 3*

*   **Input:** A grid with a 1x2 green rectangle.
*   **Expected Output:** A 1x2 grid with the green rectangle.
*   **Actual Output:** A 3x3 grid. Since there is no azure object the code does not copy any objects.
*   **Observation:** Similar to Example 2, the code fails to handle the correct color and dynamic sizing.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_objects:
    - shape: L-shape
      color: azure
      position: top-left
      size: multi-pixel
  output_objects:
    - shape: L-shape
      color: azure
      position: centered
      size: 3x3
  transformation: "Extract top-left object, center in 3x3 grid."

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - shape: square
      color: red
      position: any
      size: 2x2
  output_objects:
    - shape: square
      color: red
      position: top-left
      size: 2x2
  transformation: "Extract object and place in output grid of same size."

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - shape: rectangle
      color: green
      position: any
      size: 1x2
  output_objects:
    - shape: rectangle
      color: green
      position: top-left
      size: 1x2
  transformation: "Extract object and place in output grid of same size."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Target Object:** Find the *smallest* object in the input grid. If multiple objects have the smallest area, pick the one that starts at the top-most, left-most position. An object is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** Create a new grid that has the exact same dimensions (height and width) as the bounding box of the target object identified in Step 1.
3. **Copy the object:** Fill background with white (0). Copy all of the pixels of the target object into the output grid, using the same row and column indices to maintain relative position.

This revised program addresses the limitations of the initial code by generalizing object selection, dynamically sizing the output, and using the correct background. It focuses on copying the smallest object to a new canvas of the same dimensions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
