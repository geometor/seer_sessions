The primary colors present are blue (1), white (0), azure (8), and in the output, green (3). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The most noticeable change is within the region where azure (8) was present; some of those pixels are now green (3). The overall layout, other than changing some 8s to 3s, is unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
