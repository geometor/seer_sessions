Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify the Frame: The grid is enclosed by a frame of azure (8) pixels.
2. Identify Inner Pixels:  Locate all pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to the azure frame.
3. Consistent Color Change:  For each example, determine the *single* color that *all* the inner pixels change *to*. If, in the input, an inner pixel has color X, and in the output that same pixel has color Y, *all* pixels adjacent to the frame that were color X in the input become color Y in the output.
4. Apply Transformation: Change the color of inner pixels that match the input criteria.
5. Preserve Frame: The azure frame remains unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
