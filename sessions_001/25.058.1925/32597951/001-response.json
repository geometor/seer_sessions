The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and green (3). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The most prominent change appears to be the replacement of some azure (8) pixels with green (3) pixels, seemingly within blue (1) surrounded areas.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

An azure region is considered \"enclosed\" if all of its neighboring pixels are blue (1).\n3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If an azure region is completely enclosed by blue pixels, some of the azure pixels may be converted to green (3). It appears this process is done on some of the 8's, converting to a three, while maintaining the original shape formed by blue pixels.\n\nThe transformation rule can be summarized as: \"Change some of the color of enclosed azure (8) regions to green (3), within the bounding shape of blue (1) pixels.\"\n"
