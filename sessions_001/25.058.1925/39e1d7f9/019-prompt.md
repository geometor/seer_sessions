```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of the same color in the input grid.
2.  **Filter Objects**: Select only the 3x3 objects that have a color of 2 or 4.
3. **Vertical Stacking**: Identify sets of 3x3 objects of color 2 or color 4 that are stacked vertically.
4.  **Conditional Swap:** Within each set of vertically stacked 3x3 objects, swap colors 2 (red) and 4 (yellow). That is:
    *   Change all pixels of color 2 within those objects to color 4.
    *   Change all pixels of color 4 within those objects to color 2.
5. **Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
