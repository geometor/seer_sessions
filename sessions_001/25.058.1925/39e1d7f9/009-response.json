The dominant colors are green (3), white (0), magenta (6), and yellow (4). There are distinct rectangular shapes formed by the magenta and yellow pixels, all surrounded by green. The output appears to be a modified version of the input, with some magenta pixels shifting positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Some rectangles are made of magenta (6) pixels and some are made of yellow(4) pixels.\n\n3. **Horizontal Shift:** All of the magenta rectangles, except the ones that includes yellow rectangles inside of a bigger rectangle, are shifted one cell, horizontally, to the right.\n\n4.  **Output:** The shifted magenta rectangles, alongside the original yellow, and background green constitute the final output.\n\nIn essence, the program finds the rectangles and shift some of the magenta color one pixel right.\n"
