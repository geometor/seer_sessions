task: d51b7ecc
facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves swapping colors 2 (red) and 4 (yellow) conditionally.
  - condition: |
      The swap only occurs with objects that have dimensions of exactly 3x3, are vertically stacked, and have colors 2 or 4.
  - object_identification: |
      Objects are contiguous regions of the same color.
  - action: |
      If the conditions of size and colors 2 or 4 are met, swap color 2 with 4 and color 4 with 2.
  - constraints: |
      The transformation is localized to 3x3 objects of color 2 or 4.
