            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples. The initial natural language program and code focused on shifting magenta rectangles one cell to the right, unless they contained yellow rectangles. We need to see how this holds up across all examples and adjust accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code seems to capture a part of the transformation rule but likely misses nuances that become apparent in other training examples. The strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully analyze each input/output pair, paying close attention to the differences between the predicted output (from running `transform` on the input) and the actual, expected output.\n2.  **Identify Discrepancies:** Pinpoint where the code's logic fails to produce the correct result. This could involve incorrect object identification, incorrect shifting, or missing operations entirely.\n3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the discrepancies, update the natural language program to more accurately describe the transformation rule. This refined description should encompass all observed behaviors.\n4. **Prepare the YAML and updated NL Program:** Prepare the requested deliverables.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Example Analysis**\n\nI need to execute the code on each of the training examples, and compare the produced output with the target output provided in the example to generate metrics. I will focus on identifying objects.\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Provided code (transform, find_objects, is_rectangle, shift_object) - pasted here for execution\n# ...
