Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The most prominent visual elements are:

1.  **Background:** A consistent background that is either azure (8) or white(0) that has solid filled horizontal bars, 4 rows thick.
2. **Rectangular Shapes:** There are filled rectangles of different colors.
3.  **Color Changes:** Certain colors within the rectangles seem to be swapped or altered.
4.  **Consistent Grid Structure**: The overall grid dimensions and the positions of solid filled horizontal bar shape relative to rectangular shapes, remain consistent between input and output.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [rows, cols] #variable
      background_color: [0 or 8] # white or azure
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      color: [integer] # 0-9, representing a color
      position: [top_left_row, top_left_col]
      dimensions: [height, width]
    relations:
      - inside: grid
actions:
  - type: color_swap
    parameters:
      original_color: [integer]
      new_color: [integer]
    conditions:
      location: inside_rectangle # color swap occurs inside rect.
  - type: reposition
    parameters:
        object_id:
        new_position:
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Find all filled rectangular shapes within the grid, excluding horizontal bar shapes.
2.  **Color Swap within rectangels:**
    *   In train\_1, inside each rectangle, swap magenta (6) with green (3)
    *   In train\_2, inside each rectangle, swap magenta(6) with yellow(4) at specific locations, swap yellow(4) with magenta(6) at specific locations, swap all other non-magenta(6) and non-yellow(4) with green(3).
    *   In train\_3, inside each rectangle, swap yellow(4) with red(2) at specific locations, swap red(2) with yellow(4) at specific locations, swap all other non-red(2) and non-yellow(4) with azure(8) .
3.  **Reposition Rectangles**
    * In all three training examples, the positions of the rectangles are changed by reflecting across the main diagonal, while the size stays the same.

4. **Horizontal bars stay at their original location, and will be overwritten by the shapes if their new locations are overlapped**.

In short terms, the input has rectangles whose color changed to another color, and the rectangles are moved to new locations by reflection over main diagonal.
