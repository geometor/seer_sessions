"""
The transformation rule is to keep all pixels that are not white (color code 0) in their original position within the grid. The white pixels are, effectively, removed, but this *doesn't* cause a shift or compaction of any kind of the other pixels. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, and non-white pixels are in the exact same locations.
