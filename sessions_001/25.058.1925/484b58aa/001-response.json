The most obvious visual feature is the presence of large areas of white (0) pixels in the input grids that disappear in the output grids. The colored pixels surrounding and interspersed with the white pixels seem to maintain their relative positions and colors. The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant between input and output. This suggests a filling or removal operation related to the white pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

A contiguous region is defined as a group of white pixels connected horizontally or vertically.\n2.  **Remove** those white regions.\n3.  **Preserve** all non-white pixels (colors 1-9) in their original positions within the grid. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, and the non-white pixels maintain their locations. In effect, the removal of the white pixels simply removes them and does not cause the surrounding pixels to shift, collapse, or change.\n\nIn essence, the transformation is a simple \"removal of contiguous white regions\", leaving the colored pixels untouched.\n"
