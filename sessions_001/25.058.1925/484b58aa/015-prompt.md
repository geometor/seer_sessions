Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to keep all pixels that are not white (color code 0) in their original position within the grid. The white pixels are, effectively, removed, but this *doesn't* cause a shift or compaction of any kind of the other pixels. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, and non-white pixels are in the exact same locations.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by keeping only the non-white pixels in their
    original positions.

    Args:
        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A 2D numpy array representing the output grid with only non-white
        pixels in their original positions.
    """
    # Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through the grid and keep only non-white pixel
    for row_index in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for col_index in range(output_grid.shape[1]):

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
