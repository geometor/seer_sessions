facts:
  - observation: |
      Each example consists of an input grid and a corresponding output grid.
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain multiple objects, where an object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.  The background is always black (color 0).
  - observation: |
      The output grids always consists of exactly one object of one color, which is a solid block copied from a region of the input.
  - observation: |
      The output grid dimensions are consistently smaller than the input grid dimensions.  The output dimensions correspond to the size of the colored object extracted from the input.
  - observation: |
      In all training examples, the input grid contains a single contiguous non-black region.
  - rule: |
      The transformation extracts the non-black object from the input grid and places it into the output grid.
  - rule: |
      The position in the input does not matter.
  - rule: |
      The output grid is sized to fit the object exactly.
