Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors. The dominant colors are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The input grid contains a blue shape at the top and a disjointed red shape at the bottom. The output grid seems to consolidate the red into the blue shape, seemingly "transferring" the red color upwards. The overall grid size remains the same.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      cols: 10
      colors: [0, 1, 2] # White, Blue, Red
  - type: shape
    id: blue_shape
    color: 1
    properties:
      location: top
      contiguous: true
  - type: shape
    id: red_shape_input
    color: 2
    properties:
      location: bottom
      contiguous: false # In the input, the red shape consists of separate parts
  - type: shape
    id: red_shape_output
    color: 2
    properties:
      location: within_blue_shape
      contiguous: true
      
actions:
  - name: transfer_color
    source: red_shape_input
    target: blue_shape
    result: red_shape_output # The red color 'moves' into the blue shape

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Red shape (input) is below the blue shape."
  - type: containment
    description: "Red shape (output) is contained within the outline of the original blue shape, extending its outline where necessary."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find two distinct colored shapes: a contiguous blue shape (color 1) and a potentially non-contiguous red shape (color 2). The remaining pixels are white (color 0).

2.  **Locate Red:** Find the red pixels (color 2) in the input grid.

3.  **Transfer:**  For each red pixel in the input, find the closest blue pixel (color 1) located vertically upwards from the original red position and change that pixel and possibly some of the pixels below to be 2. If a blue pixel already has a red color, just change the blue pixels upwards from that position, too. If there is no blue pixel to find, traverse up to the same height as where the blue region started and find the nearest blue pixel.

4.  **Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. Copy the original blue and white pixels from the input to the output. Then set pixels based on previous step.

In simpler term, move all reds upwards within or adjacent to the original outline of blue pixels, creating a contiguous red shape. The blue pixels are changed to be red until the height of input red is reached.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
