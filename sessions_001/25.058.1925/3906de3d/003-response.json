Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). There's a noticeable change in the position and extent of the red color between the input and output. The blue region remains constant, while some white regions remain white, others may be occupied.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It does not move or change.\n\n3. **Find Blue's Lowest Extent:** determine the lowest row value occupied by the Blue Region.\n\n4.  **Red Region Movement:** The red region, initially located at the bottom, moves upwards.\n\n5.  **Red Region New Location**: The red region moves up and takes the column location of its initial position. It moves so that its new top y coordinate is now the same as the bottom of the identified blue region.\n\n6.  **Output Construction:** Combine the static blue region and the repositioned red region to form the output grid. The white areas are the same as input, unless occupied by the new red object.\n"
