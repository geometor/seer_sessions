The input grid contains three distinct colors: white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The output grid also contains the same three colors but in a different arrangement. It appears the transformation involves a color swap and possibly some movement or shifting of colored regions based on location. I need to find what triggers those shifts.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

Inside that region, search for white pixels (0).
