The background is white (0). The core transformation seems to involve an interaction, or perhaps a transfer of properties, between the blue and red objects. Specifically, the red object's position or shape appears to influence the placement of red pixels within the blue object's area.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Note the shape and position of both.\n2.  **Transfer Property:** Transfer \"redness\" to any blue pixel directly above a red pixel. The red pixels from the blue object should replace the lowest blue pixels that are immediately \"above\", the original red pixels, in the corresponding input column.\n3.  **Remove Source object:** The separate red object at the bottom is removed in the output.\n\nIn essence, the red object \"projects\" its shape upwards onto the blue object, replacing some of the blue pixels with red ones, and then disappears. The background remains unchanged.\n"
