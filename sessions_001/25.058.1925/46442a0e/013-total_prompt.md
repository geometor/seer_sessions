Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Duplicate:** For every pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid.
2.  **Mirror Horizontally:**  Create a horizontal mirror image of the expanded grid from step 1.
3.  **Concatenate Horizontally:** Combine the expanded grid (step 1) with its horizontal mirror (step 2), placing the mirrored image to the *right* of the original.
4.  **Mirror Vertically:** Create a vertical mirror image of the horizontally concatenated grid from step 3.
5. **Concatenate Vertically**: Combine the horizontally concatenated grid (step 3) with its vertical mirror (step 4), placing the mirrored version *below* the horizontally combined grid. The final output size will *always* be twice the width and twice the height of the input.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
