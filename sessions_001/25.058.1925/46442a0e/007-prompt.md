Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule replicates the input grid to produce an output grid that is twice the size in both dimensions. The input grid acts as a tile that is repeated four times (2x2) to create the output grid. The pattern of colors and objects within the input grid is maintained during this replication.

    # Determine Input Dimensions: Get the height and width of the input grid.
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Calculate Output Dimensions: Multiply both the height and width by two to get the output grid's dimensions.
    output_height, output_width = input_height * 2, input_width * 2

    # Create Output Grid: Initialize an empty output grid with the calculated dimensions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
