            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example and made specific assumptions, particularly about the location and expansion of the 2x2 yellow core and how the input rows and columns map to the output. The results across all examples show that these assumptions are not universally valid. The strategy needs to shift from hardcoding positions to dynamically identifying relationships and applying transformations based on those relationships. My assumptions about extending the last row were not quite correct and that needs to be revised.\n\nThe core concept of a central 2x2 yellow core that expands to 4x4 seems correct. The primary issue is the row/column duplication. Instead of assuming which rows/columns to copy, we need to generalize based on position relative to the core. It is important to avoid using specific coordinates when generalizing.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including the code execution results to gather accurate metrics:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef code_execution(input_grid, expected_output, predicted_output):\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)\n    predicted_output = np.array(predicted_output)\n\n    input_shape = input_grid.shape\n    output_shape = expected_output.shape\n    predicted_shape = predicted_output.shape\n\n    # Find the 2x2 yellow (4) core in the input grid.\n    input_core = find_core(input_grid) if find_core(input_grid) is not None else \"Not Found\"\n    expected_core = find_core(expected_output) if find_core(expected_output) is not None else \"Not Found\"\n    predicted_core = find_core(predicted_output) if find_core(predicted_output) is not None else \"Not Found\"\n   \n    # Check if prediction matches the expected output\n    match = np.array_equal(expected_output, predicted_output)\n\n    return {\n        \"input_shape\": input_shape,\n        \"output_shape\": output_shape,\n        \"predicted_shape\": predicted_shape,\n        \"input_core\": input_core,\n        \"expected_core\": expected_core,\n        \"predicted_core\": predicted_core,\n        \"match\": match\n    }\n\ndef find_core(grid):\n    # Find the 2x2 yellow (4) core in the input grid.

This core serves as the anchor for the transformation.\n2.  **Expand the Core:** Expand the 2x2 core to a 4x4 square of yellow pixels. The output grid will almost always be larger that the input grid, but not in every case.\n3. **Copy Adjacent Rows:** Copy the row immediately *above* the 2x2 core in the input grid to the row immediately *above* the 4x4 expanded core in the output grid. Similarly, copy the row immediately *below* the core in the input grid to the row immediately *below* the expanded core in the output grid.\n4.  **Copy Adjacent Columns:** Copy the column immediately to the *left* of the 2x2 core in the input grid to the column immediately to the *left* of the 4x4 expanded core in the output grid. Similarly, copy the column immediately to the *right* of the core in the input grid to the column immediately to the *right* of the expanded core in the output grid.\n5. **Output Dimensions:** If copying would require exceeding the bounds of a 6x6 grid, limit output to 6x6. If the input grid is already larger than 6x6 return the input unchanged. If the expanded core would be larger than the input grid, return the input unchanged.\n\nThis revised natural language program addresses the issues observed in the examples by focusing on relative positioning rather than fixed indices. It describes a more general rule applicable to various core positions and input grid sizes.\n"
