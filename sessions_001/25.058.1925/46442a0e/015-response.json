The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The input grid is smaller (3x3) than the output grid (6x6). The output grid appears to be some sort of expansion or combination of the input grid, with additional elements. There's a noticeable symmetry and repetition of colors in the output. The input grid has three distinct colors, which are also present in the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

These appear as columns 1 and 6, respectively.\n4. **Mirror/Duplicate Rows:** Take the last row, including the new mirrored elements and mirror it into the top row. Duplicate it and make a new bottom row.\n\nIn short: Expand core and then reflect input rows and columns to create larger output.\n"
