"""
1. **Identify Dominant Colors:** Divide the input grid conceptually into vertical sections.  It appears the intent is to have three sections corresponding to the colors in the output.
2.  **Determine Color Order:** For each vertical section, identify the most frequently occurring color (the dominant color).
3.  **Create Output:** Construct a 1x3 output grid.  The first cell should contain the value of the dominant color from the leftmost section of the input, the second cell should contain the value of the dominant color from the middle section, and the third cell should have the value of the dominant color in the rightmost section.
