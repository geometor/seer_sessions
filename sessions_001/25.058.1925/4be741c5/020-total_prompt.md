Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to find nested squares and extract the color of the innermost square's center pixel. This approach works for some cases (specifically, where nested squares are present), but it fails when the underlying pattern is different. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis (nested squares) is too narrow. We need to broaden our perspective and look for more general patterns that can account for all the examples.

My strategy will be to:

1.  **Analyze each example:** Examine the input, expected output, and actual output. Note any discrepancies.
2.  **Identify common features:** Look for patterns that hold true across *all* successful examples.
3.  **Refine the hypothesis:** Formulate a new, more general rule that explains all the input-output transformations.
4.  **Express the rule:** Create a natural language program describing the new rule.
5.  **YAML the details** Construct a yaml document representing the transformation.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To help me better analyze the input and output grids, I will create small python programs to give metics for each of the grids.

Here's a breakdown of each training example, including the results of the current code and some additional analysis:

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def grid_dims(grid):
    return len(grid), len(grid[0])

def get_colors(grid):
     return list(np.unique(np.array(grid)))

def describe_grid(grid, name):
    dims = grid_dims(grid)
    colors = get_colors(grid)
    print(f"{name}:")
    print(f"  Dimensions: {dims[0]}x{dims[1]}")
    print(f"  Colors: {colors}")

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
