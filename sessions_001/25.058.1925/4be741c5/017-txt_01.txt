    [[blue, blue, blue],
     [blue, blue, blue],
     [blue, blue, blue]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** 3x1 grid: `[[blue]]`
*   **Actual Output:** `[[blue]]`
*   **Observation:** The initial code correctly identifies the single unique color.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Input dimensions: 3x3
    *   Output dimensions: 1x1 (initial code produced 1x1)
    *   Unique Colors: 1

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** 4x4 grid:
    ```
    [[black, black, black, black],
    [black, red,   red,   black],
    [black, red,   red,   black],
    [black, black, black, black]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** 2x2:
    ```
    [[red, red],
    [red, red]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:** `[[black], [red]]`
*   **Observation:** Code extracts unique colors, but the expected output is the inner red square. We identify that there is a large black border and a central shape.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   Input dimensions: 4x4
    *   Output dimensions: 2x2
    *   Unique Colors: 2

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** 5x5 grid:
    ```
     [[green, green, green, green, green],
      [green, black, black, black, green],
      [green, black, blue,  black, green],
      [green, black, black, black, green],
      [green, green, green, green, green]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:** 1x1:
    ```
    [[blue]]
    ```
*   **Actual Output:** `[[green], [black], [blue]]`
*   **Observation:** Similar to the previous case. The code extracts color, but the expected is only the single inner color. The input has nested shapes.
*    **Metrics:**
    *   Input dimensions: 5x5
    *   Output Dimensions: 1x1
    *   Unique Colors: 3
