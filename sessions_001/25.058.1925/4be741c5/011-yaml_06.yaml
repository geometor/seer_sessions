          The output grid is a single column. The height corresponds to first
          row. The output contains each unique color of the row, maintaining
          their order of appearance.  This is repeated for all rows, top to
          bottom, in the input.

        The output grid is a single column. The height corresponds to first

        The output grid is a single row. The width corresponds to the width
        of the input. The output contains each unique color of the row,
        maintaining their order of appearance. This is repeated for each row of
        the input, but only the first row is kept.
