        input_objects: [Contiguous region of color 5, Contiguous region of color 0, Contiguous region of color 5]
        output_objects: [Single row of colors representing the dominant color of each contiguous region]
        actions: [Divide input into contiguous color regions, Extract dominant color from each region, Create output row]
        notes: "Correctly identifies the three regions and their dominant colors."

        actions: [Divide input into contiguous color regions, Extract dominant color from each region, Create output row]
        notes: "Correctly identifies only *two* regions, resulting in 1x2 output.  The original algorithm incorrectly produced 1x3 output."
