Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Contiguous Horizontal Regions:** Traverse the input grid from left to right, identifying contiguous horizontal regions of the same color. A "region" is defined as a sequence of adjacent cells in a row having the same color.  If a new color is encountered, that marks the beginning of a new region.
2.  **Determine Dominant Color per Region:** For each identified contiguous region, determine its dominant color (which will be the only color in that region, by definition).
3.  **Create Output Row:** Construct a 1 x N output grid, where N is the number of contiguous regions found in the input grid.  Each cell in the output grid represents a region.
4.  **Populate Output:** Fill each cell of the output grid with the dominant color of the corresponding region identified in Step 2. The order of the cells in the output grid should match the order of the regions in the input grid (from left to right).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program focused on identifying contiguous horizontal regions of the same color and creating an output row representing the *unique* colors of those regions. While this worked for the first example, it failed on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the program doesn't simply extract *unique* colors; instead, it consolidates runs, including adjacent segments of the same color. It considers all rows together, rather than generating a result based on a row by row basis.

Here's the refined strategy:

1.  **Row-wise Processing:** The transformation needs to be performed row by row, not across the entire grid at once. Each row in the input should independently produce a corresponding row (or a segment of the single output row).
2.  **Adjacent Runs of Same Color:** Instead of collecting unique colors, focus should be made on all runs of the same color, even if adjacent.
3.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid dimensions should match the specification given by each example.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Process Input Row by Row:** Iterate through each row of the input grid independently.
2.  **Identify Contiguous Regions:** Within each row, identify contiguous regions (runs) of pixels having the same color.  A new region starts when a different color is encountered, or the end of the row.
3.  **Create Output Segments:** For each input row, create a corresponding segment (a 1D array) for the output. Each element in the segment corresponds to a region, and its value equals to that region's color.
4.  **Combine:** Create the output grid. The number of rows in the output should match the number of contiguous regions found in *all* input rows, concatenated together. Each cell in the output should be the color of the region it represents.

Essentially the algorithm is run on each row of input, and the 1-d outputs are
concatenated together to make the final output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
