observations:
  - example: 1
    input_size: 5x8
    output_size: 5x8
    magenta_input: [[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1], [4, 0], [4, 7]]
    red_output:  "diagonal from top right, length equal to input height"
    yellow_output: "fills cells below red"
    notes: "Output dimensions match input. Red pixels form a diagonal line in the last columns. Yellow fills the spaces below red."

  - example: 2
    input_size: 5x9
    output_size: 4x9
    magenta_input: [[0, 3], [0, 7], [3, 0], [3, 8]]
    red_output: "appears in last column and extends left; some in first column"
    yellow_output: "fills cells below red"
    notes: "Output height is one less than input. Red and Yellow interleave."

  - example: 3
    input_size: 5x8
    output_size: 4x8
    magenta_input: [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1], [4, 0]]
    red_output: "diagonal from top right"
    yellow_output: "fills cells below red"
    notes: "Output height is one less than input. Red and Yellow interleave. Red is in a diagonal, above yellow."

rules:
    output_height: "input height or input height - 1"
    red_placement: "Starts at the top-right corner of the OUTPUT grid.  Extends diagonally down and to the left. Stops based on output width"
    yellow_placement: "Fills the grid below the red line"
    magenta: "removed from output"
