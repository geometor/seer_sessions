The input grid contains two colors: gray (5) and white (0). The output grid introduces two new colors: red (2) and yellow (4), while retaining some of the original colors in specific locations. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple replacement of all pixels of one color with another, but rather a more localized change. The white pixels are replaced based on their proximity to gray.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
