Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Gray Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are gray (value 5). These are the "anchor" or "source" pixels for the transformation.

2.  **Conditional White Pixel Replacement:** Iterate through the white (value 0) pixels in the input grid.
  * if a white pixel is at the top right corner, replace with red.
  * if a white pixel is below a gray pixel AND to the right of a gray pixel, replace with yellow
  * if a white pixel is to the right of a gray AND above a yellow, replace with red.
  * if a white pixel is under a gray AND to the left of a yellow, replace with red.

3.  **Preserve Gray Pixels:** The gray pixels from the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
