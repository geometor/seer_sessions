            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved finding a leftmost azure column, drawing a red diagonal, and filling the bottom row with yellow. However, the other training examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The transformation doesn't *always* involve a red diagonal and yellow bottom row. The key seems to be the presence of an azure column, *and* the position of this relative to existing red pixels, if there are any. The current code fails to correctly handle the case where there's interaction with existing red colors. The code needs refactoring to account for all of the rules, specifically the optional nature of some steps and dependence on existing red shapes in the grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, I'll describe the input, expected output, actual output, and identify the discrepancies. I will look for patterns that will allow the program to execute for all examples.\n2. **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML document with more specific observations about object interactions (azure and red, specifically).\n3. **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately capture the complete transformation logic, incorporating the new observations. Specifically, consider how existing red cells interact with a leftmost azure column, as they don't always create a diagonal.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo better understand, let us review the results of code_execution in the previous step.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Contains a leftmost azure column.\n    *   Expected Output: Red diagonal from the top intersecting azure column, yellow bottom row.\n    *   Actual Output: Matches expected output.\n    *   Discrepancy: None.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Contains a leftmost azure column and pre-existing red cells.\n    *   Expected Output: The red cells have been extended by one red cell diagonally.\n    *   Actual Output: Red diagonal from the top intersecting azure column, yellow bottom row.\n    *   Discrepancy: Actual output does not match the expectation, includes extraneous red cells and yellow bottom row. The rule is contingent upon the presence of other red cells in specific positions.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: No azure column.\n    *   Expected Output: Input grid unchanged.\n    *   Actual Output: Matches expected output.\n    *   Discrepancy: None.\n\n**YAML Observations:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: azure_column\n    description: A vertical line of azure (8) pixels.\n    properties:\n      - leftmost: True  # The column furthest to the left in the grid.\n      - complete: True  # all cells in the column are azure\n  - object: red_pixel\n    description: A pixel of red (2) color.\n    properties:\n      - position: [row, col]  # The row and column index of the pixel.\n  - action: extend_red\n    description: >-\n      If a leftmost azure column exists, AND, there is an existing shape\n      of red cells, extend the red cells diagonally down and to the left\n      by a single red cell.\n    preconditions:\n      - azure_column exists and is leftmost.\n      - red shape exists\n    postconditions:\n       - extend the red shape by one cell\n  - action: no_change\n    description: if there is no azure column, there is no change\n    preconditions:\n      - azure_column does not exists\n    postconditions:\n      - input grid is return unchanged\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Leftmost Azure Column:** Scan the input grid to find the leftmost column consisting entirely of azure (8) pixels.\n\n2.  **Check for Existing Red Shape:** Determine if the are any shapes of red (2) cells.\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformation:**\n    *   **If a leftmost azure column exists AND an existing red shape exists:** Extend the red shape down and to the left, diagonally, by one red cell.\n    *   **If no azure column is found:** Return the input grid unchanged.\n"
