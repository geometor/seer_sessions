The input grid consists primarily of '8' (azure) and '0' (white) values. The output grid introduces '2' (red) and '4' (yellow) values, seemingly based on the positions of the '8's in the input. There appears to be a diagonal relationship or pattern involved, and the bottom row changes completely to yellow.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
