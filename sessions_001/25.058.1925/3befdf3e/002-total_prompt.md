**Perception of Elements**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit (0-9), representing a color. The transformation appears to operate on a central "object" within the grid, expanding it outwards while also shifting other pixels. The core concept seems to be an "inner" shape surrounded by an "outer" shape. The transformation expands the inner shape and adjusts the outer shape accordingly. The background (pixels with value 0) remains largely unchanged, except where the expanding shapes take over.

**YAML Fact Documentation**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: inner_shape
    properties:
      - color: varies (6 in example 1, 7 in example 2, 1 in example 3)
      - shape: contiguous block, typically square-like
      - location: centered within the outer_shape
    actions:
      - expands: grows outwards by one layer
  - object: outer_shape
    properties:
      - color: varies (4 in example 1, 2 in example 2, 3 in example 3)
      - shape: surrounds the inner_shape, forming a border
      - location: adjacent to the inner_shape
    actions:
      - shifts: moves outwards to accommodate the expanding inner_shape, maintaining its border shape
  - object: background
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - shape: fills the remaining grid space
    actions:
      - passive: remains unchanged unless overwritten by expanding shapes

  - relation: inner_outer_adjacency
    description: The outer_shape is directly adjacent to the inner_shape, forming a continuous border.

  - relation: background_fill
    description: the background occupies all the cells not containing an object

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Inner Shape:** Locate the contiguous block of pixels at the center of the grid that has a different color than its immediate surrounding pixels (the outer shape).

2.  **Identify the Outer Shape:** Identify the contiguous block of pixels that directly surrounds and is adjacent to the inner shape.

3.  **Expand the Inner Shape:** Replace the pixels of the outer shape, which is directly adjacent to original inner shape, with the original color of the inner shape.

4.  **Shift the Outer Shape:** Create a new outer border by replacing background colored (0) which is direct adjacent to the new inner shape. The new border is same color as the original outer shape.

5.  **Background Remains:** All other pixels, which represent the background (value 0), remain unchanged.

In summary, the inner shape expands by one layer, consuming the innermost layer of the outer shape. The outer shape then shifts outwards by one layer, maintaining its original color. The background (0) is preserved except where overwritten by expansion.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
