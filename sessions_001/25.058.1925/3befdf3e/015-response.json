The primary colors involved are green (3), blue (1), and white (0). There's a clear geometric structure: a green rectangle encloses a blue rectangle in the input. The output seems to be a modified version of this structure, with an expansion and some color changes. The transformation is not a simple rotation or reflection. It appears that it might involve an operation to expand around the perimeter of an inner object and transfer properties of adjacent objects.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This is done by expanding the inner rectangle by one cell in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).\n3.  **Property Transfer** The region of expansion takes the background color and copies the colors on cells adjacent to the original outer object, in this case the original outer rectangle.
