Identify the Inner Shape: Locate the contiguous block of pixels at the center of the grid that has a different color than its immediate surrounding pixels (the outer shape).\n2. Identify the Outer Shape: Identify the contiguous block of pixels that directly surrounds and is adjacent to the inner shape.\n3. Expand the Inner Shape: Replace the pixels of the outer shape, which is directly adjacent to original inner shape, with the original color of the inner shape.\n4. Shift the Outer Shape: Create a new outer border by replacing background colored (0) which is direct adjacent to the new inner shape. The new border is same color as the original outer shape.\n5. Background Remains: All other pixels, which represent the background (value 0), remain unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef find_object(grid, start_row, start_col):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a contiguous object in the grid starting from a given cell,\n    using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    queue = deque([(start_row, start_col)])\n    visited[start_row, start_col] = True\n    object_pixels = []\n    color = grid[start_row, start_col]\n\n    while queue:\n        r, c = queue.popleft()\n        object_pixels.append((r, c))\n\n        # Check adjacent cells\n        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and not visited[nr, nc] and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                queue.append((nr, nc))\n\n    return object_pixels, color\n    \ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    get all the valid neighbors of a cell, regardless of color\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbors.append((nr,nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef find_inner_and_outer_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the inner and outer objects based on the center and adjacency.\n    Assumes there's an inner and outer shape.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    center_row, center_col = rows // 2, cols // 2\n    \n    # Find what is in the center of grid\n    if grid[center_row,center_col] == 0:\n        return None, None, None, None\n    \n    inner_object, inner_color = find_object(grid, center_row, center_col)\n    \n    # use first neighbor that is not the same color to start to define outer\n    outer_color = None\n    outer_start = None\n    \n    for r,c in inner_object:\n        for nr, nc in get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n            if grid[nr,nc] != inner_color:\n                outer_start = (nr,nc)\n                outer_color = grid[nr,nc]\n                break # found outer, done searching\n        if outer_start:\n            break\n    \n    if not outer_start: # no outer found, we are done\n        return None, None, None, None\n        \n    outer_object, _ = find_object(grid, outer_start[0], outer_start[1])\n    \n    return inner_object, inner_color, outer_object, outer_color\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Expands the inner shape by one layer, consuming the innermost layer of the\n    outer shape.
