Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** the central red square (color 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** the central orange square (color 7) within the red square.
3.  **Expand** the red square. The original red square expands by adding red color on the outside in a single layer expansion. The red area makes contact with the original shape on all sides.
4.  **Invert** the orange square. Take the orange 2x2 square and make it's corners orange, and the center red.
5.  **Combine**: The expanded red square and modified orange square form a "single object."
6. The positions relative to one another are maintained.
7.  **Place** the resulting combined shape in the center of the output grid, replacing the corresponding pixels in the input grid.
8. The background is unchanged.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
