The input and output grids have the same dimensions. There are multiple distinct colored \"objects\" within the grid, which seem to be defined by contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. The primary colors present are blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4), along with white/background (0). There's an apparent interaction or modification of existing yellow object.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
