```python
"""
The transformation preserves the main yellow (4) and small blue (1) shapes in the input grid. 
It adds a single blue (1) pixel above the rightmost part of the yellow shape and green (3) pixels above and below the leftmost part of the yellow shape. 
A blue pixel is inserted within the yellow shape, one cell above the bottom, while a green shape replaces part of the original yellow shape two cells from the top.
It also adds a green shape to the right of the grid.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to address the discrepancies:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code captured some key aspects of the transformation, particularly the manipulation of the yellow and blue shapes. However, it failed to generalize correctly to all training examples. The issues stem from:

1.  **Incorrect Assumptions about Shape Modification:** The code assumes specific positions for inserting blue and green pixels within and around the yellow shape. These positions vary across examples.
2.  **Hardcoded Indices:** Absolute positioning (e.g., `output_grid[max_row -1, 8] = 3`) is used, which doesn't adapt to different grid sizes or shape positions. The attempt to add the extra L shape is incorrect.
3.  **Incomplete Object Identification:** The code uses a rudimentary object identification that will not generalize.
4.  Lack of understanding on where to position additional shapes relative to existing shapes.

The strategy for resolving these errors involves:

1.  **Improved Object Recognition:** Use a more robust method by detecting each continguous object and identifying based on a single coordinate and the object size/shape.
2.  **Relative Positioning:** Define modifications relative to object properties (e.g., top-left corner, bottom-right corner, centroid) rather than absolute grid coordinates.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Introduce conditional statements to handle variations in object presence and arrangement.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Analyze each example, identify discrepancies, and adjust the natural language program and code iteratively.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of my initial observations for each example. I will add detailed reports as I develop the code_execution.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: Yellow shape, blue shape, green shape.
    *   Output: Yellow shape modified (blue and green pixels added), additional green "L" shape.
    *   Result: Mostly correct, but "L" shape insertion is incorrect. The relative positioning to existing shapes is not understood.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Yellow shape, blue shape.
    *   Output: Yellow shape modified (blue and green pixels added).
    *   Result: Yellow shape modification is closer, but still has problems - the extra "L" is not present.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Yellow shape.
    *   Output: Yellow shape modified (blue and green pixels added).
    *   Result: Similar problems to Example 2.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the largest contiguous yellow (4) object.  Also, locate any blue (1) or green (3) objects.

2.  **Modify Yellow Object:**
    *   Insert a blue (1) pixel inside the yellow object, in the second row from the bottom, maintaining the original column.
    *   Insert a green (3) pixel inside the yellow object, in the third row from the top, maintaining the original column.
    *   Add a blue (1) pixel directly above the top row of the rightmost column of the yellow shape.
    *   Add a green(3) pixel directly above the top row of the leftmost column of the yellow shape.
    *   Add a green(3) pixel directly below the bottom row of the leftmost column of the yellow shape.

3. **Conditional Shape (Based on Example 1 - needs generalization):**
    * If a separate green shape exists in the input
      * Add an "L"-shaped object consisting of green(3) and yellow(4) pixels. The "L" should be added such that the rightmost extent is based on the size of the grid, not any of the existing shapes.

The key improvement is describing actions *relative* to the yellow object's features (leftmost/rightmost column, second row from the bottom, etc.) and conditionally adding new shapes. The "L"-shape addition rule is still suspect and specific to the first example; this needs further refinement based on a more complete understanding of its appearance conditions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels
