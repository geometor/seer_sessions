Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code across all training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the derived code captured some key aspects of the transformation, particularly the "L" shaped blue object mirroring and some of the single-pixel swaps. However, it's clear that the logic for color insertion near yellow pixels (rules 3 and 4) is incomplete and incorrectly implemented. There are also missed pixel swaps and other subtle transformations not yet addressed. The approach of finding objects is good, but the specific manipulations need to be more precisely defined based on relative positions and local neighborhoods, rather than just color adjacency. The current logic is too fragile, and needs to be refined.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, carefully compare the input, expected output, and actual output. Identify specific discrepancies.
2.  **Object-Centric Refinement:** Re-evaluate the definition and properties of objects. Consider not just contiguous blocks of color, but also their shapes, relative positions, and interactions. The L shapes have already been recognized, but it may be needed to look at other geometric properties.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** The color insertion rules are conditional. The current program uses simple `if` statements, which are not sufficient. We need to be more specific about *where* these insertions occur relative to other objects and colors.
4.  **Precise Coordinate Mapping:** Instead of general rules, focus on how specific coordinates in the input map to coordinates in the output. Some transformations might be better described as coordinate translations or reflections.
5. **YAML Fact Base**: Use observation to extract important facts from the training examples provided.
6.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and the code in stages. Test after each significant change.

**Code Execution for Metrics and Reports**

To make sure that the following is correct, I will summarize the training example, describe the difference between the generated output and the expected output, and use this to update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program.

**Example 0:**

*   **Input:** A 13x15 grid with various colored pixels, including two blue "L" shapes, a horizontal line of yellow pixels, and isolated pixels of different colors.
*   **Expected Output:** Mirrored blue "L" shapes, green and red pixels inserted near the yellow line, and specific color swaps of isolated pixels.
*   **Actual Output:** The blue "L" shapes are almost mirrored, but there is a small problem with the row. Insertions near yellow are only partially correct, and some pixel swaps are correct.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** A 11x11 grid
*   **Expected Output:** specific pixel swaps and placements
*   **Actual Output:** Not all expected changes present.

**Example 2:**

*    **Input:** A 15x15 grid
*   **Expected Output:** specific transformations, including pixel mirroring and color swapping
*   **Actual Output:** not all expected changes have been realized.

**YAML Fact Base:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. Further, classify these blocks based on shape ("L", "line", "single pixel", "other"). Record all objects, their color, shape and positions.

2.  **L-Shaped Object Mirroring:**
    *   Locate "L" shaped objects of color blue. Mirror these objects across the horizontal axis.
    The position of the L shape on top, is mirrored to the bottom, and vice-versa.

3.  **Horizontal Line Transformations:**
    *   Find the horizontal line of yellow pixels, near a set of 3 green pixels. If there is a green pixel adjacent to a yellow, place an additional green pixel at the right of the line.

4. **Other Transformations:**
   - For each training example, check the objects and find if any single pixels are swapped. If true, swap them based on their position.
   - For each object that forms an L shape, determine if the pixel is mirrored or not.
   - For each object with a unique shape, determine if the pixel is mirrored or not.
   - For each pixel within a mirrored object, determine if the color of the object is changed or not.

5.  **Preservation:** Pixels not involved in the above transformations retain their original color and position.
