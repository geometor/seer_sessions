Mirror the position of the object in row 2, to become row 10. Mirror the blue object in row 10 to become row 2.\n\n3. **Color Insertion near 4,3:** There is a line of yellow(4) pixels and a set of 3 green(3) pixels in a horizontal arrangement. A green pixel appears at the right of this line of yellow pixels, only if there is yellow adjacent to green.\n\n4.  **Color Insertion near 4,2:** There is a line of yellow(4) pixels and one red(2) pixel. A red pixel is placed above the single yellow pixel adjacent to red, only if there is yellow adjacent to red.\n\n5. **Isolated single pixel color swapping**:\n    - In the input, there is a green(3) pixel at (4,9) and a yellow(4) pixel at (8,9). Swap their color, the output has the yellow pixel at (4,9), and green pixel at (8,9).\n    - In the input, there is a blue(1) pixel at (4,11) and a yellow(4) pixel at (6,10). Swap their color, the output has the yellow pixel at (4,11) and blue pixel at (6,10).\n\n6.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All other pixels retain their original colors and positions.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous objects in the grid.\"\"\"\n    objects = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(r, c, color, current_object):\n        if (r, c) in visited or r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or grid[r, c] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        current_object.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, color, current_object)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, color, current_object)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r, c] != 0:\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], current_object)\n                objects.append((grid[r,c], current_object))\n    return objects\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    objects = find_objects(input_grid)\n    \n    # Blue Object Mirroring\n    blue_objects = [obj for color, obj in objects if color == 1]\n    for color, obj in blue_objects:\n        for r, c in obj:\n            if r == 2:\n                output_grid[10-(r-2),c] = 1 # from row 2\n                output_grid[r,c] = input_grid[r,c]\n            elif r in [9,10]:\n                output_grid[2+(9-r),c] = 1\n                output_grid[r,c] = input_grid[r,c]\n    # Color Insertion near 4,3\n    \n    yellow_pixels = [(r, c) for r in range(rows) for c in range(cols) if input_grid[r, c] == 4]\n    for r, c in yellow_pixels:\n        if c + 1 < cols and input_grid[r, c + 1] == 4: # Check for horizontal yellow line\n            if c+2 < cols and input_grid[r,c+2] == 4:\n                if c+3 < cols and input_grid[r,c+3] == 4:\n                    if r+1 < rows and input_grid[r + 1, c] == 3:\n                        if  input_grid[r+1,c+1] !=3 and input_grid[r+1,c+2]!=3:\n                             output_grid[r, c+3] = 3\n\n        # Color Insertion near 4,2\n        if c+1 < cols and input_grid[r,c+1] == 2:\n            if r > 0:\n              output_grid[r - 1, c] = 2\n\n    \n    # Isolated single pixel swapping.\n    if input_grid[4,9] == 3 and input_grid[8,9] == 4:\n        output_grid[4,9] = 4\n        output_grid[8,9] = 3\n\n    if input_grid[4,11] == 1 and input_grid[6,10] == 4:\n        output_grid[4,11] = 4\n        output_grid[6,10] = 1\n\n\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
