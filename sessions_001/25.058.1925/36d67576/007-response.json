            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program and supporting data.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good starting point, capturing some key elements like object identification, L-shape mirroring, and even some specific transformations. However, it's clear that the initial approach was too specific to the first training example and didn't generalize well to the others. The handling of example-specific swaps and mirroring/color changes needs a more general, rule-based approach. The current code is more of a hardcoded instruction set rather than generalized rules.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Refine Object Properties:** Enhance the object identification to include properties like relative position (top, bottom, etc.) and adjacency to other objects. This is crucial for more general rule formulation.\n\n2.  **Generalize Mirroring:** Instead of hardcoding mirroring for specific L-shapes, derive a general rule based on object properties and relative positions. The color changes during mirroring also needs to be addressed, not by example, but as a conditional property\n\n3.  **Conditional Transformations:** Frame the transformations (mirroring, color changes, additions) as *conditional* rules. For example, \"IF an object is an L-shape AND it's blue, THEN mirror it horizontally.\"\n\n4. **Iterative Refinement using Code** Use `code_execution` to find details about the task, like size, and positions of colors, and find differences between the input and output grids.\n\n**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations:**\n\n```python\ndef code_execution(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and returns the differences between two grids.\n\n    Args:\n      input_grid: A numpy array representing the input grid.\n      output_grid: A numpy array representing the output grid.\n\n    Returns:\n      A dictionary containing:\n        -
