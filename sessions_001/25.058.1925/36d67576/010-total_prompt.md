Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (13x13).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   Most of the grid is filled with '0' (white), representing the background.
*   There are clusters of non-zero pixels forming shapes.
*   The shapes and colors in the output seem to be related to, but not identical to, those in the input. The shapes are modified and some extra elements are added.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 13x13
      cells: integers (0-9)
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: unique integer (1-9)
      pixels: set of (row, col) coordinates
      contiguous: true # Assuming shapes are contiguous blocks of color
actions:
  - type: modify_shape
    properties:
    #what needs to happen to the shape
  - type: add_shape
    properties:
    #properties of new shape
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    properties:
      adjacency: pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
      containment: shapes can be considered contained within the grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Existing Shapes:** Locate all contiguous shapes in the input grid, defined by connected pixels of the same non-zero color.

2.  **Shape Modification:**
    *   There is a yellow (4) shape stretching across multiple rows and columns. It is not significantly changed other then perhaps a slight shift.
    *   There is a blue (1) shape which appears to remain the same.
    *   There is a green (3) shape in the input and green(3) elements are added to the output.

3. **New elements:**
    * There is a blue element added in the output.
    * There are green elements added in the output

4. **Complete program**
    * Keep the main yellow shape.
    * Keep the smaller blue shape.
    * Add a single blue pixel above the far right of the main shape.
    * Add green pixels above and below the far left of the yellow shape.
    * Add a green element where there was yellow in the shape, 2 cells from the top.
    * Add a blue element in the yellow shape, one cell above the bottom.
    * Add a green shape the the right of the grid.

This natural language program describes how to transform the input grid into the output grid by preserving, modifying existing shapes, and adding some single pixels to their surroundings.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
