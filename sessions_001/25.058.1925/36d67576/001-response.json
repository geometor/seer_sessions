The input and output grids are of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve selective modification of certain colored regions based on their shape, position, and neighboring colors. Some colors seem to \"move\", while others are added or change.  There are also some lines/shapes made up of a few colors. It looks like the shapes made up of colors may be changing in some instances.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Orange areas are modified by green and blue values.\n  - observation: |\n      In example 3, a green object moves, and a blue pixel appears near other pixels.\n  - relationship:\n      There appears to be an order of importance/precedence of colors that influences the final output.\n```"

Consider these as distinct objects.\n2.  **Observe Changes:** Compare the input and output grids. Note which objects have changed in color, position, or slightly changed in shape.\n3.  **Prioritize Actions**:\n    *   If there is a single Blue(1) pixel within an orange(4) object, change that orange pixel at the location to Blue(1)\n    *   If there is a Green(3) object adjacent to an Orange(4) or Blue(1) objects, change the color of adjacent pixels to match the Orange(4) or Blue(1)\n    *   The single Red(2) pixel does not appear to move\n4.  **Apply Changes:** Iterate through the grid, applying the color and shape changes based on the rules identified above, prioritizing rules in that order.\n\n"
