Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Object Identification:** Identify all contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. Further, classify these blocks based on shape ("L", "line", "single pixel", "other"). Record all objects, their color, shape and positions.

2.  **L-Shaped Object Mirroring:**
    *   Locate "L" shaped objects of color blue. Mirror these objects across the horizontal axis.
    The position of the L shape on top, is mirrored to the bottom, and vice-versa.

3.  **Horizontal Line Transformations:**
    *   Find the horizontal line of yellow pixels, near a set of 3 green pixels. If there is a green pixel adjacent to a yellow, place an additional green pixel at the right of the line.

4. **Other Transformations:**
   - For each training example, check the objects and find if any single pixels are swapped. If true, swap them based on their position.
   - For each object that forms an L shape, determine if the pixel is mirrored or not.
   - For each object with a unique shape, determine if the pixel is mirrored or not.
   - For each pixel within a mirrored object, determine if the color of the object is changed or not.

5.  **Preservation:** Pixels not involved in the above transformations retain their original color and position.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
