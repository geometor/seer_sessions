Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 10x10 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), yellow (4), and gray (5). The output seems to be a condensed and filtered version of the input, focusing on the yellow (4) pixels, and possibly their relative positions. The gray pixel seems to disappear entirely.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: train_2
input_grid:
  dimensions: [10, 10]
  objects:
    - color: 0  # White
      shape: background
      count: many
    - color: 4  # Yellow
      shape: irregular
      count: 7
    - color: 5  # Gray
      shape: single_pixel
      count: 1
output_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 3]
  objects:
    - color: 4 #yellow
      shape: irregular
      count: 4
    - color: 0
      shape: background
      count: many

actions:
  - filter:
      - keep: [4]
      - remove: [0, 5]
  - condense:
      - method: bounding_box_or_subgrid #hypothesis, needs further testing
relationships:
    - output_contains_subset_of_input_colors: true
    - output_is_smaller_than_input: true

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** Focus on pixels with the color yellow (4).
2.  **Discard Others**: remove pixels of colors white(0) and gray(5).
3. **Create Bounding Subgrid:** Find smallest rectangular region in original input that contain all the yellow pixels
4. **Extract Subgrid:** Extract and return the minimal bounding subgrid.

Essentially, the transformation isolates the yellow pixels and extracts the smallest rectangular subgrid containing them.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
