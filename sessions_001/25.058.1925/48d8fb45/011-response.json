            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a bounding box around yellow pixels. The subsequent tests show that this approach works correctly for the first example, but the function did correctly identify that a blank output grid should be returned. This shows an error in the prompt, so we'll modify our program to address that.\n\nThe core issue is that the initial program was too specific. It assumed the goal was *always* to extract a yellow-bounded subgrid. The other example demonstrated that a null return is expected. We need to generalize the program to look for the specific situation.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** A grid with yellow, white and gray pixels.\n    *   **Expected Output:** A subgrid containing only the yellow pixels.\n    *   **Actual Output:** A subgrid containing only the yellow pixels.\n    *   **Assessment:** Correct. The bounding box logic works as intended.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** two distinct regions of yellow(4) on a background of white(0)\n    *   **Expected Output:** `[[]]`\n    *   **Actual Output:** `[[]]`\n    *   **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  example_1:\n    input:\n      objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: rectangle\n          bounding_box: [[1,1],[5,5]] #example coordinates\n        - color: white\n          shape: background\n        - color: gray\n          shape: rectangle\n    output:\n      objects:\n        - color: yellow\n          shape: rectangle\n          relation_to_input: bounding box of yellow pixels\n  example_2:\n    input:\n      objects:\n          - color: yellow\n            shape: rectangle\n            count: 2\n            is_adjacent: no\n          - color: white\n            shape: background\n\n    output:\n      objects: []\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n```\n1. Check for the presence of distinct regions of yellow(4) pixels within a\n   background of white(0).\n2. If there are multiple, non-adjacent regions of color 4, return a blank\n   output `[[]]`.\n2. Otherwise, identify yellow (4) pixels.\n3.  Discard pixels of colors white(0) or gray(5).\n4. Create a Bounding Subgrid: Find the smallest rectangular subgrid in the original input\n   that contains all the yellow pixels.\n5. Extract Subgrid: Extract and return the minimal bounding subgrid containing yellow.\n```\n"
