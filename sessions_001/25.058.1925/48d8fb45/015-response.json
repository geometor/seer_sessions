The red pixels appear in two distinct groups.\n*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing a mix of white (0) and red (2) pixels. The arrangement of red pixels seems to correspond to a specific part of the input grid. The single grey pixel seems to be missing.\n* The output grid seems to capture the structure of upper-left cluster of red\n    pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
