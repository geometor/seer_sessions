The input grids contain various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9), with white (0) being the most prevalent, acting likely as a background. The output grids seem to be a condensed representation, focusing on specific colored objects within the input, while ignoring the white background and the grey (5) pixels. It appears that a non-white, non-grey object is extracted. It seems like only one colored shape/object besides 0 and 5 is extracted. There may be more than one distinct object of the same color.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
