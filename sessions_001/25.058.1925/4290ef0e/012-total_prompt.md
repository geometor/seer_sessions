Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved identifying colored shapes and creating a 7x7 grid centered around them. While this worked for the first example, it's clear from the other examples that the transformation rule is more specific and may involve additional constraints or object selection criteria. The current implementation is too general. It isn't correctly handling all cases, particularly the second and third examples. The key will be to identify consistent patterns or rules that apply across *all* training examples, not just the first. We need to refine our object selection and placement logic.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the objects present, their colors, positions, and how they relate to the output.
2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Find the common rules or logic that consistently explain the transformation across all examples. Look for selection criteria (e.g., specific colors, shapes, relative positions).
3.  **Refine Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function might need adjustments. It currently groups contiguous pixels of the same color, which may not be sufficient.
4.  **Update Bounding Box/Centering Logic:** The current logic assumes a 7x7 output centered on a calculated bounding box. This assumption may be incorrect or incomplete. Consider if the output size is always 7x7 or if the centering logic needs adjustment.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Update the natural language program and the code incrementally, testing after each change to ensure the changes improve the overall accuracy.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To help, let's represent each example. The code provided can easily be adapted to give a comprehensive summary.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify all pixels that are not azure (color 8).
2. **Create Output Grid:** If there is one and only one non-azure color, create a 7x7 output grid filled with black (color 0) and place the single pixel of the found color in the bottom right corner.
3. **Handle Multiple Target Colors**: If there are multiple non-azure pixel colors, the program should determine their locations relative to each other, and re-create that relative positioning and color in the output grid, with black (color 0) used for empty cells. If it would overflow the 7x7 grid, then fallback to placing the pixel that is farthest down and to the right, and fill the output grid according to instruction 2.

The key improvement here is explicitly stating the conditions for single and multiple target colors, and the 7x7 grid creation based on the *single* pixel when there is one and only one color, and relative positions when there are multiple colors, using the single pixel fallback when the re-created layout wouldn't fit in the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
