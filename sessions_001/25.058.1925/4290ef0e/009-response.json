Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe input is a large grid (18x18) filled primarily with the value '8' (azure). There are distinct shapes formed by other colors:\n\n*   A blue (1) \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape in the top-left quadrant.\n*   A yellow (4) square in the bottom-left quadrant.\n*   A red (2) square in the bottom-center.\n* A single white (0) pixel is present.\n\nThe output is a smaller grid (7x7) that seems to represent a compressed and simplified version of the input. The colors in the output correspond to the colors in the input, maintaining their relative positions. The azure (8) background of input grid is gone.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore the background (azure pixels).\n\n2.  **Bounding Box:** Imagine the smallest possible rectangle that fully contains *only* the identified colored shapes/pixel, and create a bounding box surrounding these identified colored shapes.\n\n3. **Center Extraction:** Find the center of the cross and the white pixel and all shapes within the bounding box. Create 7x7 output grid centered on these colored shapes.\n\n4.  **Color Mapping:** Map the colors of the identified shapes/pixels from the original bounding box onto the corresponding position within the 7x7 output grid.\n\n5. **Output:** return the 7 x 7 grid\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies significant colored shapes, removes the azure background and creates a 7x7 bounding box, and maps the color from the input to output grid.\n"
