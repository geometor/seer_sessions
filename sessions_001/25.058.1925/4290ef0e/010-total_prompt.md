Okay, I'm ready to analyze this input-output pair and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (18x18) filled primarily with the value '8' (azure). There are distinct shapes formed by other colors:

*   A blue (1) "cross" or "plus" shape in the top-left quadrant.
*   A yellow (4) square in the bottom-left quadrant.
*   A red (2) square in the bottom-center.
* A single white (0) pixel is present.

The output is a smaller grid (7x7) that seems to represent a compressed and simplified version of the input. The colors in the output correspond to the colors in the input, maintaining their relative positions. The azure (8) background of input grid is gone.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: blue_cross
    type: shape
    color: blue (1)
    initial_position: top-left quadrant
    shape: cross/plus

  - id: yellow_square
    type: shape
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position: bottom-left quadrant
    shape: square

  - id: red_square
    type: shape
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: bottom-center
    shape: square
    
  - id: white_pixel
    type: shape
    color: white (0)
    initial_position: near center
    shape: pixel

  - id: azure_background
    type: background
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: all over the input grid
    shape: grid

  - id: output_grid
    type: grid
    color: various
    shape: 7 x 7

actions:
- type: simplify
  agent: unknown
  target: input grid
  result: output grid. removing azure

- type: reposition
  agent: unknown
  target: shapes and pixel within input grid
  result: shapes and pixel in output grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Shapes:** Locate the blue cross, yellow square, red square, and white pixel within the larger input grid. Ignore the background (azure pixels).

2.  **Bounding Box:** Imagine the smallest possible rectangle that fully contains *only* the identified colored shapes/pixel, and create a bounding box surrounding these identified colored shapes.

3. **Center Extraction:** Find the center of the cross and the white pixel and all shapes within the bounding box. Create 7x7 output grid centered on these colored shapes.

4.  **Color Mapping:** Map the colors of the identified shapes/pixels from the original bounding box onto the corresponding position within the 7x7 output grid.

5. **Output:** return the 7 x 7 grid

In essence, the transformation identifies significant colored shapes, removes the azure background and creates a 7x7 bounding box, and maps the color from the input to output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
