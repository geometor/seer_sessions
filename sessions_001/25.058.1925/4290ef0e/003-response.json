The input grid contains several colored regions: a large yellow (4) background, blue (1) squares, a green (3) cluster, and magenta (6) shapes. The output grid seems to represent a condensed, abstracted version of the input, retaining some of the color and relative spatial information, but with significant changes in shape and size. The output grid has a magenta border and includes blue, yellow and green colored areas.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
