The input grid appears to contain several distinct colored regions or \"objects.\" The output grid seems to be a simplified or abstracted representation of the input, focusing on specific features and potentially their spatial relationships. Key colors involved are:\n\n-   Green (3) appears to be the background.\n-   Blue (1), Red (2), Yellow(4), Orange (7), Azure (8), Magenta (6). These appear to be the main colors that form some kind of symbol or figure\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
