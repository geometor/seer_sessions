Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Identify Target Pixels: Examine the input grid and identify all pixels that are not azure (color 8).
2. Create Output Grid: If there is one and only one non-azure color, create a 7x7 output grid filled with black (color 0) and place the single pixel of the found color in the bottom right corner.
3. Handle Multiple Target Colors**: If there are multiple non-azure pixel colors, the program should determine their locations relative to each other, and re-create that relative positioning and color in the output grid, with black (color 0) used for empty cells. If it would overflow the 7x7 grid, then fallback to placing the pixel that is farthest down and to the right, and fill the output grid according to instruction 2.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current program works perfectly for the first example, where a single non-azure pixel, or a configuration of multiple non-azure pixels, is mapped to a 7x7 grid. However, it fails in other cases, specifically when:

1.  **Example 2**: No non-azure pixels are present. The current code produces an empty 7x7, when the expected output is a scaled up 7x7 azure colored grid.
2.  **Example 3**: Only one target color exists and the pixel is placed correctly.

The core issue is that the program doesn't handle cases where ALL input pixels are of color azure (8), or no target pixels exist. It should detect these cases, and provide a fallback to create a 7x7 output filled with azure.

**Metrics and Observations using Code Execution**

To thoroughly understand the behavior, I'll use `code_execution` to gather data on each example. Specifically, I'll check:

*   The number of target pixels found.
*   The unique colors of target pixels.
*   The dimensions of the input grid.
*   The calculated output of `transform` compared to the expected output.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Examine Input:** Examine the input grid to determine the dimensions and pixel colors.

2.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Find all pixels that are *not* azure (color 8).

3. **Output Grid Creation:**
    *   **Case 1: All Azure:** If *all* pixels in the input grid are azure, create a 7x7 output grid filled entirely with azure (color 8).
    *   **Case 2: One Non-Azure Color, One or More Pixels**: If there is one and only one color other than azure and at least one pixel of that color exists, create a 7x7 black (color 0) output grid. Place a single pixel of the non-azure color in the bottom-right corner (position (6, 6)) of the output grid.
    *  **Case 3: Multiple target colors, small area**: If there are multiple non-azure colors present, and their bounding box fits within a 7x7 grid, create a 7x7 grid and position the non-azure pixels relative to the top-left corner of the bounding box on the input grid.
     *  **Case 4: Multiple target colors, large area**: If there are multiple non-azure colors, and the dimensions (height or width) of their bounding box is greater than 7, create a 7x7 black grid. Place one pixel with the color of the pixel farthest down and to the right on the bottom-right corner (position (6,6)) of the output grid.
    *   **Case 5: No pixels found.** If no target pixels are found, create a 7x7 output grid filled entirely with black (color 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
