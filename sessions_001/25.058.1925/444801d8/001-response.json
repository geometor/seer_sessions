The colors include white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), magenta (6), and azure (8). There appear to be two primary objects in each input grid: a connected shape of blue (1) pixels and a single pixel of a different color (red, green, magenta, or azure). The output grids seem to highlight where these two types of objects would overlap if overlaid. If the single colored pixel falls inside the blue object, then the blue object in the output becomes filled with the color of the single pixel. If the blue pixels border on zeros, those zeros also get changed to be the color of the single pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Consider a pixel to be within the shape if it's part of the contiguous blue region.\n\n3.  **Fill (If Contained):** If the single pixel is within the blue shape, change all the blue pixels to the single pixel color that is inside the blue shape.\n\n4.  **Border Fill:** Where the blue shape from the original input borders the white background, change the white pixels to be the color of the single pixel color that is inside the blue shape.\n\n5. **Other Pixels:** Ensure all other pixels, including the single pixel itself from input, retain their original colors. If original color was white(0), then pixels remain white unless filled as a border.\n"
