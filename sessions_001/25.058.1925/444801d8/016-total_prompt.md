Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of the same dimensions (10x10). The input grid contains pixels of colors primarily white (0), blue (1), magenta (6), and azure (8). The output grid seems to retain some elements of the input grid (the blue (1) areas and the overall shape) but modifies the magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels based on their location and neighboring colors. There's a clear interaction: the magenta pixel seems to "expand" or "fill" the blue area above where it occurrs originally and the azure does this for the blue area below it.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: pixel_cluster
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      shape: irregular, contiguous

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: magenta (6)
      location: [2,3] # row, col

  - type: pixel
    properties:
        color: azure (8)
        location: [8,6]

actions:
  - name: expand_color
    agent: pixel_cluster (magenta or azure)
    target: adjacent pixel_cluster (blue)
    relation: replace blue pixels with the expanding color

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: magenta pixel and blue pixels above
    result: magenta expansion

  - type: adjacency
    between: azure pixel and blue pixels below
    result: azure expansion
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the single magenta (6) pixel and the single azure (8) pixel within the input grid.

2.  **Locate adjacent objects:** Identify all blue objects.

3.  **Magenta Expansion:** Replace the blue object above and connected the original magenta pixel with magenta.

4. **Azure Expansion:** Replace the blue object connected to the original azure object with azure.

5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels, including blue ones, that are not adjacent to the magenta object above it, or the azure object below it remain unchanged.

In essence, the magenta pixel's color "floods" or "fills" the blue area above it, and the azure does this below it. The original magenta and azure pixels are included in this "flooding".

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
