Identify a blue horizontal line and a red square in the input grid. Expand the blue region downwards, replacing white (0) pixels with blue (1) pixels, stopping one row above the top edge of the red square.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the derived code were based on the first training example. While it performed correctly on that specific instance, it failed on others. The core issue seems to be an over-specificity to the first example and a lack of generalization. The code correctly identifies the blue horizontal line and the red square and expands the blue downwards. However, the following problems exist and need a resolution strategy:

1.  **Incorrect Stopping Condition:** The blue expansion stops *one row above* the red square. This condition is ONLY appropriate for training example 0, but not the others. Some examples show that the expansion should stop when it hits ANY red pixel. Other examples show it fills the entire column.
2.  **Single Red Pixel Preservation**: The assumption about a single red pixel seems irrelevant.
3.  **Column Range:** Expanding only within the original blue line's columns is not a general rule. All examples show a full expansion of blue to the entire width of the grid.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Examples:** Carefully analyze *all* training examples to identify the *true* general rule for blue expansion and its stopping condition. Pay close attention to *all* red pixels, not just those in a "square."
2.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to reflect the generalized rule, removing any assumptions tied to a single example.
3.  **Modify Code:** Update the Python code to implement the revised program.
4.  **Iterative Testing:** Test the modified code on all training examples, repeating the analysis and refinement process until all examples pass.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

I will now create a snapshot of each grid to describe the observations. This will assist in building a more robust YAML description.

**Example-Specific Observations and Comparisons**

By running the above, the following becomes evident (summarized for brevity):

*   **Example 0:**
    *   `train_input_0`: Contains a blue horizontal line and a red square.
    *   `train_output_0`: The blue line has expanded downwards until one row above the red square.
    *   `transformed_0`: Matches `train_output_0`. (Success)
*   **Example 1:**
    *   `train_input_1`: Contains a blue horizontal line and a single red pixel.
    *   `train_output_1`: The blue has expanded downwards until the row of the red pixel.
    *   `transformed_1`:  Fails. Stops one row *above* the red pixel.
*    **Example 2:**
    *   `train_input_2`: Contains a blue horizontal line and a *single* red pixel, much lower.
    *   `train_output_2`: The blue line has expanded downwards to fill the entire column, stopping *at* the red pixel.
    *   `transformed_2`: Fails. Stops one row above the red.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   `train_input_3`: Contains a blue horizontal line and a *vertical* red line, much lower.
    *   `train_output_3`: The blue has expanded to the bottom.
    *   `transformed_3`: Fails. Stops one row above the red line.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify a blue horizontal line.**
2.  **Expand the blue color downwards, replacing white (0) pixels with blue (1) pixels.**
3. The expansion should fill the entire grid.
4. **Stopping Condition**: The downward expansion stops immediately upon encountering *any* red pixel. If no red pixel is encountered in a column, the expansion continues to the bottom of the grid.

This revised program accounts for the behavior observed in *all* training examples, not just the first. It removes the incorrect "one row above" and the irrelevant "single red pixel" conditions. It now correctly describes the stopping behavior as dependent on encountering a red pixel in the path of expansion and the scenario where the grid fills completely.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
