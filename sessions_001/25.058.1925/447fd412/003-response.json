The input grid contains distinct colored regions (objects).\n*   **Output Grid:** A 2D array of the same dimensions as the input, also with digits representing colors. It seems to build on the existing colors/shapes.\n*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and red (2).\n*   **Shapes:** There are two types of shapes in the input. A connected blue shape in the top, left quadrant, and two small squares made from four red pixels in the bottom part.\n* **Expansion:** It looks like the red blocks at the bottom are being used as a seed to build bigger objects.\n* **Blue:** All blue cells from input exist in output\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Connect the two blocks with blue blocks, and form a larger, single block that also includes the blue cells from the input.\n4.  **Background:** The rest of the grid remains white (0).\n\nEssentially the program connects the red blocks and expands the newly built shape to also contain the original blue block.\n"
