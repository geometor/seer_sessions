Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). There are distinct colored regions (objects) in the input grid that appear to be modified in the output grid. The most noticeable change is the expansion of the blue region downwards.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Continue the fill directly downwards.\n4.  **Stop Condition:** Stop the downward expansion one row above the top edge of the red square. The added blue region does not superimpose, overlap or replace the red region.\n5. The single red pixel at the end of the blue line is preserved.\n\nEssentially the pre-existing blue line expands downwards until one row above a larger red object.\n"
