Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 2D array of digits (0-9), representing colors. The input grid contains distinct colored regions (objects).
*   **Output Grid:** A 2D array of the same dimensions as the input, also with digits representing colors. It seems to build on the existing colors/shapes.
*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (1), and red (2).
*   **Shapes:** There are two types of shapes in the input. A connected blue shape in the top, left quadrant, and two small squares made from four red pixels in the bottom part.
* **Expansion:** It looks like the red blocks at the bottom are being used as a seed to build bigger objects.
* **Blue:** All blue cells from input exist in output

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_shape
    type: connected_region
    color: blue (1)
    location: top_left
    properties:
      - original: yes

  - name: red_squares
    type: square
    color: red (2)
    size: 2x2
    location: bottom
    properties:
     - expanded: yes

  - name: white_background
    type: background
    color: white (0)

actions:
    - name: expansion
      object: red_squares
      type: extend, connect
      details: extend to include blue shape
      
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the connected blue (1) shape in the top-left quadrant and the two 2x2 red (2) squares in the bottom half of the input grid.
2. **Copy:** All blue cells from input should remain in output.
3.  **Expand Red:** Expand the two 2x2 red blocks at the bottom. Connect the two blocks with blue blocks, and form a larger, single block that also includes the blue cells from the input.
4.  **Background:** The rest of the grid remains white (0).

Essentially the program connects the red blocks and expands the newly built shape to also contain the original blue block.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
