The transformation appears to involve identifying specific colored shapes (objects) in the input and potentially replicating or modifying them in the output, sometimes changing some colors. The key colors seem to be blue (1) and red (2). White (0) appears to be background.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
