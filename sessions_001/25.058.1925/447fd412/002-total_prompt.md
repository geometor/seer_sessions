<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2384x1842 at 0x78E5F21D3350>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single-digit integer representing a color. The transformation appears to involve identifying specific colored shapes (objects) in the input and potentially replicating or modifying them in the output, sometimes changing some colors. The key colors seem to be blue (1) and red (2). White (0) appears to be background.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object_types:
    - name: blue_shape
      description: Contiguous block of blue (1) pixels.
      properties:
        - color: blue (1)
    - name: red_shape
      description: Contiguous block of red (2) pixels.
      properties:
        - color: red (2)
  - actions:
    - name: replicate
      description: Create a copy of an object.
    - name: extend
      description: add blue to red
    - name: color_change
      description: some red are changed to blue in the output
  - relationships:
    - spatial: Objects are positioned relative to each other within the grid.
    - adjacency: The direct connection of objects is a factor.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blue (1) and red (2) shapes in the input grid.
2.  **Red Shape Extension**: extend the red shape by converting all the white pixels that share and edge to a red pixel into a 1 (blue) pixel.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
