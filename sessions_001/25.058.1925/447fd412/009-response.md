Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A grid of pixels, mostly black (0), with some blue (1) and red (2) pixels.  The blue pixels form a cross-like shape.  There are individual red pixels scattered around.
*   **Output:**  The grid is the same size as the input. The blue cross in the top center area remains. New blue (1) pixels, are placed in a symmetrical pattern that mimics original red pixels (2), but where it is blue (1), and it mirrors the red (2) position, by reflecting the red (2) pixels at the same position relative to the blue(1) cross.
* **Transformation:** The core blue cross stays the same. The red pixels are "mirrored" or "reflected" across the center *blue cross* creating a set of "mirror" blue pixels.

**YAML Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color:
          - white: 0
          - blue: 1
          - red: 2
  - object: blue_cross
    properties:
      - shape: cross-like
      - location: top-center
      - role: axis of symmetry
  - object: red_pixel
    properties:
      - role: source for reflection
  - action: reflection
    description: Red pixels are mirrored across the center of the blue cross, changing the color of the target pixels.
    parameters:
       source_color: 2 #red
       target_color: 1 #blue
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the blue cross shape at the top center of the input grid. This will serve as our axis of symmetry.
2.  **Locate** all red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.
3.  **For each** red pixel:
    *   **Calculate** its mirrored position relative to the *center of the blue cross*. The mirrored position has the same row/column offsets from the cross's center, but on the opposite sides.
    * **IF** mirrored location within grid
        * **Change** the pixel at mirrored position. If the pixel value is white (0) change to blue(1).

In essence, the transformation preserves the central blue cross and reflects the red pixels across it, turning the mirrored pixels into blue pixels.
