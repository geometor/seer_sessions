Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies a central blue cross shape within the grid. The center of this cross serves as the reflection axis.
There are no red pixels, therefore no mirroring, so the output is the same as the input.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_blue_cross_center(grid):
    # Find all blue pixels
    blue_pixels = np.argwhere(grid == 1)
    if blue_pixels.size == 0:
        return None

    # Calculate the center of the blue pixels
    center_row = int(np.mean(blue_pixels[:, 0]))
    center_col = int(np.mean(blue_pixels[:, 1]))
    return (center_row, center_col)

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Find the center of the blue cross
    cross_center = find_blue_cross_center(input_grid)
    if cross_center is None:
        return output_grid  # Return original if no blue cross

    # Since there are no red pixels to mirror, return the input grid as the output.
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
