**input:**

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 2x2 grid. The output is a 4x4 grid. The colors in the input grid (blue, red, green, and azure) are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 8, respectively.  The output grid expands each input pixel into a 2x2 block of the same color. The output also includes a white (0) border around and within the expanded input pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 2x2 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 4x4 grid.
  - property: Input grid cells have colors corresponding to values 1, 2, 3, and 8.
  - property: Output grid cells have colors corresponding to values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8.
  - relationship: Each input cell maps to a 2x2 block of the same color in the output.
  - relationship: Output contains a white (0) border, one pixel wide, surrounding the expanded cells and also within the output structure.
  - action: Input grid is expanded.
  - action: Border is added.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Expand Each Pixel:** For each pixel in the input grid, create a 2x2 block of pixels in the output grid, all having the same color as the original input pixel.

2.  **Add White Border:** Add a one-pixel wide border of white (0) around the entire output grid.

3.  **Add White Interior Border:** Add a one-pixel wide interior border to separate the expanded 2x2 blocks.

Essentially the program takes each input pixel and converts it to a quadrant, separated by zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
