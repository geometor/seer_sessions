**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (input) into a larger grid (output). The input grids seem to contain single-digit integers, each representing a distinct color. The output grids appear to be an expanded version of the input, with some added padding of '0' (white) pixels. The core transformation seems to involve duplicating the input pixels both horizontally and vertically, and then surrounding this expanded grid with a border of '0' pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 2x2, 2x3, 3x3)
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: derived from input_grid (input_rows + 2) x (input_cols + 2)
      - values: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors, including '0' for padding

actions:
  - name: duplicate_pixels
    description: Each pixel in the input_grid is duplicated horizontally and vertically.
  - name: add_padding
    description: A border of '0' (white) pixels is added around the duplicated grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid: output_grid is derived from input_grid
  - pixel_duplication: input_grid pixels are expanded 2x2 in output_grid
  - padding: output_grid has a '0' border of one pixel width
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Get Dimensions:** Determine the number of rows and columns in the *input_grid*.
2.  **Duplicate Pixels:** Create a new grid that is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions (2\*rows x 2\*columns).  For each pixel in the *input\_grid*, replicate its value into a 2x2 block in the new, larger grid. For example, if a pixel in the input grid has value '3' at position (0,0), then in new, larger grid assign value '3' at locations (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).
3.  **Add Padding:** Create the final *output\_grid* by adding a one-pixel border of '0' (white) around the duplicated grid. This means the *output_grid* dimensions will be (2\*rows + 2) x (2\*columns + 2). Fill locations on row 0 and row (2\*rows+1) with zero. Fill locations on column 0 and (2\*cols + 1) with zero.

Essentially input grid values are expanded to 2x2 and the result is padded
with a single row/column of 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
