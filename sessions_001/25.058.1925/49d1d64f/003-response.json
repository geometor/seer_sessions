The colors in the input grid (blue, red, green, and azure) are represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 8, respectively.  The output grid expands each input pixel into a 2x2 block of the same color. The output also includes a white (0) border around and within the expanded input pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
