Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was a good first attempt, expanding the input grid by adding borders. However, it incorrectly adds two rows and four columns of zeros and has logic errors, especially in the expansion of output grid with replicated rows and columns. The provided test results reveal discrepancies in how the borders are handled, particularly in replicating the edge rows and columns. The core issue is that the code does not accurately reflect a consistent rule applicable to all examples.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Correct the Border Expansion Logic:** Focus on accurately replicating the edge rows and columns *once*, to all examples, rather then adding padding of zeros.
2.  **Verify Against All Examples:** Use the `code_execution` function to rigorously test against *all* provided examples, not just the first.
3.    **Focus on the Core Pattern**: Pay very close attention to exactly what is the position change of all the values in the grid - where the original end up in the new grid.
4. **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on a consistent, working rule.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including the results from the `code_execution` function (as provided in the prompt, as the code is not interactive here):

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: (2, 2)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (6, 6)
    *   Match: `False`
    *   Notes: initial attempt was for this example. The padding approach is wrong, but the general dimensions are not.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: (2, 3)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (4, 5)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (4, 7)
    *   Match: `False`
    *   Notes: columns are incorrect.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: (3, 2)
    *   Expected Output Shape: (5, 4)
    *   Actual Output Shape: (5, 6)
    *   Match: `False`
        *   Notes: columns are incorrect.

        agent: system
        source: input_grid
        target: output_grid
        location: center (row+1, col+1 of output_grid)

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Copy the Input:** The original input grid is copied directly into the output grid, but offset by one row and one column in each dimension. This places the input grid in the "center" of the output grid.

2. **Expand Rows:** The top row of the *input* grid becomes the top row of the expanded *output* grid. The bottom row of the *input* grid is also replicated to be bottom row of the *output* grid.

3.  **Expand Columns:** The leftmost column of the *input* grid is replicated to be the leftmost column of the *output* grid. The rightmost column of the *input* grid is replicated to be the rightmost column of the output grid.

In short, the transformation creates a border around the original grid by duplicating the edge rows and columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
