The input grids seem to contain single-digit integers, each representing a distinct color. The output grids appear to be an expanded version of the input, with some added padding of '0' (white) pixels. The core transformation seems to involve duplicating the input pixels both horizontally and vertically, and then surrounding this expanded grid with a border of '0' pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For each pixel in the *input\\_grid*, replicate its value into a 2x2 block in the new, larger grid. For example, if a pixel in the input grid has value '3' at position (0,0), then in new, larger grid assign value '3' at locations (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n3.  **Add Padding:** Create the final *output\\_grid* by adding a one-pixel border of '0' (white) around the duplicated grid. This means the *output_grid* dimensions will be (2\\*rows + 2) x (2\\*columns + 2). Fill locations on row 0 and row (2\\*rows+1) with zero. Fill locations on column 0 and (2\\*cols + 1) with zero.\n\nEssentially input grid values are expanded to 2x2 and the result is padded\nwith a single row/column of 0.\n"
