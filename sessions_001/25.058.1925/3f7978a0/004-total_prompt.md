Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a larger grid (input) to a smaller grid (output). The grids contain numerical values that represent colors. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), azure (8), and gray (5). The output grid appears to be a condensed or extracted version of the input grid, retaining only certain colored pixels and eliminating others, primarily the white (0) background. The spatial arrangement of the retained pixels seems to be preserved in a compressed form.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 9x9
      - values: [0, 5, 8]
      - description: Contains a pattern of azure (8) and gray (5) pixels on a white (0) background.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 5x5
      - values: [0, 5, 8]
      - description: Contains a condensed pattern of azure (8) and gray (5) pixels, with some white (0) pixels.

actions:
  - name: extract_pattern
    description: Selects specific colored pixels (5 and 8) from the input grid and arranges them in a smaller grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: spatial_compression
    description: The output grid maintains the relative spatial arrangement of the selected pixels from the input grid, but in a compressed form.  Rows and columns of only 0 are removed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Examine the input grid and identify pixels with values of 5 (gray) and 8 (azure).
2.  **Remove Empty Rows and Columns:** Eliminate any rows and columns in the input grid that *only* contain 0 (white) pixels.
3. **Compress:** Create the output grid by taking whatever remains and compressing to eliminate white space.
4.  **Construct Output:** Form the output grid by arranging the identified target pixels (5 and 8) in a new grid, preserving their relative positions from the input grid. The resulting grid will be smaller due to the removal of all-white rows and columns.

In essence, the transformation extracts a sub-grid containing only the non-zero pixels, removing the surrounding "whitespace" (pixels with value 0) while preserving the core pattern of the colored pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
