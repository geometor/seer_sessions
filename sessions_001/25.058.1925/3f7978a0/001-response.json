The output grids are consistently smaller than the input grids and contain only the colors corresponding to 5 and 8, with 0s filling the rest. The shape of the output seems to depend on the positioning of 5's and 8's in the input grid. It seems as though certain parts of input grids are being extracted.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This subgrid will contain all rows and columns between (and including) the boundary rows and columns.\n4. The size of output grid's width equals the index of the right most non-zero column minus the index of left most non-zero column plus 1, The size of output grid's height equals the index of the bottom most non-zero row minus the index of the top most non-zero row plus 1.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation identifies the smallest rectangle within the input grid that completely encloses all non-zero pixels, and extracts it to produce the output grid.\n"
