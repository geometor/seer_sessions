The colors present are white (0), azure (8), and grey (5). The output is a smaller grid containing only the azure and grey pixels, arranged in a specific way, surrounded by white pixels. The output seems to extract and condense the non-white pixels from the input, while maintaining a general spatial pattern related to the positions of the colors in a mirrored structure. The transformation involves a significant reduction in size, discarding the majority of the white pixels and focusing exclusively on the colored regions, and mirroring some object.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
