Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule extracts a sub-grid containing only the non-zero pixels,
removing the surrounding "whitespace" (pixels with value 0) while preserving
the core pattern of the colored pixels.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert input_grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Find rows and columns that are not all zeros
    non_zero_rows = np.any(input_array != 0, axis=1)
    non_zero_cols = np.any(input_array != 0, axis=0)

    # Extract the sub-grid based on non-zero rows and columns
    output_array = input_array[non_zero_rows][:, non_zero_cols]

    return output_array.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
