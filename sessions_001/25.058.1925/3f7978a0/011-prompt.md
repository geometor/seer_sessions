```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize contiguous blocks of azure (8) and gray (5) pixels as distinct objects within the input grid.
2.  **Selection Rule:** Select specific azure and gray objects based on an unknown criterion. All white (0) pixels are discarded.
3. **Create subgrid:** Select only the rows and colums that contain the azure and gray objects.
4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid (5x7) using the subgrid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
