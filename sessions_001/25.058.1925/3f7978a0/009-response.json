There are no new colors introduced.\n* **Object Selection:** It seems like certain azure (8) and Grey (5) objects are selcted, and the other pixels are discarded.\n*   **Relative Positioning:** The selected azure and grey objects in the output appear to maintain some of their relative positioning from the input, though condensed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All white (0) pixels are discarded.\n3. **Create subgrid:** Select only the rows and colums that contain the azure and gray objects.\n4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid (5x7) using the subgrid.\n\nThe core challenge, and unknown in this transformation, is the specific selection rule used to determine WHICH of the azure and grey objects are included in the output.
