## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x749915C6C4C0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x749915C6D9F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors.  The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation or reflection, as the relative positions of the numbers change, but all the original numbers are still present in the output. The core challenge is to determine the precise geometric transformation being applied.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    element_type: color_codes
  - observation: all input elements are present in the output
  - transformation_type: geometric
  - possible_transformations:
    - rotation
    - reflection
  - specific_observation:
    - input_center: 7 (orange)
    - output_center: 7 (orange)
    - input_corner_top_right: 8 (azure)
    - output_corner_bottom_left: 8 (azure)
    - input_corner_bottom_left: 5 (gray)
    - output_corner_top_right: 5 (gray)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation is a 180-degree rotation of the grid around its center point.  Each cell's value is moved to the position diametrically opposite the center. The central value is unchanged with this transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
