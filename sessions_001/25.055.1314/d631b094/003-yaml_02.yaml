observations:
  - task: "Reconstruct objects in a single row"
  - objects: "Contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color"
  - object_properties:
      - color: "Determined by the pixel value (0-9)"
      - shape: "The dimensions and arrangement of the contiguous block"
      - position: "Original position in the input grid"
  - actions:
      - identify: "Locate all objects in the input grid"
      - extract: "Copy each object's pixels"
      - arrange: "Place the extracted objects in a single row in the output grid"
  - input_grid:
      - height: "Variable"
      - width: "Variable"
  - output_grid:
      - height: "Always 1"
      - width: "Sum of the widths of extracted objects, potentially with spacing or order changes (needs further investigation)"
  - confirmed_rule: "Output is always a single row."
  - potential_rules:
    - object_order: "Objects might be arranged in the output row based on their original row-major order, color, or size (needs confirmation)."
    - spacing: "There might be specific spacing rules between objects in the output row (needs confirmation)."
