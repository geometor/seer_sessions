1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-black (non-0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Order Objects:**  Order all of the identified objects. The order is from left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.
3. **Extract Colors:** Get the color of each object.
4.  **Construct Output:** Create a single horizontal row (1 pixel high).  For each identified object, place pixels of that object's color into the output row. Maintain the discovered order, and use the count of pixels of each color.
