The input grid has a variety of colors, while the output grid is entirely filled with a single color (magenta, represented by the value 6). The key seems to be identifying a specific color within the input grid and using it to flood the entire output grid.  The crucial element is to determine *which* color from the input is selected for the output. It is present in the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
