## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x749915C6D9F0>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x749915C6DB40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid has a variety of colors, while the output grid consists entirely of a single color. The most prominent color in the input appears to be yellow (4), which is also the color of the entire output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input and output are grids of same dimensions
    dimensions: 3x3
  - type: pixels
    description: each cell in the grid is a pixel with a color value
    values: 0-9 (integers representing colors)
  - type: transformation
    description: all pixels in the output grid have the same color
  - type: observation
    description: the output grid's color matches the most frequent color in the input grid in the top left 2x2
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the most frequent color:** Examine the input grid, specifically the 2x2 subgrid on the top-left corner.. Determine the color that appears most frequently within this area.
2.  **Create output grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3.  **Fill with dominant color:** Fill every pixel of the output grid with the color identified in step 1.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
