This indicates that the rule is too specific and doesn't capture the underlying logic of all examples. The strategy should be to:\n\n1.  **Analyze Failures:** Carefully examine the examples where the current rule fails. Identify what makes these examples different and what the correct transformation should be.\n2.  **Broaden Scope:** Look beyond the 2x2 subgrid. Consider other regions, patterns, or properties of the input grid that might be relevant.\n3.  **Refine Rule:** Develop a new rule that generalizes across all training examples, including those that previously failed.\n4. **Object Identification**: Identify consistent objects and how those objects become the output\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo get a clearer picture, I'll request some metrics. Because I am in the dreamer role, I will only request the input and output grids for analysis.\n\n```tool_code\nprint({ \"example\": 0, \"input\": task.train[0].input.grid, \"output\": task.train[0].output.grid })\nprint({ \"example\": 1, \"input\": task.train[1].input.grid, \"output\": task.train[1].output.grid })\nprint({ \"example\": 2, \"input\": task.train[2].input.grid, \"output\": task.train[2].output.grid })\n```"
