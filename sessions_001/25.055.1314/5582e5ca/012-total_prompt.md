```python
"""

If the number 9 exists in the input grid, the output grid is filled entirely with 9s.
If there is only one color other than white(0) in the input grid, fill the output with the one color.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were too simplistic. While they correctly handled the first training example, they failed on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the initial program only considered two specific conditions: the presence of the number 9, and the existence of only one non-zero color. The other examples demonstrate more complex rules are in play. We need to shift from looking for specific values to identifying more general patterns and relationships within the grids. The task likely involves identifying a specific, repeating pattern or object within the input, and then replicating/extending that pattern in the output.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will meticulously examine each input-output pair, looking for common elements, spatial relationships, and transformations.
2.  **Object Identification:** I will focus on identifying potential "objects" within the grids. An object could be a single pixel, a group of pixels of the same color, or even a specific arrangement of different colors.
3.  **Pattern Recognition:** I will look for repeated patterns, symmetries, or other regularities in the input grids that are then reflected or altered in the output grids.
4.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the observations, I'll iteratively refine the natural language program to describe the transformation in more detail.
5. I will use `code_execution` to generate a report on unique colors per example.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
