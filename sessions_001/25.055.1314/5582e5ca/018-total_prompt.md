"""
1.  **Examine the input grid.** Identify all distinct objects (contiguous regions of the same color).

2.  **Analyze each training example** based on the input, derive an understanding of how the input is related to the output. Note that the input/output transformation may vary across the examples provided in the set.

3.  **If the input contains gray pixels**: Flood fill the *entire* output grid with gray.

4.  **Otherwise, If the example has a magenta colored region in the output:** Create a 3x3 magenta rectangle at the top-left corner of the output grid, while leaving other areas unchanged.

5. **Otherwise:** Flood fill the output grid with magenta.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and formulate a plan to refine the natural language program and the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code were based on a limited understanding derived primarily from the first training example, with weak generalization checks for some of the other examples. The code correctly handles the first example, but makes incorrect assumptions about the other examples as indicated by failing more examples than it succeeded.

The strategy to improve the solution involves the following steps:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair in the training set. Pay close attention to the presence, absence, and arrangement of colors, especially gray and magenta.

2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use code execution to confirm object properties.
    *   Identify all distinct objects (contiguous regions of the same color) in both input and output grids.
    *   Determine the presence of specific colors (gray, magenta) in each input and output.
    *   Check if output is a flood fill of a single color.
    *   Measure the dimensions of output

3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis and metrics, refine the conditions and actions in the natural language program. The existing program makes several assumptions. We need to check the validity of these assumptions using code execution and revise them.

4.  **Iterative Improvement:** Update the code based on the refined natural language program. Test the updated code against all training examples and repeat the analysis and refinement process if necessary.

**Metrics Gathering (Code Execution)**

I'll use code execution to gather information about the training examples, and report relevant information.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
