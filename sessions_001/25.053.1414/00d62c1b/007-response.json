The transformation seems to involve a single, localized change: a single green (3) pixel within a cluster of green pixels changes to yellow (4).  The position chosen for the color change appears to be related to adjacency - the pixel above and to the right of a cluster of three green pixels in an L-shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
