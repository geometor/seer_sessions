"""
1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Target Pixels:** A green pixel is a target pixel if it meets *all* of the following conditions:
    *   It has a green neighbor directly below it (south).
    *   It has a green neighbor directly to its left (west).
    *   It has a green neighbor diagonally down and to its left (southwest).
3.  **Transform Target Pixels:** Change the color of all identified target pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).
4.  **Output:** The output grid is the same dimensions as the input, and all non-target pixels remain their original color.
5. **Note:** The current adjacency rule does not correctly find target pixels. The rule needs to examine all of the target pixels from the given examples to find the correct rule, and express the new rule. The new rule is a necessary condition of finding the correct transformed grid.
