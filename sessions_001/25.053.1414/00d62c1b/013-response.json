The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific color (in this case, green represented by '3') and potentially changing the color of adjacent pixels to yellow ('4'). The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant. The core concept seems related to identifying a shape/object made up of the green color and then performing some operation on areas adjacent to the green object, similar to an 'inside' or 'fill' function in image editing software, but constrained to only the immediate neighbors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Consider these pixels as forming a single, potentially irregular, shape.\n\n2.  **Find Adjacent Pixels:** For each pixel that is part of the identified shape, determine its immediate neighbors. Neighbors are defined as pixels directly above, below, to the left, or to the right (not diagonal).\n\n3.  **Conditional Color Change:**\n    *   Check the neighbors of the shape identified in step one.\n    *   If a neighboring pixel does *not* have the value '3' (green), and it exists within grid bounds, is now part of the identified shape.\n    *   Change any pixels that have become part of the shape to color value '4' (yellow).\n\n4.  **Output:** Produce the modified grid, where the identified shape's interior adjacent pixels have been changed to yellow, while all other pixels retain their original color.\n"
