            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program and supporting information.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simple premise: change the color of non-green pixels adjacent to green pixels to yellow. However, the test results across multiple examples reveal a critical flaw: the \"chain reaction\" effect.  The code modifies pixels to yellow, and *then* those newly-yellow pixels also trigger changes in *their* neighbors. This cascading effect leads to an over-application of the yellow color, significantly deviating from the expected outputs.\n\nThe core strategy to fix this is to prevent the \"chain reaction\". We need to ensure that only the *original* input grid is used to determine which pixels should change. We can implement this using different approaches such as creating a copy, using an auxiliary data structure like a set to store the coordinates to turn yellow, or creating a set of coordinates of added yellows in each iteration of the green pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per example)**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including specific observations and metrics gathered using my prior knowledge and analysis of the images provided:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** The transformed output has extra yellow pixels. The yellow spreads outwards from the green, two cells horizontally and vertically, rather than just one.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 10\n        *   size/color palette are correct.\n        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:** Similar to Example 1, the yellow color propagates excessively.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 25\n        * size/color palette are correct.\n        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Observation:**  Yellow extends beyond the immediate neighbors of the green pixels.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 29\n        * size/color palette are correct.\n        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Observation:**  Excessive yellow propagation, especially noticeable around clusters of green pixels.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 34\n        * size/color palette are correct.\n        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   **Observation:** This largest example demonstrates the flaw most dramatically.  Large areas are incorrectly turned yellow.\n    *   **Metrics:**\n        *   `pixels_off`: 101\n        * size/color palette are correct.\n        * counts of the number of pixels per color are incorrect.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task_id: '004'\n  - object_types:\n    - pixel:\n        properties:\n          color: [0, 3, 4] # white, green, yellow\n          position: [row, col]\n        actions:\n          change_color:\n            condition: \"adjacent to green pixel in the original input grid\"\n            from: \"[any color other than green]\"\n            to: \"yellow\"\n  - transformation_rules:\n      - \"Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.\"\n      - \"Identify green pixels (color value 3).\"\n      - \"For each green pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right).\"\n      - \"If a neighbor's original color is not green, change it to yellow (color value 4) in the output grid\"\n      - \"Green pixels retain original value.\"\n      - \"Pixels not adjacent to a green pixel in original grid are unchanged\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Copy Input:** Create a copy of the input grid. This copy will serve as the reference for the original state.\n2.  **Find Green Pixels:** In the *original* grid (the copy), locate all pixels with a color value of '3' (green).\n3.  **Iterate:** For *each* green pixel found in the original grid:\n    *   **Check Neighbors:** Examine its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right - not diagonal) *in the original grid*.\n    *   **Conditional Change:** For *each* neighboring pixel in the original input grid:\n        *   If the neighboring pixel's color *in the original grid* is *not* '3' (green), change the corresponding pixel's color in the *output* grid to '4' (yellow).\n4.  **Preserve Greens:** The green pixels that initiated the checks should remain green in the output grid.\n5.  **Output:** The final output is the modified grid, where only non-green pixels directly adjacent to green pixels in the *original* input grid have been changed to yellow. All other pixels should retain their original colors from the input.\n"
