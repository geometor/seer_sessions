"""
1.  **Identify Green Clusters:** Locate all contiguous blocks (clusters) of green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Target Pixels within Clusters:**
    *   For each green pixel within a cluster, examine its neighbors.
    *   If a green pixel has green neighbors directly below (south), to its left (west) and diagonal down and to its left (southwest), it is a target pixel.
3.  **Transform Target Pixels:** Change the color of all identified target pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).
4.  The output grid is the same size as the input grid and all non-target pixels are the same as in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
