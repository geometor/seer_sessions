Here's an analysis of the results and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies green clusters and attempts to find "target" pixels within them based on a specific adjacency rule (south, west, southwest neighbors). However, the results clearly show that this rule is too restrictive and doesn't capture the full pattern. The code misses several target pixels in most examples, and in Example 5, it misses a significant number. The core issue is that the adjacency rule needs to be refined, possibly expanded. The transformation logic needs to precisely define which green pixels should be turned yellow based on their surrounding, but the current rule is an underfit.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Incorrect Examples:** Carefully re-examine all examples, paying close attention to *why* the current rule failed. Focus on the pixels that *should* have been transformed but weren't, and those that *shouldn't* have but were, and identify the correct neighboring pixel conditions.
2.  **Refine the Adjacency Rule:** Based on the analysis, formulate a more comprehensive and accurate rule for identifying target pixels. Consider all eight neighbors (including diagonals) and their colors. It is very likely there is a pattern to the correct neighbors, the incorrect ones are too sparse.
3.  **Update the Natural Language Program:** Clearly articulate the revised rule in the natural language program.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** After updating the code (in the next phase), we'll re-test on all examples. If there are still errors, we'll repeat this analysis and refinement process.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of observations for each example, noting specific failures of the existing rule:

*   **Example 1:** The rule fails because it *only* looks for green neighbors. The correct transformation shows yellow pixels appearing when there's a green pixel below, and left. But also, there must be a green in southwest. In general, this example shows an L pattern, but it is not triggering.
*   **Example 2:** Similar to example 1. An additional yellow is expected below three horizontal greens. The current rule only check neighbors on S, W, SW.
*   **Example 3:** Many pixels are not transformed where expected.
*   **Example 4:** Missed many yellow pixels on interior.
*   **Example 5:** Missed almost all yellow pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

      - The transformation involves changing green (3) pixels to yellow (4).
      - The transformation depends on the neighbors of the green pixels.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Locate all green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Target Pixels:** A green pixel is a target pixel if it meets *all* of the following conditions:
    *   It has a green neighbor directly below it (south).
    *   It has a green neighbor directly to its left (west).
    *   It has a green neighbor diagonally down and to its left (southwest).
3.  **Transform Target Pixels:** Change the color of all identified target pixels from green (3) to yellow (4).
4.  **Output:** The output grid is the same dimensions as the input, and all non-target pixels remain their original color.
5. **Note:** The current adjacency rule does not correctly find target pixels. The rule needs to examine all of the target pixels from the given examples to find the correct rule, and express the new rule. The new rule is a necessary condition of finding the correct transformed grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
