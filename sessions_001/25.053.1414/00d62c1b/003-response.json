            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the results, and a plan to improve the natural language program and the code.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code are on the right track, implementing the core concept of changing pixels adjacent to green ('3') pixels to yellow ('4'). However, the results show a consistent and significant mismatch between the transformed outputs and the expected outputs. The code is *over-applying* the transformation, changing more pixels to yellow than it should. Specifically, it's changing pixels to yellow *even if they are adjacent to other yellow pixels that were created as a result of the green pixel*. It's essentially a cascading effect, whereas the correct behavior is a single \"layer\" of yellow around the greens.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue is that the code doesn't distinguish between the originally yellow pixels, the newly added yellow pixels, and other color pixels. This is a very important distinction.\n\nThe approach to correct the function is to store the newly added yellow cells as coordinates in an array. Then as we iterate over the green cells, if the current coordinates are in the stored array, then this pixel was added to the output grid (and was not original), and should not be considered when making changes to neighbor cells.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (per Example):**\n\nHere I analyze the specific errors in each training example.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Observation:** The code propagates the yellow color outwards from the green. It creates a \"cross\" shape of yellow around each green pixel, rather than just filling the directly adjacent non-green cells.\n    *    pixels_off: 10\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Observation:**  Similar to Example 1, the yellow spreads too much. The connected green pixels create a large \"blob\" of yellow, encompassing far more than just the immediate neighbors.\n    *   pixels_off: 25\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Observation:**  The effect is even more pronounced here due to the larger grid and more interconnected green pixels.  The yellow almost completely overwhelms some sections.\n    *    pixels_off: 29\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   **Observation:** The spreading of yellow is quite evident, especially where there are lines or clusters of green pixels.\n    *    pixels_off: 34\n\n*    **Example 5:**\n    *    **Observation:** a much larger grid, lots of green connected cells, and\n         an extensive propagation of yellow\n    *    pixels_off: 101\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 00d62c1b\nsummary: |\n    The task involves changing the color of pixels adjacent to green pixels.\n    Only pixels directly adjacent (up, down, left, right, not diagonal) to\n    green pixels should be changed.  The change is to yellow, and\n    only if the adjacent pixel *wasn't* green originally. Green pixels remain unchanged.\nobjects:\n  - id: grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Represents the input and output images.\n  - id: pixel\n    type: cell\n    properties:\n      color:\n        type: integer\n        values: [0-9]  # Represents colors\n        description: The color of the pixel.\n      position:\n        type: coordinate\n        description: Row and column index within the grid.\n  - id: green_pixel\n    type: pixel\n    properties:\n      color:\n        value: 3  # Green\n    description:  Pixels that trigger the color change in their neighbors.\n  - id: adjacent_pixel\n    type: pixel\n    description: A pixel directly above, below, left, or right of another pixel.\nactions:\n  - name: change_color\n    actor: adjacent_pixel\n    condition: |\n      Is adjacent to a green_pixel AND is not a green_pixel.\n    result:\n      color: 4  # Yellow\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Find Green Pixels:** Locate all pixels within the input grid that have a color value of '3' (green).\n\n2.  **Iterate:** For *each* green pixel found:\n\n    *   **Check Neighbors:** Examine its four immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right - not diagonal).\n\n    *   **Conditional Change:** For *each* neighboring pixel:\n        *   If the neighboring pixel's *original* color is *not* '3' (green), change its color to '4' (yellow).\n\n3. **Preserve Greens**: The green pixels that initiated the checks should remain green.\n4.  **Output:** The final output is the grid with the described modifications. All pixels not directly adjacent to a green pixel should retain their original colors. A neighbor that has been changed to yellow, should not change its neighbors.\n"
