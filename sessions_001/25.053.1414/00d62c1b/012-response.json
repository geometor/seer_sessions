The rule needs to examine all of the target pixels from the given examples to find the correct rule, and express the new rule. The new rule is a necessary condition of finding the correct transformed grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_valid(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"Helper function: Checks if a given row and column are within the grid bounds.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the colors of all eight neighbors of a pixel, handling boundaries using mirroring.\n    Returns a dictionary with keys for each direction (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = {}\n    \n    # Define neighbor offsets with mirroring for out-of-bounds access\n    offsets = {\n        'N': (-1, 0),\n        'NE': (-1, 1),\n        'E': (0, 1),\n        'SE': (1, 1),\n        'S': (1, 0),\n        'SW': (1, -1),\n        'W': (0, -1),\n        'NW': (-1, -1)\n    }\n\n    for direction, (dr, dc) in offsets.items():\n      nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            \n      #mirror out of bounds\n      if nr < 0:\n        nr = 0\n      if nr >= rows:\n        nr = rows -1\n      if nc < 0:\n        nc = 0\n      if nc >= cols:\n        nc = cols -1\n\n      neighbors[direction] = grid[nr, nc]\n    return neighbors\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the specified rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Iterate through all pixels\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # Process only green pixels\n            if input_grid[r, c] == 3:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n                # Check the refined adjacency rule (THIS IS STILL THE INADEQUATE RULE)\n                if (neighbors['S'] == 3 and\n                    neighbors['W'] == 3 and\n                    neighbors['SW'] == 3):\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
