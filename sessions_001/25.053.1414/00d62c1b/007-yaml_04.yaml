objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - width: 10
      - height: 10
      - color_values: [0, 3, 4]

  - name: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      - color:
          type: integer
          values: [0, 3, 4]  # white, green, yellow
      - position:
          type: coordinate (row, column)

  - name: green_cluster
    type: object
    definition: contiguous block of green (3) pixels
    properties:
       - shape: [ L-shape ]

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    target: single green pixel
    precondition: pixel is part of a green cluster
    postcondition: pixel color changes to yellow (4)
    constraints:
      - location : pixel is chosen based on green cluster shape and appears to follow a consistent rule.  Specifically, the green pixel that has a green pixel diagonally down and to the left, and a green pixel below it is changed.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side or a corner.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains pixels.
  - type: part_of
    description: A green pixel can be part of a green cluster.
