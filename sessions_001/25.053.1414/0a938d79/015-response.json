            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of horizontal expansion and vertical repetition was partially correct but failed to capture the core logic of alternating rows and combining information from multiple non-white pixels correctly. The code also seems to have trouble with the concept of interleaving different colors based on original position, and instead only shows one of the non-white pixel colors. The results consistently fail because the combination or mixing of multiple colored rows is not happening as described in the expected output, especially in example 1.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Correct Alternation:** The current alternation logic is flawed. It only considers a mod 2 relationship to the orignal row, but we must instead maintain the original row of each colored pixel, and copy to the other locations.\n2.  **Multiple Non-White Pixels:** Handle multiple non-white pixels correctly by applying the fill, and making use of all the non-white colored pixels, as shown in example 1.\n3. **Interleaving Rows:** Fill to the correct locations, by alternating pixels based on their row.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on discrepancies:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: red (2) at (0, 5) and azure (8) at (9, 7).\n    *   **Expected Output:** Alternating rows of red and azure, starting with the red pixel's row, across the whole row, and propagating down.\n    *   **Actual Output:** Only red and azure colors exist. Only complete rows of these colors and not alternating positions of these colors in the expected positions.\n    *   **Discrepancy:** Missed the row combining aspect and proper color and location interleaving.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: blue (1) at (0, 5) and green (3) at (6, 8).\n    *   **Expected:** Interleaved rows of blue and green pixels across the same row, then duplicated.\n    *   **Actual:** The output shows mostly only lines of all green.\n    *   **Discrepancy:** Incorrect color interleaving. Blue is completely absent.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: red (2) at (5, 0) and green (3) at (7, 8).\n    *   **Expected:** Interleaved rows, where there are complete rows of red, complete rows of green, and alternating rows, which combine into all green.\n    *   **Actual:**\u00a0The transformed output shows only the green lines.\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The output does not represent the interleaving of colors.\n\n*    **Example 4:**\n    *  **Input:**: Two non-white pixels: yellow (4) at row 7 and blue (1) at row 11.\n    * **Expected**: Filled alternating lines, including the alternating lines.\n    * **Actual**: The transformed output only has blue lines.\n    *   **Discrepancy:** The output does not represent the interleaving of colors.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  objects:\n    - color: red\n      value: 2\n      initial_position: (0, 5)\n    - color: azure\n      value: 8\n      initial_position: (9, 7)\n  transformation:\n    - description: \"Create interleaved horizontal lines of red and azure\"\n  outcome: incorrect\n\nexample_2:\n  objects:\n    - color: blue\n      value: 1\n      initial_position: (0, 5)\n    - color: green\n      value: 3\n      initial_position: (6, 8)\n  transformation:\n      - description: \"Create interleaved horizontal lines of blue and green\"\n  outcome: incorrect\n\nexample_3:\n  objects:\n    - color: red\n      value: 2\n      initial_position: (5, 0)\n    - color: green\n      value: 3\n      initial_position: (7, 8)\n  transformation:\n    - description: \"Create interleaved horizontal lines of red and green\"\n  outcome: incorrect\nexample_4:\n  objects:\n    - color: yellow\n      value: 4\n      initial_position: (7, 0)\n    - color: blue\n      value: 1\n      initial_position: (11, 0)\n  transformation:\n    - description: \"Create interleaved horizontal lines of yellow and blue\"\n  outcome: incorrect\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). Note their color and original row and column.\n2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each non-white pixel, create a full row of pixels with its color, starting with the original coordinates.\n3.  **Vertical Interleaving:** Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input. For each row in the output, find the original rows of all non-white pixels in the input. Populate the new row by horizontally expanding the color of any matching pixels in the input. If multiple pixels can be expanded into a grid location, prioritize them in their numeric order, so lower color numbers are overwritten by higher color numbers.\n\n"
