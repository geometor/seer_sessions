Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a flawed understanding of the transformation rule, focusing solely on alternating patterns of 1 and 3. The test results clearly demonstrate this isn't the correct logic. The core issue is that the code doesn't correctly identify *all* non-zero values and replicate them across their respective rows. It also incorrectly handles some colors. Example 1's error demonstrates it does not replicate colors other than 1 and 3. Example 3 has additional rows that should be considered. Example 4 shows additional colors, shows alternating color rows and shows that zero rows should be maintained.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Core Logic:** The fundamental error is not replicating *all* non-zero colors across the row. The code needs to be revised to iterate through each cell, and if a cell has a non-zero value, it should fill the *entire rest of the row* with that same value.
2.  **Zero Rows:** Explicitly handle rows that are all zeros. These rows should remain unchanged in the output. Previous code did not handle zero row preservation.
3. **Eliminate Alternation**: Alternation logic is not supported.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a summary of observations based on all examples:

*   **Example 1:** The original code failed to replicate colors 2 and 8, and filled zeros instead of performing any replication.
*   **Example 2:** The code only replicated values 3, and missed replicating color 1.
*   **Example 3:** The code failed to copy color 2, and did not copy color 3 across the rest of its row. The transformation created additional copies and extended to areas where there was all zeros.
*   **Example 4:** The code failed to replicate colors entirely, it also copied colors to rows that contained only zeros. It also attempted an alternating pattern which is incorrect.

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain various colors represented by integers 0-9.
  - observation: |
      The output grids show a horizontal replication of non-zero colors.
  - observation: |
      If a row contains a non-zero value, that value is replicated across the entire row to the right.
  - observation: |
     Rows containing only zeros in the input remain all zeros in the output.
  - object: rows
    properties:
      contains_non_zero: boolean
    actions:
      replicate_non_zero: |
        If a row contains a non-zero value, replicate that value to all cells to its right within that row.
      preserve_zeros: |
        If a row contains only zeros, it remains unchanged in the output.
  - object: cells
    properties:
        value: integer (0-9) representing color.
        is_zero: boolean (true if value is 0, false otherwise)
    actions:
       replicate_value: |
          If the cell's value isn't 0, its value overwrites all cells to its right in the row.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the current row contains *any* non-zero values.
3.  **If the row contains only zeros:** Leave the row unchanged in the output grid.
4.  **If the row contains a non-zero value:**
    *   Iterate through each cell in that row.
    *   If a cell has a non-zero value, replicate that value across the *remaining* part of the row (to the right).

This revised program addresses all observed errors: it replicates *all* non-zero colors, handles zero-only rows correctly, and performs replication across the entire row, as seen in the expected outputs. The alternating color scheme has been removed.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
