Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of horizontal expansion and vertical repetition was partially correct but failed to capture the core logic of alternating rows and combining information from multiple non-white pixels correctly. The code also seems to have trouble with the concept of interleaving different colors based on original position, and instead only shows one of the non-white pixel colors. The results consistently fail because the combination or mixing of multiple colored rows is not happening as described in the expected output, especially in example 1.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct Alternation:** The current alternation logic is flawed. It only considers a mod 2 relationship to the orignal row, but we must instead maintain the original row of each colored pixel, and copy to the other locations.
2.  **Multiple Non-White Pixels:** Handle multiple non-white pixels correctly by applying the fill, and making use of all the non-white colored pixels, as shown in example 1.
3. **Interleaving Rows:** Fill to the correct locations, by alternating pixels based on their row.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on discrepancies:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: red (2) at (0, 5) and azure (8) at (9, 7).
    *   **Expected Output:** Alternating rows of red and azure, starting with the red pixel's row, across the whole row, and propagating down.
    *   **Actual Output:** Only red and azure colors exist. Only complete rows of these colors and not alternating positions of these colors in the expected positions.
    *   **Discrepancy:** Missed the row combining aspect and proper color and location interleaving.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: blue (1) at (0, 5) and green (3) at (6, 8).
    *   **Expected:** Interleaved rows of blue and green pixels across the same row, then duplicated.
    *   **Actual:** The output shows mostly only lines of all green.
    *   **Discrepancy:** Incorrect color interleaving. Blue is completely absent.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Two non-white pixels: red (2) at (5, 0) and green (3) at (7, 8).
    *   **Expected:** Interleaved rows, where there are complete rows of red, complete rows of green, and alternating rows, which combine into all green.
    *   **Actual:** The transformed output shows only the green lines.
    *   **Discrepancy:** The output does not represent the interleaving of colors.

*    **Example 4:**
    *  **Input:**: Two non-white pixels: yellow (4) at row 7 and blue (1) at row 11.
    * **Expected**: Filled alternating lines, including the alternating lines.
    * **Actual**: The transformed output only has blue lines.
    *   **Discrepancy:** The output does not represent the interleaving of colors.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0). Note their color and original row and column.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each non-white pixel, create a full row of pixels with its color, starting with the original coordinates.
3.  **Vertical Interleaving:** Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input. For each row in the output, find the original rows of all non-white pixels in the input. Populate the new row by horizontally expanding the color of any matching pixels in the input. If multiple pixels can be expanded into a grid location, prioritize them in their numeric order, so lower color numbers are overwritten by higher color numbers.
