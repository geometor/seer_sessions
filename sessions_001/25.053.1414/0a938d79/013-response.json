Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input grid contains single, isolated instances of red and green pixels, while the output grid transforms these into horizontal lines of the same color, repeated vertically in a pattern.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Alternate rows with orignal locations for red and green, so one row of red, then a row of white, the next a row of green and a row of white, etc, throughout the entire grid. If lines of different colors are on top of each other, they will overwrite each other in the order red and green pixels.\n\n"
