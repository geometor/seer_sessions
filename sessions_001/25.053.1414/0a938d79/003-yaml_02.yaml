objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable  # Height and width can vary.
      cells: pixels
      colors: 0-9  # Representing different colors.
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      coordinates: (x, y)  # (column, row)
  - type: source_row
    properties:
      row_index: integer
      source_pixels: list of pixels  # Pixels within the row that have non-zero color.
    behavior:  # Actions performed on the source_row
      replication: |
          The pattern of non-zero pixels in a source row is replicated
          across the entire row, and then vertically down the grid, creating stripes.
          Blank rows (all zero) will propagate the pattern from above until another source_row is found.
