The input grid appears to have a sparse distribution of colors (mostly white, with a few red and azure pixels), while the output grid has a much denser, repeating pattern of red and azure pixels, seemingly derived from the locations of the original non-white pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain the same (height and width).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Record the color and (x, y) coordinates of each of these \"source pixels\".\n2.  **Columnar Expansion:** For each source pixel found:\n    *   Create a full column in the output grid at the x-coordinate (column) of the source pixel.\n    *   Fill this column with the color of the source pixel.\n3.  **Alternating Fill:** For each remaining column in the output, alternate the color of each source colors, left to right. For example, fill the column immediately to the right of first column with a different source color. If a source pixel is present, create a column with that color; otherwise, use the alternate color.\n4. **Maintain Grid size**: The input and output grids have the same dimensions.\n\nIn simpler terms: The original colored pixels act as \"seeds\". Each seed grows into a vertical column of its color. The spaces between these columns are filled with alternating columns of each of the seed colors.\n"
