The input grid seems to contain mostly 0s (white), with a few instances of 1 (blue) and 3 (green). The output grid has the same dimensions, but the single instances of '1' and '3' in the input seem to have been replicated to create a repeating pattern of alternating '1' and '3' values across the entire row and maintains the initial column placement.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The output grid will have the same dimensions.\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Create an output grid filled with 0s (white), matching the input grid's dimensions.\n3.  **Iterate Rows:** For each row in the input grid:\n    *   **Iterate Columns:** For each cell (pixel) in the current row:\n        *    Check Value: Examine current input cell value.\n        *    **Replication Rule:**\n             *   If the input cell's value is 1 (blue):\n                 *   Starting at current column, fill the output row, alternating between 1 and 3 until the end of the row.\n             *   If the input cell's value is 3 (green):\n                 *   Starting at current column, fill the output row, alternating between 3 and 1 until the end of the row.\n             * If the input is 0, leave corresponding output cell as 0\n\nIn essence the program scans each row of the input. When it finds a 1 or a 3, it replaces the rest of the row with an alternating sequence of 1s and 3s (or 3s and 1s), starting with the value that was found. The column position of the initial digit is preserved.\n"
