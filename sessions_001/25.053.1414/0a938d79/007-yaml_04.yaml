facts:
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions."
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D array (rows x columns)
      - cells: "contain single-digit integers (0-9)"
      - color_map: "0: white, 1: blue, 3: green"
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: "determined by color_map"
      - position: (row, column)
  - action: replication
    description: "Values 1 and 3 are replicated horizontally."
    details: "The replication alternates between 1 and 3 across the entire row, starting with the original position of the digit."
  - relationship: "positional_transformation"
    description: "Non-zero values in the input grid trigger a horizontal replication in the output grid at the same row."
