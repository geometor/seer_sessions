The output grid seems to be a cropped and filtered version of the input. Specifically, it appears to isolate the large red (2) region in the bottom-left of the input grid, removing a significant border of surrounding azure and white pixels, the output grid includes the lower left corner. The shape is not changed\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"
