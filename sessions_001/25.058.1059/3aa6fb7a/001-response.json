The primary color observed is azure (8) and white (0) and blue (1) in the output. The azure pixels appear to form distinct objects, possibly based on contiguity. The transformation seems to involve a change in some of the azure (8) pixels to blue (1).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Each block is treated as a separate object.\n2.  **Select Pixels for change:** If any single azure pixel within an object touches a boundary (edge) of the overall input grid, then change that specific pixel to value blue (1). If any single azure pixel is adjacent (up, down, left, right) to another azure pixel of same object do not change the pixel to value 1.\n3. **Apply transformation:** Update the output grid to represent the changed color.\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (non-azure or not selected for change) retain their original values in the output grid.\n\nIn essence, the single azure pixels touching the edge within each azure object is changed from azure (8) to blue (1).\n"
