The primary color observed is azure (8) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve the introduction of blue (1) pixels in the output grid, specifically in locations where the azure (8) pixels are present in the input, based on a specific condition.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

Check how many azure pixels exist in all the neighbors in all directions, excluding diagonals.\n    *    If the number of adjacent azure pixels is exactly one, replace the pixel with the color blue (value 1) in the output grid.\n    *    otherwise, maintain the color of the pixels (azure (8)).\n3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (those not azure in the input) remain unchanged in the output grid (value 0).\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation replaces azure (8) pixels with blue (1) pixels if and only if the azure pixel has only one neighbor in the north, south, east, or west direction that is also azure. Otherwise, keep the azure color.\n"
