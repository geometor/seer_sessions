            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided training examples and the results of the current code, along with a revised natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of outlining magenta objects. However, the additional training examples reveal a crucial oversight: the code *only* considers magenta objects and makes everything else black. The other examples show that non-magenta objects should *not* be discarded, but rather remain unchanged. The strategy, therefore, is to modify the code to preserve non-magenta objects while still outlining the magenta ones. The existing `find_objects` function is helpful and can be reused. The `get_object_outline` function also works correctly. The main change will be in the `transform` function.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nTo be precise, I'll analyze each example pair. Let represent input grids by `I` and output grids by `O`.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   `I`: One magenta rectangle.\n    *   `O`: Outline of the magenta rectangle.\n    *   Result: Correct.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *    `I`: One magenta rectangle and a separate green object.\n    *    `O`: Outline of magenta rectangle; green object remains unchanged.\n    *   Result: **Incorrect**. The green object was removed.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   `I`: One magenta rectangle and one gray object inside of it.\n    *   `O`: Outline of magenta rectangle; gray object remains unchanged.\n    *   Result: **Incorrect**. The gray object was removed.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_1:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: magenta\n            shape: rectangle\n            outline: true\n        transformations:\n          - outline: magenta\n      output:\n        objects:\n          - color: magenta\n            shape: outline rectangle\n  - example_2:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: magenta\n            shape: rectangle\n            outline: true\n          - color: green\n            shape: irregular\n        transformations:\n          - outline: magenta\n          - preserve: green\n      output:\n        objects:\n          - color: magenta\n            shape: outline rectangle\n          - color: green\n            shape: irregular\n  - example_3:\n      input:\n        objects:\n          - color: magenta\n            shape: rectangle\n            outline: true\n          - color: gray\n            shape: irregular\n        transformations:\n          - outline: magenta\n          - preserve: gray\n      output:\n        objects:\n          - color: magenta\n            shape: outline rectangle\n          - color: gray\n            shape: irregular\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions of the same color in the input grid. These constitute the objects.\n2.  **Process Magenta Objects:** For each object, if its color is magenta, find its outline. Replace the magenta object with its outline.\n3.  **Preserve Other Objects:** All other non-magenta objects found in the input grid should be kept without modification.\n4. **Construct Output:** combine updated magenta outlines and other color objects to create a complete output.\n\n"
