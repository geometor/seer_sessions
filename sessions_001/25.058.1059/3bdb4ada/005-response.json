            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: targeting horizontal rectangles and modifying their middle rows. However, the initial approach has one key flaw: it should *only* consider rectangles with a height greater than 1. This ensures that only actual rectangles, not single lines, are processed. The provided results show this is a problem. The current implementation correctly handles the checkerboard pattern within the middle row.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Refine Rectangle Selection:** Update the `find_rectangles` or `transform` method to explicitly filter and ignore rectangles of height=1 to ensure only rectangles with a height greater than one are processed, not single horizontal lines..\n2.  **Maintain Checkerboard Logic:** Keep the existing logic for alternating colors (checkerboard pattern) within the middle row of valid rectangles.\n3. **Preserve Other Pixels** Keep all other pixels that are not part of the horizontal rectangles, as is.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (from code execution and provided examples):**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef code_execution(input_grid, output_grid, transformed_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides detailed comparison metrics between the expected output and the transformed grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    results = {}\n\n    # 1.
