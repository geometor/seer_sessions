Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are yellow (4), azure (8), and white (0). The input grid contains three distinct horizontal rectangular blocks of color. The output seems to modify only some areas, by \"poking\" a hole into the colored blocks.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
