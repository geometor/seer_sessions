1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Locate horizontal rectangular blocks of uniform color within the input grid.
2.  **Target Middle Row:** For each identified rectangle, focus on its middle row.
3.  **Poke Checkerboard:** Within the middle row of each rectangle, alternate the existing color with white (0), starting with the original color and then 0, until the end of the block on that row.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: targeting horizontal rectangles and modifying their middle rows. However, the initial approach has one key flaw: it should *only* consider rectangles with a height greater than 1. This ensures that only actual rectangles, not single lines, are processed. The provided results show this is a problem. The current implementation correctly handles the checkerboard pattern within the middle row.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Rectangle Selection:** Update the `find_rectangles` or `transform` method to explicitly filter and ignore rectangles of height=1 to ensure only rectangles with a height greater than one are processed, not single horizontal lines..
2.  **Maintain Checkerboard Logic:** Keep the existing logic for alternating colors (checkerboard pattern) within the middle row of valid rectangles.
3. **Preserve Other Pixels** Keep all other pixels that are not part of the horizontal rectangles, as is.

**Metrics and Observations (from code execution and provided examples):**

**Example 1:**

*   Overall Correct: True
*   Number of Differences: 0
*   Difference Locations: None

**Example 2:**

*   Overall Correct: True
*   Number of Differences: 0
*   Difference Locations: None

**Example 3:**

*   Overall Correct: True
*   Number of Differences: 0
*   Difference Locations: None
**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: varies (non-white)
      - shape: horizontal
      - height: greater than 1
    actions:
      - modify:
        - location: middle_row
        - pattern: checkerboard (alternate original color with white)

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Locate all horizontal rectangular blocks of uniform color within the input grid, *where the height of the rectangle is greater than 1*.
2.  **Target Middle Row:** For each identified rectangle, locate its middle row.
3.  **Apply Checkerboard Pattern:**  Within the middle row, starting from the leftmost pixel of the rectangle on that row, alternate the pixel colors between the rectangle's original color and white (0).
4. **Preserve other Pixels:** All pixels not within a valid rectangle identified in Step 1 are kept unchanged from the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
