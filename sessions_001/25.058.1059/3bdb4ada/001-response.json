The primary colors involved are yellow (4), azure (8), blue (1), and orange (7), with white (0) seemingly acting as a background or separator. The transformation seems to involve a consistent alteration of colored regions, specifically, an insertion of a white (0) pixel at every other position within each colored, contiguous, horizontal block, along rows where they originally formed a continuous line.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
