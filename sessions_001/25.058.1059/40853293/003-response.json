The colors include white (0), red (2), green (3), yellow(4), gray(5), magenta (6), and azure (8).\n*   **Output:** A 30x30 grid with a similar structure to the input. Some single pixels remain unchanged. New areas of colored pixels extend from some of the original pixels.\n* **Transformation:** It appears the single pixels in the input are extended. The single red pixel is extended vertically upwards. The single azure pixel is extended vertically downwards. The single green and the gray/white/magenta extend in both directions, with some areas duplicated, to form colored lines.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
