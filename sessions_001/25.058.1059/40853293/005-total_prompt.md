Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify "seed" pixels:** Locate all single, isolated pixels of colors red, green, azure, magenta, white and gray in the input grid.
2.  **Red Extension:** For the red pixel, extend it vertically upwards, maintaining the red color, until it reaches the top edge of the grid.
3.  **Azure Extension:** For the azure pixel, extend it vertically downwards, maintaining the azure color, until it reaches the bottom edge of the grid.
4.  **Green, Magenta, White, Gray Extension:**
     - copy all pixels of these colors 6 times to the right,
     - the magenta pixel also has the gray pixels to the left and right.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
