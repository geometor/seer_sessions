Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan to refine the natural language program and the code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the vertical expansion of yellow pixels. It also introduced a novel approach for horizontal expansion of other colors, guided by the expanded yellow regions. However, the logic for `expand_horizontally` isn't fully accurate, as seen in failures in examples 3 and 5. The primary issue is that non-yellow pixels should influence *all* yellow cells in a row, filling until the edges or other non-background cells. The horizontal fill does not only involve columns which *currently* contain a yellow, but should treat *all* yellow pixels in the affected rows as a single object.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Horizontal Expansion:** The `expand_horizontally` function needs to be revised. Instead of just filling in the current yellow columns for each row, we should check if a row contains *any* yellow. If it does, and it also contains any other non-background, non-yellow pixel, then *all* background (0-value) pixels between the first non-background and the last, in that row, should become the color of the other, non-yellow pixel.
2. **Re-evaluate assumptions** Check if the vertical expansion rule is still valid after reviewing all the test results.
3.  **Iterative Testing:** After modifying the code, we'll rerun the `run_and_check` function to verify against all training examples.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's analyze each example's result:

*   **Example 1:** `correct: True` - The code works as expected.
*   **Example 2:** `correct: True` - The code works as expected.
*   **Example 3:** `correct: False`
    *   Input has a yellow (4) at (1, 3), a blue (1) at (3, 2), and a red (2) at (5, 6).
    *   The code correctly expands the yellow vertically.
    *   The code *incorrectly* copies blue in column 3 and red in columns 3 and 6 in the respective rows
    *   Expected: rows 3,4,5 should have blue from col 2 all the way until the yellow.
*   **Example 4:** `correct: True` - The code works as expected.
*   **Example 5:** `correct: False`

    *   Input has a yellow (4) at (0, 4), a purple(7) at (0,0) and a maroon(9)
        at(3,1), and a red(2) at (3,4)
    *   The code correctly expands the yellow vertically.
    *   The code *incorrectly* fills all the yellow columns in the rows 3, 4, 5
        with blue (1), orange (7) and red(4), but should treat it as a contiguous
        horizontal fill

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [0-9] # Represents color values
      position: (row, col) # Grid coordinates

  - type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: [0-9]
      pixels: list of (row, col)
      shape: can be irregular

actions:
  - name: expand_vertically
    object: yellow_pixel
    description: Extends a yellow pixel downwards until a non-background or non-yellow pixel or the grid edge is encountered.
    constraints:
      direction: down
      stop_condition: non-zero and non-yellow pixel, or edge of grid

  - name: expand_horizontally_and_fill
    object: colored_pixel (non-yellow)
    description: >-
      If a row contains both a yellow pixel and another non-background,
      non-yellow colored pixel, the background pixels between the leftmost
      and rightmost non-background pixels are filled with the color of that
      other pixel.
    constraints:
      scope: row-based
      condition: presence of yellow and another non-background, non-yellow color in the same row

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Yellow Pixels:** Locate all pixels with a value of 4 (yellow).

2.  **Vertical Expansion (Yellow):** For each yellow pixel, extend its color (4) downwards in its column. Stop when either the bottom edge of the grid is reached, or a pixel with a value other than 0 (background) or 4 (yellow) is encountered.

3.  **Horizontal Expansion and Fill (Other Colors):** For each row, perform the following:

    *   Check for the presence of both yellow pixels (4) and at least one other non-background pixel (not 0) with a different color.
    *   If both conditions are met, find the leftmost and rightmost non-background pixels in that row.
    *   Fill all background pixels (0) between the leftmost and rightmost non-background pixels with the color of the non-yellow, non-background pixel found in that row. If there are more than one non-yellow colors on a row, they act as 'stoppers' and independently cause filling from their side.

This natural language program clarifies the "horizontal expansion" rule, making it a "fill" operation that's dependent on both the presence of yellow and other colored pixels within the same row. The filling is bounded, ensuring it doesn't extend across the entire row if obstructions exist.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
