            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to all cases. The core idea of identifying \"seed\" pixels and extending/copying them is partially correct, but the specifics of *which* pixels to extend, *how* to extend them, and *under what conditions* need refinement. The provided code includes the \"find\\_seed\\_pixels\" which is not perfect, so it needs to be debugged.\n\nThe strategy will be to:\n\n1.  **Analyze each example pair:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output. Identify discrepancies.\n2.  **Refine seed pixel identification:** The current `find_seed_pixels` function has limitations. It aims to find isolated pixels, but its isolation check is too strict. It doesn't handle cases where isolated objects of same colors are to close together.\n3.  **Adjust extension/copying rules:** The rules for extending red and azure, and copying green, magenta, white, and gray are not universally applicable. We need to derive rules based on *all* examples.\n4.    Pay close attention when seed pixels are near the border, where the original code would extend outside the bounds.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**\n\nBecause this is the dream phase, I will just outline how I would use a code_execution block to derive information and what that would mean for my next steps. I can't use one myself in this context, so I will include comments in the code to describe this:\n\n```python\n# Example Analysis (Conceptual - would be done with a code_execution call)\n\n# for each example pair (input_grid, expected_output):\n#   actual_output = transform(input_grid)\n#   diff = (actual_output != expected_output)\n#   num_diff_pixels = np.sum(diff)\n#   print(f\"Example: {example_number}\")\n#   print(f\"Number of differing pixels: {num_diff_pixels}\")\n#   print(\"Input Grid:\")\n#   print(input_grid)\n#   print(\"Expected Output:\")\n#   print(expected_output)\n#   print(\"Actual Output:\")\n#   print(actual_output)\n#   print(\"Difference (True where different):\")\n#   print(diff)\n#   # Analyze where the differences are, and why:\n#   # 1.  Is a seed pixel missed?  Why? (Check find_seed_pixels logic)\n#   # 2.  Is the extension/copying wrong? Why? (Check extension logic)\n#   # 3.  Is there an interaction I'm not accounting for? (New rule needed)\n    # 4.  Bounds checking - Is the code writing off of the array?\n    #   seed_pixels = find_seed_pixels(input_grid)\n    #   print(f\"Detected seed pixels: {seed_pixels}\")\n#   print(\"-\" * 20)\n    #Example results\n    # example0 - 0 differing pixels\n    # example1 - 11 differing pixels - the magenta object is incorrectly handled.\n    #           the seed pixel is correctly detected.\n    #           the magenta color is extended in both directions by 1.\n    # example2 - 7 differing pixels - the gray object is incorrectly handled\n    #             the seed pixel is correctly detected.\n    #             should extend the gray pixel down\n    # example3 - 4 differing pixels - the gray object is incorrectly handled\n    #             the seed pixel is correctly detected.\n    #             should extend the gray pixel down\n    # example4 - 4 differing pixels\n\n```\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: red_line\n    type: vertical_line\n    color: red\n    start_condition: single_red_pixel\n    action: extend_to_top\n\n  - object: azure_line\n    type: vertical_line\n    color: azure\n    start_condition: single_azure_pixel\n    action: extend_to_bottom\n\n  - object: magenta_line\n    type: horizontal_line\n    color: magenta\n    start_condition: single_magenta_pixel\n    action: extend_bidirectional_1\n\n  - object: gray_line\n    type: vertical_line\n    color: gray\n    start_condition: single_gray_pixel, on_row_3_or_below #Added the row condition.\n    action: extend_to_bottom\n\n  - object: green_block\n    type: horizontal_line\n    color: green\n    start_condition: single_green_pixel\n    action: extend_horizontal, make length 4\n\n  - object: white_block\n    type: horizontal_line\n    color: white\n    start_condition: single_white_pixel\n    action: extend_horizontal\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Find all *single* pixels of colors red, azure, magenta, gray, green, and white. A single pixel is defined as a pixel that does *not* have an adjacent neighbor (up, down, left, or right) of the same color.\n\n2.  **Red Extension:** If a single red pixel is found, extend it vertically upwards to the top edge of the grid, changing those pixels to red.\n\n3.  **Azure Extension:** If a single azure pixel is found, extend it vertically downwards to the bottom edge of the grid, changing those pixels to azure.\n\n4.  **Magenta Extension:** If a single magenta pixel exists, extend it by *one* pixel horizontally in *both* directions (left and right).\n\n5.  **Gray Extension:** If a single gray pixel is found, *and* if that pixel is on row index 3 or greater, extend it downwards to the bottom.\n\n6.  **Green Extension:** If a single green pixel if found, extend it to the right until it makes the green object to 4 pixels long in total.\n\n7.  **White Extension:** If a single white pixel if found, extend it to the right until it makes the white object to 7 pixels long in total.\n"
