            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good start, capturing the basic idea of replicating a yellow pixel. However, it's clear from the additional training examples that the replication rule isn't universally applicable and needs adjustments. The original rule assumed expansion below the original yellow pixel, both vertically and horizontally. The tests show that the rule doesn't correctly account for situations where there are objects obstructing the expected placement of the yellow pixels, and the replication direction could be more generalized. The provided code does not sufficiently handle the concept of objectness - in this task, the black lines serve as boundaries beyond which the effect cannot cross.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Object Boundaries:** Incorporate the concept of object boundaries (specifically, the black pixels, represented by 0) into the replication logic. The yellow expansion should stop when it encounters a black pixel.\n2.  **Generalized replication direction:** Identify the correct transformation with respect to the initial location of the yellow cells. It seems that the replication occurs around the yellow pixel, not only below.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo understand the errors better, I'll analyze each example pair and the code's output. I'll describe the expected transformation according to a *corrected* program hypothesis, and compare it to the actual output of the current code.\n\n*Example Pair 1:*\n\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 4 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 4 0 0 0]\n [0 0 4 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\nCode Output:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 4 0 0 0]\n [0 0 4 0 0 0]\n [0 0 4 0 0 0]]\n\nCorrect Output\n\n```\n\n*Example Pair 2:*\n\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\nCode Output:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\nCorrect Output\n```\n\n*Example Pair 3:*\n\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 4 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\nOutput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 4 0]\n [0 0 0 4 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0]]\n\nCode Output:\n[[0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 4 0]\n [0 0 0 4 0]\n [0 0 0 4 0]]\n\nCorrect Output\n```\n*Example Pair 4:*\n```\nInput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\nOutput:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\nCode Output:\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 4 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]\n [0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - type: pixel\n    color: yellow\n    value: 4\n    role: initiator\n    properties:\n      initial_position: varies\n  - type: pixel\n    color: black\n    value: 0\n    role: boundary\n    properties:\n      shape: line\n      position: surrounds_initiator\n\nactions:\n  - name: replicate\n    agent: yellow_pixel\n    constraints:\n      - type: boundary\n        object: black_pixel\n      - type: direction\n        specification: \"every other row, horizontally and vertically\"\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Initiator:** Locate the initial yellow pixel (value 4) within the input grid.\n2.  **Replicate with Constraints:** Starting from the row and column of the initial yellow pixel perform the following:\n    *   From that initial position, and for every other row *above and below* the original, if the cell in the same column is not black (value 0), set it to yellow (value 4).\n    * From that initial position, and for every other row *above and below* the original,\n        *   if the cell one position to the left of the original is not black (value 0), set it to yellow (value 4).\n        *   if the cell one position to the right of the original column is not black (value 0), and, set it to yellow (value 4).\n3. **Boundary Condition.** The replication in any direction stops if it encounters a black pixel (value 0) or goes out of the grid boundary.\n\n"
