Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Initiator:** Locate the initial yellow pixel (value 4) within the input grid.
2.  **Replicate with Constraints:** Starting from the row and column of the initial yellow pixel perform the following:
    *   From that initial position, and for every other row *above and below* the original, if the cell in the same column is not black (value 0), set it to yellow (value 4).
    * From that initial position, and for every other row *above and below* the original,
        *   if the cell one position to the left of the original is not black (value 0), set it to yellow (value 4).
        *   if the cell one position to the right of the original column is not black (value 0), and, set it to yellow (value 4).
3. **Boundary Condition.** The replication in any direction stops if it encounters a black pixel (value 0) or goes out of the grid boundary.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
