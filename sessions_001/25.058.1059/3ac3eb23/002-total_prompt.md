**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The input grids contain a few non-zero pixels (colored cells) on a background of zeros (white cells). The output grids appear to be derived from the input grids by replicating and alternating non-zero colors vertically.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 6x10, 6x7)
      - cells: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replicate_and_alternate
    description: Replicates non-zero pixels vertically in an alternating pattern.

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains original non-zero pixels.
  - output_grid: generated by replicating and alternating non-zero pixels from the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-zero Pixels:** Iterate through the input grid and locate all pixels with non-zero values (colors other than white).

2.  **Vertical Replication and Alternation:** For each non-zero pixel found:
    *   Replicate the pixel's color in the corresponding column of the output grid.
    * Starting from the row immediately below, the non-zero pixel's color is filled.
    *   Continue to fill the color, leaving one row blank and filling one row
        color.
    * The replication is performed in every alternate row, creating a striped pattern.

3.  **Background:** All other cells in the output grid that were not filled in the above steps remain 0 (white).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
