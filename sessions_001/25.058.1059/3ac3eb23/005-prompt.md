Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all red (2) and azure (8) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Replicate Red Pixels:** For each red pixel:
    *   Create a red pixel directly beneath it.
    *   Create a red pixel diagonally down and to the left.
    * Repeat these two sub-steps until the red color will go out-of-bounds of the grid

3.  **Replicate Azure Pixels:** For each azure pixel:
    *   Create a azure pixel directly beneath it.
    *    Create an azure pixel diagonally down and to the left.
    * Repeat these two sub-steps until the azure color will go out-of-bounds of the grid.

4.  **Output:** Combine all the replicated pixels, along with the original white background, to form the output grid. All the original pixels stay put, replication happens based on their positions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
