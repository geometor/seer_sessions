Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 12x12 grid containing pixels of colors represented by integers 0, 2, and 8 (white, red, and azure). There are distinct regions of azure (8) on the left, red (2) on the top right, and white (0) in the interior and a few other places.
*   **Output Grid:** The same 12x12 grid. The red (2) and azure (8) regions are largely unchanged. Some of the white (0) pixels in the input have been replaced with green (3) pixels in the output, particularly in the central area. The green forms a rectangular block and there appears to be a pattern connected to the locations of azure and red.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 12x12
    elements: pixels
    colors: [0, 2, 3, 8] # white, red, green, azure

  - type: region
    color: 2 # red
    location: top_right

  - type: region
    color: 8 # azure
    location: left_and_bottom

  - type: region
    color: 0 # white
    location: interior

  - type: region
    color: 3 # green
    location: interior
    shape: rectangle

actions:
  - type: replace
    source_color: 0 # white
    target_color: 3 # green
    condition: specific_locations # To be defined in the program

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Green region is adjacent to white, azure, and red regions

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate the regions of red (2) pixels at the top right, azure (8) pixels on the left and bottom, and white (0) pixels in the rest of the grid.

2.  **Define Green Region Boundaries:**
    *   Find the inner most azure pixels, this can be done by checking pixels with azure value that has white pixel neighbor
    *   Starting on the 4th row from top and 4th column from left. Fill area with green until the 9th row and 9th column. There is an interruption.

3. Replace: All white pixels inside the rectangle will be green color, except those are next to red pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
