There are distinct regions of azure (8) on the left, red (2) on the top right, and white (0) in the interior and a few other places.\n*   **Output Grid:** The same 12x12 grid. The red (2) and azure (8) regions are largely unchanged. Some of the white (0) pixels in the input have been replaced with green (3) pixels in the output, particularly in the central area. The green forms a rectangular block and there appears to be a pattern connected to the locations of azure and red.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
