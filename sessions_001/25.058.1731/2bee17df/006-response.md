Here's an analysis of the provided examples and the results of the current code, along with a strategy for improvement, documented facts, and a refined natural language program:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identified the bounding box and the filling with green. It also correctly identifies the exception for cells adjacent to red. However, the code doesn't account for the variable size and position of the white region within the azure frame, nor is the definition of "inner" azure pixels robust. The code also has hardcoded values, that do not generalize.

The strategy is to:

1.  **Dynamically locate the white region:** Instead of hardcoding the bounds (3,9), find the actual white region within the azure frame dynamically, by scanning for rows and columns that consist only of azure.
2.  **Refine "inner" pixel selection:** Develop an algorithm using the flood fill to select pixels.

**Example Metrics and Results Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, using the code's output and comparing it to the expected output:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 15x15, Output Shape: 15x15
    *   White Region: 9x6, bounded by azure.
    *   Red Pixel: (11,11)
    *   Result: Correct. The code correctly fills the white region, excepting the pixel adjacent to red.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 12x12, Output Shape: 12x12
    *   White Region: 6x6, bounded by azure.
    *   Red Pixel: (8, 9)
    *   Result: Correct. The code correctly fills the white region, excepting the pixel adjacent to red.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 9x9, Output Shape: 9x9
    *   White Region: 4x3, bounded by azure.
    *   Red Pixel: (6, 6)
    *   Result: Correct. The code correctly fills the white region, excepting the pixel adjacent to red.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: "The input grid contains a rectangular region of white pixels surrounded by a frame of azure pixels."
    objects:
      - name: "White Region"
        attributes:
          - color: white
          - shape: rectangle
      - name: "Azure Frame"
        attributes:
          - color: azure
          - shape: frame
          - surrounds: "White Region"
      - name: "Red Pixel"
        attributes:
          - color: red
          - shape: single pixel
          - location: "within Azure Frame, adjacent to White Region"
  - description: "The output grid replaces the white pixels within the azure frame with green pixels, except for pixels adjacent to the red pixel."
    actions:
      - name: "Fill White Region"
        transformation:
          - from: white
          - to: green
        condition: "within Azure Frame and not adjacent to Red Pixel"
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Azure Frame:** Find the outermost rectangle of azure (8) pixels.
2.  **Identify the Inner White region:** Within the azure frame, locate the contiguous rectangular region of white (0) pixels.
3.  **Locate the Red Pixel:** Find the single red (2) pixel within the azure frame.
4.  **Fill with Green:** Change all white (0) pixels within the inner white region to green (3), *except* for any white pixel that shares an edge (up, down, left, or right) with the red pixel.
