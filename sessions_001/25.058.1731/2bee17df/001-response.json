The most frequent colors in these examples are white (0), azure (8), red (2), and green(3).\n*   **Shapes:** There are distinct regions or shapes of white (0) surrounded by borders of azure(8) and red(2).\n*    **Change:** there is a connected region of white (0) pixels in the input that, in the output, is colored green (3)\n*   **Background:** The azure(8) and red(2) colors remain constant between the input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

These regions don't change in color.\n\n2.  **Locate the contiguous area to transform:** Within the frame formed by the red(2) and azure(8) area, locate the biggest connected white(0) area.\n\n3.  **Recolor the shape** Every pixel within that located area changes its color from white (0) to green (3).\n\n4.   **Preserve Other colors:** ensure that the red (2) and azure(8) color pixels remain unchanged in color and place.\n\nIn short we can say that the program takes all the largest connected area of color white(0) inside a frame of colors red(2) and azure(8), and changes their color into green(3). Everything else remains unchanged.\n"
