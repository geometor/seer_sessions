Okay, let's analyze this input-output example to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain digits representing colors (0-9).
*   The dominant colors are azure (8), white (0), red (2), and green(3).
*    The input grid seems to have a large connected region, or several connected regions of white(0) surrounded by azure(8). The right most column is all red(2). The lower right and lower left corners contains additional red(2) cells, connected to the rightmost red(2) column.
*  The output maintains the overall structure, the right most column and lower connected parts are unchanged.
*  Some, but not all, of the white (0) pixels in the input have become green (3) in the output. It seems likely that the change is related to position relative to the surrounding blue and red regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [0, 2, 3, 8]  # white, red, green, azure

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

  - type: region
    properties:
       color: integer
       pixels: list of pixels

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    target: pixel
    properties:
      from_color: 0 #white
      to_color: 3 #green
    conditions:
        - "pixel is white"
        - "pixel's original location influences if it will be transformed."

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [pixel, pixel]
  - type: containment
    between: [region, pixel]
  - type: connectivity
    between: pixels of same color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into contiguous regions of the same color.
2.  **Preserve Red:** The red (2) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
3. **Preserve Azure:** The azure (8) pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.
4.  **Transform White:**
    Some White (0) pixels are transformed into green (3) pixels, other White pixels are unchanged.
    The transformation appears to be based on some kind of influence rule, where a white pixel becomes green under a specific influence.
    Starting from row 6, all white cells contiguous to azure region at row 6 become green.
    It is recursive, as the contiguous white pixels to the new green pixels also become green.

In summary, the rule preserves azure and red pixels, and changes some white pixels to green based a recursive propagation rule. The transformation starts on row 6, where white cells adjacent to azure cells become green.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
