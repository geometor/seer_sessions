Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. There are distinct colored regions (objects) within the grid. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid. The modifications include some color changes and what appears to be a mirroring or reflection of certain pixels across a central vertical axis, but only for some specific objects. It seems only some specific colors have been added, and some colors remained unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 10x10 grids.
  - object: background
    color: 0 (white)
    property: Unchanged in most areas.
  - object: azure_region
    color: 8 (azure)
    property: Present in both input and output, appears to be a central object.
  - object: magenta_pixel
    color: 6 (magenta)
    initial_position: (3,0)
    final_position: (3,0) and (3,3)
  - object: orange_pixel
      color: 7 (orange)
      initial_position: (0,4)
      final_position: (0,4) and (3,4)
  - object: green_pixel
      color: 3 (green)
      initial_position: (7,0)
      final_position: (7,0) and (7,3)
  - object: blue_pixel
      color: 1 (blue)
      initial_position: (9,5)
      final_position: (9,5) and (7,5)
  - object: red_pixel
    color: 2 (red)
    initial_position: (5,9)
    final_position: (5,9) and (5,5)
  - transformation: reflection
    description: Selected single pixels are potentially mirrored across the left edge of central azure object.
  - transformation: color_modification
    description: colors of some specific individual pixels have been duplicated next to the azure central object

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the single pixels of magenta (6), orange (7), green (3), blue (1) and red (2) in the input grid.
2.  **Central Object:** Find the azure (8) colored object.
3. **Reflection/Duplication:**
    For each key pixel identified in step 1 check if they are far from the left border of the Azure object:
      - If it is adjacent to azure, nothing happens to the pixel
      - duplicate their colors to the cell adjacent to the left most vertical border of the central azure object at the same height.

In short: Duplicate some specific single pixels on the left of the leftmost position of the central azure object.
