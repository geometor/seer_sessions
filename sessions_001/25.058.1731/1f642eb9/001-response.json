There are distinct \"objects\" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. There's a consistent background of '0' (white). The input grids contain a prominent azure (8) colored object, often rectangular, and a few single-pixel objects of other colors. The transformation seems to involve a complex interaction between the colors of the single-pixel objects, and to a lesser degree, a repositioning.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Consider single pixels as individual objects.\n2.  **Preserve Background**: Copy all background color from input to ouput.\n3.  **Copy the azure object:** Copy the azure colored pixels from input to same location.\n4.  **Process Single-Pixel Objects:** For each single-pixel object, copy its color value c, from input grid to output grid.\n    *    If c is present in the top row of the input, replace color of pixel directly above the top-most and leftmost azure object pixel with c.\n    *    If c is at a location other than the top row, copy it at position left of the top-most and left-most azure pixel of its respective row.\n5. If an input color c exists at multiple non-top row locations, create additional copies adjacent to the top-most and left-most pixel of the azure object.\n\nThe key idea is that, for certain colors, the transformation moves and duplicates certain colored pixels, while keeping azure pixels, and performing a replacement based on top row presence.\n"
