Identify adjacent 8 pixels. For the pixels identified find the closest adjacent 8's.\n4.  **Propagate/Mirror Colors**: Working from left to right, top to bottom. If an isolated pixel has a value different than 8, it will mirror its value to the adjacent 8 on its right, and the isolated pixel above will mirror to the 8 pixel below. If an isolated pixel of color is adjacent to an '8' along the shape's diagonal corners, it is assigned the value of the isolated color pixel.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_blob(grid, color):\n    # Find the largest contiguous region of a specific color.\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    visited = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=bool)\n    max_blob = []\n\n    def dfs(r, c, current_blob):\n        if (r < 0 or r >= rows or c < 0 or c >= cols or\n                visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] != color):\n            return\n        visited[r, c] = True\n        current_blob.append((r, c))\n        dfs(r + 1, c, current_blob)\n        dfs(r - 1, c, current_blob)\n        dfs(r, c + 1, current_blob)\n        dfs(r, c - 1, current_blob)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and not visited[r, c]:\n                current_blob = []\n                dfs(r, c, current_blob)\n                if len(current_blob) > len(max_blob):\n                    max_blob = current_blob\n    return max_blob\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, r, c):\n    # Get valid neighbors' coordinates and colors\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (1,1), (-1,-1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)]:\n        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbors.append((nr, nc, grid[nr, nc]))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef find_isolated_pixels(grid):\n   # Find single pixels of a different color surrounding the main blob.\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    isolated_pixels = []\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n             if grid[r,c] != 0 and grid[r,c] != 8:\n                neighbors = get_neighbors(grid,r,c)\n                count = 0\n                for nr, nc, color in neighbors:\n                    if color != 0 and color != 8:\n                        count +=1\n                \n                if count <= 2:\n                    isolated_pixels.append((r,c,grid[r,c]))\n\n    return isolated_pixels\n\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find the azure (8) blob\n    azure_blob = find_blob(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # find isolated surrounding pixels\n    isolated_pixels = find_isolated_pixels(input_grid)\n    \n    # Create a set for quick lookup of blob coordinates\n    blob_coords = set(azure_blob)\n\n    # Iterate through isolated pixels\n    for r, c, color in isolated_pixels:\n        neighbors = get_neighbors(input_grid, r, c)\n\n        for nr, nc, ncolor in neighbors:\n          #propagate color to right\n          if nr == r and nc == (c + 1) and (nr,nc) in blob_coords:\n              output_grid[nr,nc] = color\n\n          #propagate color below\n          if nr == (r+1) and nc == c and (nr,nc) in blob_coords:\n              output_grid[nr,nc] = color\n          \n          #propagate color on the corners\n          if (abs(nr-r) + abs(nc - c)) == 2 and (nr, nc) in blob_coords:\n              output_grid[nr,nc] = color\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
