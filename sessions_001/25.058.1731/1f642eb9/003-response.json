The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  There are several distinct colored regions in the input: a maroon (9) pixel, an azure (8) 3x2 block, a magenta (6) pixel, and a yellow (4) pixel. The output seems to preserve some, modify some, and remove some of these elements.  Specifically, the azure block seems to mostly stay the same, with a slight shift in the top left corner. The other colors change positions, and are maybe overwritten.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
