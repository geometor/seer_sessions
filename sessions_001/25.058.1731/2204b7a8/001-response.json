The input grids appear to have specific colored borders (top and bottom rows) and scattered single-colored pixels within the grid. The output grids maintain the border colors and transform the scattered interior pixels. The transformation seems to involve changing the color of the scattered interior pixels to match the color of the top border if above the main diagonal, and to the color of the bottom border if below the main diagonal.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These are the \"target colors.\"\n2.  **Iterate Interior Pixels:** For each pixel in the input grid that is *not* in the top or bottom row:\n3.  **Check Diagonal Relationship:**\n    *   If the pixel's row index is less than its column index (above the main diagonal), change its color to the top border color.\n    *   If the pixel's row index is greater than its column index (below the main diagonal), change its color to the bottom border color.\n    *    If on the main diagonal, leave its original color.\n4. **Preserve Borders:** The top and bottom rows of the grid remain unchanged.\n\nIn essence, the rule uses the main diagonal of the grid as a dividing line. Scattered pixels above the diagonal adopt the top border's color, and those below adopt the bottom border's color. The border colors themselves are copied without modification. Pixels which lay exactly on the main diagonal will also not be changed.\n"
