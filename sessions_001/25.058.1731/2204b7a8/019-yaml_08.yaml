facts:
  - observation: |
      The transformation rule depends on the row index of green (3) colored pixels.
  - property: grid_size: |
      The height of the grid (number of rows) determines how the rule is applied.
  - property: pixel_color: |
     Only Green (3) pixels are modified.
  - action: top_half_replacement: |
      Green pixels in the top half of the grid are replaced with azure (8).
      The top half is defined as rows with index strictly less than `(rows + 1) // 2`.
  - action: bottom_half_replacement: |
      Green pixels in the bottom half of the grid, including the middle row for grids with an odd number of rows, are replaced with maroon (9).
      The bottom half is defined as rows with index greater than or equal to `(rows + 1) // 2`.
  - constraint: other_pixels_unchanged: |
      Pixels that are not green remain unchanged in the output grid.
