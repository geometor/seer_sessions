Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   The input grid has vertical bars of blue (1) on the left and red (2) on the right. It has a few green (3) pixels.
*   The output grid maintains most of the structure of the input grid, but the green (3) pixels are replaced by blue (1).

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 10
      values: integers (0-9)

  - name: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
        color:
          0: white
          1: blue
          2: red
          3: green

actions:
    - name: replace_color
      input:
        - object: pixel
          property: color
          value: 3
      output:
        - object: pixel
          property: color
          value: 1

  - type: spatial

  - type: transformation
    description: "Input grid transforms to output grid by replacing specific colored pixels"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

The program takes a 10x10 grid as input. It iterates through each pixel of the grid. If a pixel's color is green (3), it changes the pixel's color to blue (1). All other pixels remain unchanged. The program outputs the modified grid.
