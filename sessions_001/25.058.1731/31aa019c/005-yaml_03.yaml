facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain one or more colored objects, possibly disconnected.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always a white background.
  - observation: |
      A 3x3 red square with a yellow center replaces the input objects.
  - observation: |
      The position of the 3x3 square is related to the position(s) of the object(s) in the input. It can be the combined center or biased to one of them.
  - action: Find all non-white pixels in the input.
  - action: Calculate a position related to all non-white pixels. It may be close to the center of the bounding box of all non-white pixels, but needs further refinements, especially with multiple, disconnected, and/or different sized objects.
  - action: Create a 3x3 red square.
  - action: Change the center pixel of the square to yellow.
  - action: create a white output grid, place the 3x3 block.
