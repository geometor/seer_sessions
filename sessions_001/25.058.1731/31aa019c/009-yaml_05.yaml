objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: determined by integer value (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: simplification
    description: Most pixels are set to 0.
  - type: selection
    description: a 3x3 block is copied.
  - type: recolor
    description: all selected pixels are assigned color 2, except for the center pixel.
  - type: center_recolor

relationships:
  - input_grid: Contains many colored pixels.
  - output_grid: Contains mostly 0s, with a small colored block.
  - spatial_correspondence: The non-zero region in the output relates to the position of colors in a section of the input.
