The output is also a 10x10 grid, but it mostly contains 0s (white), with a small 3x3 block of 2s (red) and a single 6 (magenta) pixel in the center. The output seems to be a highly simplified or filtered version of the input. The position of non-zero pixels in output seems to correspond to a cluster of non-zero pixels in upper right quadrant of the input.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
