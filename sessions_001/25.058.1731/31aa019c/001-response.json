The input grids have various single-pixel colors scattered across the grid. The output grids seem to be mostly empty (white, color 0), except for a concentrated area of red (color 2) pixels, sometimes containing a single different colored pixel inside. The location and size of this red area seems related to the distribution of colors in the input.  It looks like the output isolates and transforms a specific region of the input grid based on color. The key seems to be identifying a non-white color cluster, replacing all but one pixel in the cluster with red(2), keeping one of the original colored pixels, and clearing all other pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
