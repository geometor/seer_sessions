Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), azure (8), and green (3). The transformation appears to maintain the overall structure of the grid, with a focus on modifying a specific object within the grid. The most noticeable change is within the azure (8) colored regions, parts of which get replaced by green(3) color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: 17
      - height: 17
      - cells: integers (0-9)
  - name: azure_region
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 8 (azure)
      - shape: irregular, contiguous
  - name: green_region
    type: object
    properties:
      - color: 3 (green)
      - shape: irregular, contiguous

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    description: Replaces a part of azure region with the color green.
    parameters:
      - from_color: 8
      - to_color: 3
    constraints:
      - within: azure_region

relationships:
   - type: part_of
     from: azure_region
     to: grid
   - type: part_of
     from: green_region
     to: grid
   - type: becomes
     from: azure_region
     to: green_region+azure_region

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Azure Region:** Locate the contiguous block of pixels with the color azure (8).
2.  **Inner object change:** The inner object of 3x3 azure pixels is replaced by green color (3).
3.  All other objects and regions are preserved.

In simpler terms, a sub-part of the azure region is replaced by green, other cells are unchanged. The replaced parts are interior to the Azure objects.
