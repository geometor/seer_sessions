The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and azure (8). In the output, a new color, green (3), appears to be replacing some of the blue (1) pixels adjacent to the azure (8) pixels. The transformation seems to focus on the interaction between blue and azure regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
