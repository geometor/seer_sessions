The grids contain pixels of values representing colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 5 (gray). There are two distinct objects based on color: blue (1) objects and gray (5) objects. The input grids consistently have a row of gray pixels at the bottom, and blue pixels above them. The output seems to be a rearrangement of these objects. The blue pixels in input are somehow repositioned at bottom with the grey pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
