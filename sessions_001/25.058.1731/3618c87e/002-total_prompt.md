**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids. The grids contain pixels of values representing colors: 0 (white), 1 (blue), and 5 (gray). There are two distinct objects based on color: blue (1) objects and gray (5) objects. The input grids consistently have a row of gray pixels at the bottom, and blue pixels above them. The output seems to be a rearrangement of these objects. The blue pixels in input are somehow repositioned at bottom with the grey pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: blue (1)
    initial_position: variable, above gray pixels
    final_position: bottom row, replacing gray pixels
  - name: gray_pixel
    color: gray (5)
    initial_position: bottom row, and sometimes above the bottom row
    final_position: bottom row, and the row above, except where replaced by blue pixels

actions:
  - name: move_blue
    description: Blue pixels move to the bottom row.
  - name: replace_gray
    description: Blue pixels replace gray pixels in the bottom row.
  - name: shift_grey
    description: grey pixels are moved 1 position upwards

relationships:
  - spatial: Blue pixels are initially located above gray pixels.
  - positional: the number of grey pixels from column `i` that get moved to the upper row is `number_of_grey_in_col - number_of_blue_in_col`
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all blue (1) pixels and gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Iterate** through each column of the input grid.
3.  **Count** number of the blue and grey pixels in current column
4.  **Move** blue pixels to their new location on last row. The original blue pixel locations are filled with 0.
5. **Move** grey pixels: original locations of the grey pixels on last row will be filled with blue according to rule in point 4, all other grey locations remain intact.
6. **Fill** the position above each moved gray pixel's original location with grey.

In essence, the blue pixels in each column are moved to the bottom row, replacing the gray pixels in the bottom row. Any gray pixels displaced by blue move up one position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
