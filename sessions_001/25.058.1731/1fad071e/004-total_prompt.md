```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=576x576 at 0x7C360455CBD0>

**output:**
```
1 1 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x64 at 0x7C36039E5BD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 9x9 grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output is a 1x5 grid, also of single-digit integers, which seem to be a highly compressed summary of the input. The significant reduction in size and change in shape is the primary characteristic of the transformation. Colors (represented by digits) present in the input are also present in the output, although frequency seems significantly altered. There seems to be a preference for outputting color values found on the edges or corners of shapes within the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x5
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - name: blue_regions
    type: object_group
    color: 1  # Blue
    shape: variable #irregular
  - name: red_regions
    type: object_group
    color: 2
  - name: white_regions
    type: object_group
    color: 0

actions:
  - type: counting
    target: colored regions
    properties: [color, occurrences]
  - type: selection
    target: specific colors for output
  - type: compression/resizing
    target: from 9x9 input to 1x5 output

relationships:
   - input_grid_contains: [blue_regions, red_regions, white_regions]
   - output_grid_represents: compressed_summary_of(input_grid)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine Input Grid:** Analyze the input grid (9x9) and identify all distinct colored regions. Note the colors present and potentially their positions.
2.  **Prioritize Colors/Counts** Count or list the colors on the first and last rows and the first and last columns.
3.  **Construct Output**: generate the output grid by composing a sequence of color values. Specifically, the colors in the output appear to be colors from the top and/or bottom rows, prioritizing the first occurrence.
4. **Output Dimensions**: create a new grid of 1x5 dimension and populate it with the color sequence.

In summary, it takes values from the first and last row to output the values in the order they are found from left to right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
