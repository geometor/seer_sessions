example_1:
  input:
    object_type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    border_color: 3
    inner_color: 0
    unique_colors: [3, 0]
  output:
    object_type: grid
    dimensions: 1x2
    colors: [3, 0]
  transformation:
    rule: "Extract unique colors from the input grid's first and last rows, then create a 1xN grid where N is the number of those unique colors"

example_2:
  input:
    object_type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    border_color: 8
    inner_colors: [0, 5, 2]
    unique_colors: [8, 0, 5, 2]
  output:
    object_type: grid
    dimensions: 1x4
    colors: [8, 0, 5, 2]
  transformation:
     rule: "Extract unique colors present in the entire grid, and create a 1xN grid to represent those"

example_3:
  input:
    object_type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    border_color: 1
    inner_colors: [0, 4, 3, 7]
    unique_colors: [1, 0, 4, 3, 7]

  output:
    object_type: grid
    dimensions: 1x5
    colors: [1, 0, 4, 3, 7]
  transformation:
    rule: "Extract unique colors present in the entire input grid, and create a 1xN grid to represent those"
