The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0-9, though only 0, 1, and 2 are present in these examples). The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. The most prominent colors in the input are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The output consistently contains blue (1) and white (0). This suggests a summarization or filtering process based on color. The number of blues are variable per row in the input and in the examples provided.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
