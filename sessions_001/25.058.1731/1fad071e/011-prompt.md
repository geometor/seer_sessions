Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1. Identify Blue Pixels: Locate all pixels with the value '1' (blue) in the input grid.
2. Count Blue Regions: Count the blue regions. If you view the blue pixels as connected to blue pixels that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of the blue pixel, the blue pixel form four distinct, not connected, regions.
3. Create Output: Generate a 1x5 grid. Place four blue pixels in a row followed by a single white pixel.

In essence, the transformation extracts and counts the disconnected regions of blue and represents it as a series of blue pixels, followed by a white pixel.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
