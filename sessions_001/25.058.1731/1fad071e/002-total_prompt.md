**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids as input, and the output appears to be a 1D array (a single row). The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0-9, though only 0, 1, and 2 are present in these examples). The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids. The most prominent colors in the input are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The output consistently contains blue (1) and white (0). This suggests a summarization or filtering process based on color. The number of blues are variable per row in the input and in the examples provided.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, red]
      - shape: variable (e.g., 9x9)
    actions: []
  - object: output_grid
    type: 1D array
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue]
      - shape: fixed width (5)
    actions: []
  - relationship: input_to_output
    type: transformation
    description: "The input grid is transformed into a smaller 1D output grid."
    rules:
      - "Count blue pixels in each input row"
      - if count > 0 then place blue pixel in output
      - add white pixels to make output of length 5
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  For each row, **count** the number of blue (value 1) pixels.
3. If the blue pixel count is > 0, then add 1 to the output array.
4. continue for all rows
5. the length of the output array must be 5, if the array is less than 5, append white pixels (0) until it is 5

In essence, the transformation extracts a summary of the presence of blue pixels (color 1) in each row of the input grid. If a row in input grid has a blue pixel, it will have one in the output array. Fill rest of the array with white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
