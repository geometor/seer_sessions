Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 9x9 grid containing pixels of different colors (represented by integers 0-9). The output is a 1x5 grid. The output seems to be a drastically simplified representation of the input, focusing on specific colors and their arrangement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x5
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      colors: [0, 1]     # white, blue

actions:
    - name: extract
      description: Extracts a subset of information from the input grid.
      input: input_grid
      output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: simplification
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    description: The output_grid is a simplified, extracted representation of the input_grid.

  - type: color_focus
      description: only includes blue(1) and white(0) in output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '1' (blue) in the input grid.
2.  **Count Blue Regions:** Count the blue regions. If you view the blue pixels as connected to blue pixels that are to the left, right, top, or bottom of the blue pixel, the blue pixel form four distinct, not connected, regions.
3. **Create Output:** Generate a 1x5 grid. Place four blue pixels in a row followed by a single white pixel.

In essence, the transformation extracts and counts the disconnected regions of blue and represents it as a series of blue pixels, followed by a white pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
