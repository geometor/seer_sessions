Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation creates a 1xN output grid, where N is determined by the presence and count of uniform color blocks in the input. If the input consists of only 2x2 blue blocks, the output is a 1xN grid of 1s, where N is the number of 2x2 blue blocks. If input consists of all the same non-blue colors, the output is just [[0]]. If the bottom row has any non-blue that is the same as its neighbor, it is ignored.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
