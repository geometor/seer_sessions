Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 9x9 grid containing colored pixels. The colors present are red (2), blue (1), and white (0). The output is a 1x5 grid, containing only blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output appears to be a highly compressed representation of some aspect of the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_type: grid
  - input_dimensions: 9x9
  - input_colors: [red, blue, white]
  - output_type: grid
  - output_dimensions: 1x5
  - output_colors: [blue, white]
  - objects:
      - type: pixel
        properties:
          color: [red, blue, white]
      - type: grid
        properties:
          dimensions: [9x9, 1x5]

  - actions:
      - type: compression/counting/selection #still uncertain of exact action
        description: select a feature from the input to create a new grid in output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe** the input grid. It is made of pixels, each of a color from the set 0, 1, and 2.
2.  **Count** the number of 2x2 blocks, where each of the four pixels are of a color from this set, and all four are the same color.
3.  Iterate over all possible 2x2 sections of input.
4.  Create the output grid from counted 2x2 blocks, the length of count.
5. Output is the count of each color as a grid of 1's and 0
    - Blue (1) squares counted result in 1
    - Rest counted are 0.

The transformation appears to count specific arrangements of color squares and represent the counts in the output with 1s for blue counts and 0s for rest.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
