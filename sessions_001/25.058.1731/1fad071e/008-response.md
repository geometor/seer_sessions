The transformation rule involves identifying the single unique color present in the input grid and creating a 1x1 output grid containing that color.

1. Find Unique Color: Identify the unique color value present in the input grid. Since all training examples show only one color, we can simply take the color of the first pixel.
2. Create Output Grid: Create a 1x1 output grid.
3. Populate Output: Set the value of the single cell in the output grid to the unique color found in step 1.

    unique_color = input_grid[0][0]

    # Create a 1x1 output grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros((1, 1), dtype=int)

    # Set the value of the output grid to the unique color.
    output_grid[0, 0] = unique_color
