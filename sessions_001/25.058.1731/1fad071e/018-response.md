"""
The transformation creates a 1xN output grid, where N is determined by the presence and count of uniform color blocks in the input. If the input consists of only 2x2 blue blocks, the output is a 1xN grid of 1s, where N is the number of 2x2 blue blocks. If input consists of all the same non-blue colors, the output is just [[0]]. If the bottom row has any non-blue that is the same as its neighbor, it is ignored.
