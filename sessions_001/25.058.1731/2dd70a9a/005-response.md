Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code focused on expanding green pixels into adjacent white pixels, but only within regions *not* fully enclosed by azure pixels. The "not fully enclosed" condition was implemented by checking if any azure pixel was on the edge of the grid. This approach has limitations, as demonstrated by the test results.  Specifically, the initial implementation doesn't correctly handle cases where the azure region is not fully enclosed, but the simple edge check fails (e.g. azure area is in a donut shape).

The main issue is the `is_fully_enclosed` function. It incorrectly identifies some azure regions as enclosed when they are not, preventing the green expansion.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Improve Enclosure Detection:** Replace the simplistic edge-check with a flood-fill algorithm, starting from the edges of the grid, to properly determine if an azure region is fully enclosed.

2.  **Clarify Expansion Rules:** Ensure that the expansion continues as long as green pixels have adjacent white pixels *within the non-enclosed azure regions*.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To provide accurate metrics, I need the input and output grids. Since I don't have the capability to execute code directly, I'll hypothetically analyze the outputs based on a visual inspection if the grids were provided.

For the provided example inputs and outputs, I will assume that they are displayed in a human readable format (using 0-9 digits to represent the colors).

**Example Metrics (Hypothetical, based on visual analysis if grids were shown):**

| Example | Input Grid Size | Output Grid Size | Initial `is_fully_enclosed` Result | Correct `is_fully_enclosed` Result | Green Expansion Correct? | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | (e.g., 10x10)   | (e.g., 10x10)    | (e.g., False)                    | (e.g., False)                     | (e.g., Yes)              | (Example used to derive initial program - assumed to be correct, although we know the `is_fully_enclosed` could be wrong if the grid happened to have azure all around the edges.)                                            |
| 2       | (e.g., 12x12)   | (e.g., 12x12)    | (e.g., True)                     | (e.g., False)                     | (e.g., No)               | (Illustrates a case where the azure region is NOT fully enclosed, but the initial implementation incorrectly identifies it as enclosed because some azure pixels are on the border. The green expansion does not occur as it should.) |
| 3       | (e.g., 8x8)     | (e.g., 8x8)      | (e.g., True)                   | (e.g., True)                    | (e.g., Yes)             | (The azure area IS fully enclosed, therefore no expansion of green is expected or performed - a correct result.)                                                                             |
| ...     | ...             | ...              | ...                               | ...                                  | ...                       | ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

  - name: expand_green
    description:  Green pixels expand into adjacent white pixels within non-enclosed azure regions.
    preconditions:
      - azure_region.enclosed == False
      - A green pixel is next to a white pixel.
    postconditions:
      - Green pixels replace adjacent white pixels.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels.

2.  **Determine Enclosure Status:** For each azure region, use a flood-fill algorithm, starting from any pixels on the very edge of the grid to any connected white(0) pixels. If no pixels in an azure region are connected by white(0) pixels to the edge, the azure region is considered "fully enclosed".

3.  **Expand Green:** In non-enclosed azure areas, identify green (3) pixels. If a green pixel is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a white (0) pixel, change the white pixel to green.

4.  **Iterate Expansion:** Repeat step 3 until no more green pixels can expand into adjacent white pixels within the non-enclosed azure regions.
