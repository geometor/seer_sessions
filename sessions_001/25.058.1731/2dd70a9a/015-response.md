Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value (represented by integers 0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), green (3), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve a selective "filling" operation, where certain colored objects are expanded based on adjacency. The azure (8) pixels seem to act like fixed boundaries in most cases, and green 3 and Red 2 may be the object that is to be filled/expanded.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - green (3)
        - red (2)
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [15, 15]

actions:
  - name: fill
    description: Extends a colored region horizontally.
    constraints:
      - Stops at azure (8) pixels.
      - Only affects green(3) and red(2)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent if they share a side (not diagonally).
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Objects:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (3) and red (2) pixels.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each target object (green and red regions), expand the region horizontally to the left and right.
3.  **Boundary Condition:** Stop the expansion when an azure (8) pixel or the edge of the grid is encountered.
4. **Green and red objects do not expand past each other**: The first object encountered will stop the other from expanding beyond it.

In essence, the green and red regions "grow" horizontally until they hit an azure wall or the edge of the input.
