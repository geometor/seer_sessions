<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2960x2610 at 0x7C360BFEB350>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing pixels of various colors (represented by integers 0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), green (3), and red (2).  The most prominent change appears to be related to the green (3) pixels.  Azure (8) pixels seem largely unchanged, while red (2) and white (0) have very localized changes. It seems that green (3) objects are expanding, under certain constraints. The position of green (3) and red (2) may hold the key.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_object
    color: 3
    type: contiguous_block
    behavior: expands

  - id: azure_object
    color: 8
    type: contiguous_block
    behavior: static

  - id: red_object
    color: 2
    type: single_pixel
    behavior: static, possibly_acts_as_seed

  - id: white_object
    color: 0
    type: background
    behavior: passive, replaced_by_green

relationships:
  - green_object expands adjacent to azure_object, until green meets a red color or another green.
  - green_object expands from seed_point which is nearest a red.
  - red_object does not change.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Points:** Find all green (3) pixels in the input grid. Also, Identify the red (2) pixel.
2.  **Green Expansion:** Starting from the green pixels closest to red, iteratively expand the green (3) color to adjacent white (0) pixels. The growth of green is limited by azure, red, and other green pixels.
3.  **Azure Preservation:** Azure (8) pixels remain unchanged throughout the transformation.
4.  **Red Preservation:** Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.

In simple terms, green expands from existing green pixels that are closest to the red pixel. Green replaces white and stops at azure or red, or itself.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
