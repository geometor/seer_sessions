Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a downward shift of specific colored pixels (1, 2, and 4) if the pixel directly above is white (0). The test results indicate that this rule is partially correct but needs refinement. Specifically, the swapping logic appears to be too simplistic; multiple pixels will swap with the same white pixel, which is not shown in the example. Instead, it is likely to be an 'empty' space swap that pulls values down. We need to revise this logic to move colors down appropriately.

**Metrics and Observations**
Here's a breakdown of each example, along with observations from comparing input, expected output and actual output:

Since it is difficult to compare the grids visually, I will focus on the changed pixels between actual and expected.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def get_pixels_by_color(grid, colors):
    """
    Finds the coordinates of pixels with specified colors.

    Args:
        grid: The input grid (2D numpy array).
        colors: A list of colors (integers) to search for.

    Returns:
        A list of (row, col) tuples representing the coordinates of the pixels.
    """
    pixels = []
    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[r, c] in colors:
                pixels.append((r, c))
    return pixels

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """
    Compares two grids and returns the coordinates and values where they differ.

    Args:
        grid1: The first grid (2D numpy array).
        grid2: The second grid (2D numpy array).

    Returns:
        A list of tuples: (row, col, value_in_grid1, value_in_grid2)

                differences.append((r, c, grid1[r, c], grid2[r, c]))
