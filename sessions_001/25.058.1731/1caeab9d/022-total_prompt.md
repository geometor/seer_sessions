Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a downward shift of specific colored pixels (1, 2, and 4) if the pixel directly above is white (0). The test results indicate that this rule is partially correct but needs refinement. Specifically, the swapping logic appears to be too simplistic; multiple pixels will swap with the same white pixel, which is not shown in the example. Instead, it is likely to be an 'empty' space swap that pulls values down. We need to revise this logic to move colors down appropriately.

**Metrics and Observations**
Here's a breakdown of each example, along with observations from comparing input, expected output and actual output:

Since it is difficult to compare the grids visually, I will focus on the changed pixels between actual and expected.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
