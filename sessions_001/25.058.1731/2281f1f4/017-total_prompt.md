Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the "border":** Locate all '5' (gray) pixels along the top and right edges of the input grid.
2.  **Infill:** For each gray pixel identified, change the color value to a '2' (red) of the pixel that is one step diagonally inward (down and to the left). If the gray pixel is at `(row, col)`, infill the pixel `(row + 1, col - 1)` with red, as long as `row + 1` and `col -1` is still within the grid.
3. Gray pixels remain.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by creating an inner red border based on the gray border.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])

    # Iterate through the grid to find gray border pixels
    for row in range(rows):
        for col in range(cols):
            if input_grid[row][col] == 5:
                # Check if it's on the top or right edge
                if row == 0 or col == cols - 1:
                    # Infill diagonally inward with red (if within bounds)
                    if row + 1 < rows and col - 1 >= 0:

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
