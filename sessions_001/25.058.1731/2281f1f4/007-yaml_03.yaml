      Gray pixels act as influencers, determining which white pixels will change color.  The transformation of white pixels to red is dependent on their position relative to the gray pixels.

      - name: pixel
        properties:
          - color: integer (0-9)
          - position: (row, column)
  - actions:
      - name: change_color
        agent: gray pixel
        target: white pixel
        condition: |
            A white pixel changes to red if it shares *either* its row *or* its column with *any* gray pixel. It's an inclusive OR.  If a white pixel is in *both* a row and a column containing a gray pixel, it still turns red.
