  output_objects:
    - object_4: {shape: line, color: mixed, pixels: [[2,0], [2,1], [2,2]]}
  transformation: "Non-zero pixels are extracted, sorted by row, and placed in the last row of the output."

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {shape: rectangle, color: blue, pixels: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]}

    - object_4: {shape: rectangle, color: white, pixels: [[0,3],[1,3]]}
  transformation: "Black pixels are changed to white."

example_3:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {shape: L, color: green, pixels: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0], [2,1]]}
  output_objects:
    - object_2: {shape: L, color: green, pixels: [[1,0], [2,0], [3,0], [3,1]]}
  transformation: "The green L shape is moved down by one row."
