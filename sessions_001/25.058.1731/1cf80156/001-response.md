Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids as input and output. The grids contain single-digit integers representing different colors. The input grids are larger (12x10 or 12x11) and contain a single connected shape/object of a non-zero color, surrounded by zeros. The output grids are smaller and appear to be a cropped, potentially rotated, version of the input grid, containing only the non-zero colored object.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 12 x (10 or 11)
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, smaller than input_grid
      - values: integers (0-9)
  - name: colored_object
    type: connected component
    properties:
       - color: non-zero integer
       - shape: irregular

actions:
  - name: extract_object
    description: Isolates the non-zero colored object from the input grid.
  - name: crop
    description: Removes the surrounding zeros to create a minimal bounding box around the object
  - name: rotate
    description: possible rotation

relationships:
  - input_grid contains colored_object
  - output_grid is a transformed version of colored_object
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the colored object:** Locate the contiguous block of non-zero pixels within the input grid. This defines the region of interest.
2. **Extract the bounding box:** Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices that enclose the colored object. This defines a rectangular subgrid.
3. **Create the output grid** Create new grid from the bounding box.

Let's walk through the examples and make sure the natural language steps are correct.
