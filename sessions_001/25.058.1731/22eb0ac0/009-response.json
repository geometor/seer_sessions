The transformation seems to selectively fill certain rows based on the presence of non-zero values in the input grid. Specifically, only horizontal lines containing non-zero numbers at the borders get filled with the value of the border number. The interior numbers remain in place as before, unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

All the numbers in the borders are the same in each horizontal line.\n4. **Preserve other numbers**: the pixels that are not on a horizontal line at the edges are not modified.\n5. **Other Rows:** Rows that don't meet the border criteria remain unchanged and all other pixels maintain the values as it is.\n\nEssentially, the transformation identifies and \"fills\" specific rows based on a simple edge condition. The non zero values in the grid that are not on the edges are kept where they are.\n"
