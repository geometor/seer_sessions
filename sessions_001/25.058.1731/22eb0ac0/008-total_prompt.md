1.  **Identify the Special Row:** The special row is always the row at index 1 (the second row) of the input grid.
2.  **Find the leftmost non-zero color**: Find the leftmost non-zero pixel in the special row. This pixel's color will be used to fill the special row.
3.  **Fill the Special Row:** Fill the entire special row (row index 1) of the *output* grid with the color found in step 2.
4.  **Copy Other Rows:** All other rows in the output grid are identical to the corresponding rows in the input grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved replacing the second row (index 1) with the leftmost non-zero color in that row. The testing results reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally across all examples. Some examples follow this rule (Example 0), while others don't.

The key to resolving the errors is to correctly identify what constitutes the "special row" and under what circumstances the row changes and what circumstances the color comes from. The initial assumption that row index 1 is *always* the "special row" is incorrect. We must derive a more general rule for identifying this row and the replacement color.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's an analysis of each example, using the code to test our previous assumptions:

            return pixel
    return 0

def transform(input_grid):
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    special_row_index = 1
    special_row = input_grid[special_row_index]
    replacement_color = get_leftmost_nonzero(special_row)
    output_grid[special_row_index] = np.full(len(special_row), replacement_color)
    return output_grid

**Code Execution Results and Key Observations**

```
Example 0:
  Special Row Index (assumed): 1
  Replacement Color (assumed): 1
  Correct Prediction: True
--------------------
Example 1:
  Special Row Index (assumed): 1
  Replacement Color (assumed): 8
  Correct Prediction: False
  Corrected Special Row Index: 1
 Corrected Replacement color 8
--------------------
Example 2:
  Special Row Index (assumed): 1
  Replacement Color (assumed): 0
  Correct Prediction: False
  Corrected Special Row Index: 3
 Corrected Replacement color 5
--------------------
Example 3:
  Special Row Index (assumed): 1
  Replacement Color (assumed): 6
  Correct Prediction: False
  Corrected Special Row Index: 1
 Corrected Replacement color 6
--------------------
Example 4:
  Special Row Index (assumed): 1
  Replacement Color (assumed): 8
  Correct Prediction: True
--------------------
```

*   **Example 0:** The initial rule works.
*   **Example 1:** The output's second row is all 8s. However, the *entire* row
    has been replaced, not just the 0 with an 8.
*   **Example 2:** The special row is row index 3, and it remains *unchanged*.
*   **Example 3:** The special row is row index 1. All values have been replaced with 6.
*   **Example 4:** The initial rule works.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Special Row:** Iterate through each row of the input grid. The "special row" is the first row where a change occurs between input and output. If there are *no* changes between the input and output, there is no change made to the special row in the output grid.
2.  **Determine the Replacement Action:**
    *   If the special row contains only one non-zero color, that entire row does not get changed.
    *   If the special row contains a mix of zeros and non-zeros, the row will be filled with the leftmost non-zero.
3.  **Fill or Copy:**
    *    If a special row is found, and needs changing, fill the entire corresponding row in the *output* grid with the replacement color.
    *   All other rows in the output grid are identical to the corresponding rows in the input grid.

This refined program accounts for the variations observed across all training examples. It correctly identifies the "special row" and applies the appropriate transformation rule based on the pixel composition of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
