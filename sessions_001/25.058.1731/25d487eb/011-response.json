The primary colors involved are white (0), azure (8), and green (3). The input grid contains an \"arrowhead\" or \"triangle\" shape composed of azure (8) pixels, with a single green (3) pixel at its base, all surrounded by white (0) pixels.  The output grid is identical to the input except with 5 green (3) pixels in a vertical line segment starting above the arrowhead.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
