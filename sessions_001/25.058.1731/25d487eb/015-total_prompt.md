Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Find the Green Pixel:** Locate the single green (3) pixel in the input grid. Record its column.
2.  **Draw Vertical Line:** In the output grid, create a vertical line of green (3) pixels.
3.  **Starting Point:** The line starts at the top of the grid (row 0) in the same column as the green pixel found in step 1.
4.  **Line Length:** Examine input grid. Extend the green line downwards.
5. **Stopping Condition:** If there is a non-white pixel in any lower row, in the same column, stop the green line one row *above* the row where the non-white object was detected. If there is no non-white pixel, stop when at the bottom of the grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
