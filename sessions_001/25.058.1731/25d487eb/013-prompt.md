Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to identify an "arrowhead" shape made of azure (8) pixels with a green (3) pixel at its base. Then a vertical line of green (3) pixels is added, starting from the top row of the grid and extending downwards for 5 pixels, aligned with the column of the green base pixel of the arrowhead.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_arrowhead_base(grid):
    # Find the green pixel (3)
    rows, cols = np.where(grid == 3)
    if len(rows) > 0:
        return rows[0], cols[0]  # Assuming only one green pixel
    return None

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the base of the arrowhead (green pixel)
    base_coords = find_arrowhead_base(input_grid)

    if base_coords:
        _, base_col = base_coords

        # Draw the vertical green line
        for row in range(5):
            output_grid[row, base_col] = 3

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
