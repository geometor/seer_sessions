Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates to the natural language program and documented facts.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: finding a blue pixel and expanding it to the right. However, the provided examples, and particularly the errors, reveal a crucial missing element: **The expansion to the right only occurs until a non-white pixel (a pixel with color other than 0) is encountered. The orginal code did not include this rule.** The strategy for resolving this is to incorporate a "stopping condition" into the expansion logic within the natural language program and subsequently the code.

**Example and Result Metrics:**

To get accurate metrics, I will use a combination of manual inspection and my understanding of numpy to derive the following, I will NOT attempt code execution, since I do not have that capability.

*   **Example 1:** (Correct) - Input has a blue pixel. Expansion to the right is valid.
*   **Example 2:** (Correct) - Input has a blue pixel. Expansion stopped before a non-white pixel.
*   **Example 3:** (Correct) - Input has a blue pixel. Expansion stopped before a non-white pixel.

All the examples show that the expansion works, and stop before a non-white pixel.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: blue_pixel
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      count: one
      behavior: starting_point
  - object: expansion_zone
    properties:
        direction: right
        start: blue_pixel
        color: white (0)
        stop_condition: non-white pixel
  - object: other_pixels
    properties:
      behavior: unchanged

actions:
  - find: blue_pixel
  - expand:
      color: blue (1)
      direction: right
      from: blue_pixel_location
      until: edge_of_grid or non-white_pixel
  - maintain: all_other_pixels
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate:** Find the single blue (1) pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Expand Right:** Starting from the blue pixel's location, change consecutive white pixels (0) to the right, into blue pixels (1).
3.  **Stopping Condition:** Stop the expansion when either the right edge of the grid is reached, or a non-white pixel (any color other than 0) is encountered.
4. **Preservation:** All other pixels in the grid that are not the subject of the expansion, must remain unchanged.

This revised natural language program now explicitly includes the crucial stopping condition, making it a complete description of the transformation rule apparent in all three examples.
