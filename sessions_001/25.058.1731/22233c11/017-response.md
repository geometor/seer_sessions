Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation rule to the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. The subsequent tests reveal inconsistencies. Specifically, the rule regarding the placement of azure pixels relative to green pixels needs adjustment. The initial rule assumed a fixed offset (+1 row, -2 columns and -1 row, +2 columns) for placing azure pixels. The additional examples demonstrate that this offset relationship is not universally applicable. It appears that the intention is that an Azure should be placed adjacent to the green, only when the green is at the very edge of an object.

The core strategy to address this will be:

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Focus on accurate identification of contiguous blocks of the same color as objects.
2.  **Contextualize Azure Placement:** Instead of fixed offsets, determine the placement of azure pixels based on a green pixel's adjacency to other colors within its object and the grid boundaries.
3. Keep zeroing out empty cells

**Metrics and Observations**

To precisely understand the patterns, let's analyze each example using code execution to gather metrics.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)
    predicted_grid = np.array(predicted_grid)

    green_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 3)
    azure_pixels_output = np.sum(output_grid == 8)
    green_pixels_predicted = np.sum(predicted_grid == 3)
    azure_pixels_predicted = np.sum(predicted_grid == 8)

    correct_green = np.sum((input_grid == 3) & (predicted_grid == 3))
    correct_azure = np.sum((output_grid == 8) & (predicted_grid == 8))
    incorrect_green = np.sum((input_grid != 3) & (predicted_grid == 3)) # predicted but should not
    incorrect_azure = np.sum((output_grid != 8) & (predicted_grid == 8)) # predicted but should not
    missing_green = np.sum((input_grid == 3) & (predicted_grid != 3))   # should, but not predicted
    missing_azure = np.sum((output_grid == 8) & (predicted_grid != 8)) # should, but not predicted

    print(f"Input Green Pixels: {green_pixels_input}")
    print(f"Output Azure Pixels: {azure_pixels_output}")
    print(f"Predicted Green Pixels: {green_pixels_predicted}")
    print(f"Predicted Azure Pixels: {azure_pixels_predicted}")
    print(f"Correct Green: {correct_green}")
    print(f"Correct Azure: {correct_azure}")
    print(f"Incorrect Green: {incorrect_green}")    
    print(f"Incorrect Azure: {incorrect_azure}")
    print(f"Missing Green: {missing_green}")    
    print(f"Missing Azure: {missing_azure}")    

    print("Input Grid:")
    print(input_grid)
    print("Output Grid:")
    print(output_grid)
    print("Predicted Grid:")
    print(predicted_grid)

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Locate all contiguous groups of green (value 3) pixels. Consider these as distinct objects.
2.  **Copy Green Objects:** Copy all identified green objects to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and shapes.
3.  **Place Azure Pixels (Conditional):** For each green object, examine only its edge pixels. An edge pixel is one that is directly adjacent (not diagonally) to a pixel of a different color or to the edge of the grid.
 * If an edge pixel on the object is touching the *top*, *bottom*, *left*, or *right* edge of the *grid*:
    * Place an azure pixel (value 8) adjacent to the green edge pixel, extending *outward* from the green object. The azure placement will always be:
      * To the *right* if the green edge pixel touches the *right* edge of the *grid*.
      * To the *left* if the green edge pixel touches the *left* edge of the *grid*.
      * *Above* if the green edge pixel touches the *top* edge of the *grid*.
      * *Below* if the green edge pixel touches the *bottom* edge of the *grid*.
4. **Zero Out**: Fill all remaining empty cells in the output_grid with 0.

This revised natural language program focuses on object boundaries and edge conditions for azure pixel placement, which is more consistent with all three examples.
