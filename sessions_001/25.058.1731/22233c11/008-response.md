"""
1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Locate all pixels colored green (value 3) in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Green Pixel Pairs:** Consider green pixels and their potential connections.
3.  **Check for Down-Right Diagonal Alignment and Square Formation Potential:** A pair of green pixels is eligible for connection if:
    *   One pixel is located down and to the right of the other.
    *   These pixels would form the diagonal of a complete or partially complete *square*, where other pixels belonging to the same group are found in locations to form a square.
4.  **Fill Diagonal with Azure:** If a pair of green pixels meets the criteria in Step 3, fill the diagonal line between them (inclusive of the end green pixels if needed to complete the square) with azure (value 8).
5.  **Ignore Isolated Green Pixels**: If other green pixels are not part of the discovered object, ignore them.
6.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the input grid retain their original colors in the output grid.
