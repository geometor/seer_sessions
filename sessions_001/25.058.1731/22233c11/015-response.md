Okay, let's analyze this input-output example to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The input grid contains mostly '0' (white) pixels, with two '3' (green) pixels.
*   The output grid also contains mostly '0' pixels, has the same two '3' (green) pixels in their original position, and introduces '8' (azure) pixels.
*   The location of the azure pixels seems related to the green. They appear on the diagonals, one row and two columns away.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_pixel_1
    color: green
    value: 3
    initial_position: [3, 3]
  - id: green_pixel_2
    color: green
    value: 3
    initial_position: [4, 4]
  - id: azure_pixel_1
    color: azure
    value: 8
    initial_position: [2, 5]
  - id: azure_pixel_2
    color: azure
    value: 8
    initial_position: [5, 2]

actions:
  - type: copy
    target: green_pixels
    description: Green pixels are copied from input to output.
  - type: create
    target: azure_pixels
    description: Azure pixels are created based on the position of green pixels.
    rule: "An azure pixel appear diagonally from the position of the green pixels, at one row and two columns away."

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     from: green_pixel_1, green_pixel_2
     to: azure_pixel_1, azure_pixel_2
     description: "Azure pixels are placed diagonally at one row and two cols of the green pixels"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Green Pixels:** Copy all pixels with the value '3' (green) from the input grid to the same positions in the output grid.

2.  **Place Azure Pixels Diagonally:** For each green pixel in the input grid, if an azure pixel can be placed at the following offsets, place an azure pixel in the output grid:
    *   +1 row, -2 column and -1 row, +2 columns.
    *  In other words, place an Azure pixel at one row and two cols, towards top-right and bottom-left corners, relative to the current green pixel, considering the origin as top-left.

3. **Fill empty cells with zeros** Fill the other cells of the output with 0.
