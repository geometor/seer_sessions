"""
1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Locate all contiguous groups of green (value 3) pixels. Consider these as distinct objects.
2.  **Copy Green Objects:** Copy all identified green objects to the output grid, maintaining their original positions and shapes.
3.  **Place Azure Pixels (Conditional):** For each green object, examine only its edge pixels. An edge pixel is one that is directly adjacent (not diagonally) to a pixel of a different color or to the edge of the grid.
    *   If an edge pixel on the object is touching the *top*, *bottom*, *left*, or *right* edge of the *grid*:
        *   Place an azure pixel (value 8) adjacent to the green edge pixel, extending *outward* from the green object. The azure placement will always be:
            *   To the *right* if the green edge pixel touches the *right* edge of the *grid*.
            *   To the *left* if the green edge pixel touches the *left* edge of the *grid*.
            *   *Above* if the green edge pixel touches the *top* edge of the *grid*.
            *   *Below* if the green edge pixel touches the *bottom* edge of the *grid*.
4.  **Zero Out**: Fill all remaining empty cells in the output_grid with 0.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
