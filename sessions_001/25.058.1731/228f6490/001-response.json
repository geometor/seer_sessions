The input grids appear to have distinct regions or \"objects\" of different colors. The transformation seems to involve swapping the colors of some of these objects based on some criteria. The background color seems to be consistently 0 (white) or 5(grey).\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Consider these regions as distinct objects.\n2.  **Find Swap Candidates:** Within the identified objects, find pairs according to a consistent rule between all three pairs.\n3. **Color Swap**: In each input grid, two groups of pixels are exchanging color, with the colors not changing, i.e. color1 becomes color2 and color2 becomes color1. Looking at train\\_1, color 8 becomes color 6, and color 6 becomes color 8. train\\_2, color 3 becomes color 9, and color 9 becomes color 3, and in train\\_3, color 2 becomes color 8, and color 8 becomes color 2.\n4.  **Apply Transformation:** Create the output grid by copying the input grid. The rule is to identify color pairs. The rest of the input pixels are unchanged.\n\n"
