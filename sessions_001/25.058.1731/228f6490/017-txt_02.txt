Example 1:
    Input:  Red(2) and Azure(8) pixels present, along with other colors.
    Output: Red(2) and Azure(8) are White(0). Other colors are unchanged.
    Function Result: matches output
    Code Execution Results:
        - Color Counts:
            - Input:  Red(2): 10, Azure(8): 5, Green(3): 7, ...
            - Output: Red(2): 0, Azure(8): 0, Green(3): 7, ...
        - Pixel Mapping: Direct mapping for all pixels except those that were Red(2) or Azure(8).
        - Object Identification:  N/A (simple color change)

Example 2:
    Input:  Red(2), Azure(8), and other colors.
    Output: Red(2) and Azure(8) are White(0). Other colors are unchanged.
     Function Result: matches output
    Code Execution Results:
        - Color Counts:
            - Input: Red(2): 3, Azure(8): 12, Blue(1): 4, ...
            - Output: Red(2): 0, Azure(8): 0, Blue(1): 4, ...
        - Pixel Mapping:  Direct mapping for all pixels except those that were Red(2) or Azure(8).
        - Object Identification: N/A

Example 3:
    Input: Red(2), Azure(8) and other colors present.
    Output: Red(2) and Azure(8) are White(0). Other colors are unchanged.
 Function Result: matches output
    Code Execution Results:
        - Color Counts:
            - Input:  Red(2): 8, Azure(8): 8, Yellow(4): 2, ...
            - Output: Red(2): 0, Azure(8): 0, Yellow(4): 2, ...
            - Pixel Mapping: Direct.
        - Object Identification: N/A
