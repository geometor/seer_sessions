1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of pixels with the same color. Consider these as separate objects.
2.  **Apply Color Change Rules:**

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate a plan to improve the natural language program and, subsequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code has a reasonable approach: identify objects, determine their quadrant, and change the color of internal grey pixels based on quadrant location. However, the results show that it's not entirely correct, indicating issues with either the quadrant determination, internal pixel identification, or the color-changing logic, or a combination. The current definition of "internal" is too restrictive, including only those completely surrounded by the same color. We need to adapt this to be more flexible.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze each example:** Examine the input, expected output, and actual output to pinpoint the discrepancies. Pay close attention to object shapes, sizes, positions, and colors.
2.  **Refine Object Properties**: Improve the description and identification of the internal part of grey objects to better match.
3.  **Adjust Color Change Logic:** Re-evaluate and correct color changes according to position.
4.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to capture all necessary transformation steps accurately.
5.  **Regenerate the code:** With updated YAML and program

**Example Analysis and Metrics**
I'll use comments within a python block to keep track of the analysis of each example, generating a metrics for correctness, this isn't code that should be part of the solution, but rather it's an aid in analysis.

          - change inner pixel color to green
      - if position is bottom_right:

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of grey pixels.
2.  **Determine Position and Change Color:** For each grey object:
    *   Determine if the object is in the top-left or bottom-right quadrant of the grid. The quadrant is determined by calculating a representative center (average row and column) of the object and comparing it to the center of the grid.
    *   Identify the "inner" pixels of the grey object.  Inner pixels are defined as grey pixels that have at least three grey neighbors (including diagonals).
    *   If the object is in the top-left quadrant, change the color of its inner pixels to green.
    *   If the object is in the bottom-right quadrant, change the color of its inner pixels to maroon.
3.  **Other Colors:** Pixels that are not part of a grey object remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
