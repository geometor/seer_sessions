Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies grey objects and changes the color of their "inner" pixels based on the object's quadrant location within the grid.

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of grey pixels.
2.  **Determine Position and Change Color:** For each grey object:
    *   Determine if the object is in the top-left or bottom-right quadrant of the grid.  The quadrant is determined by calculating the average row and column of the object's pixels and comparing this to the center of the grid.
    *   Identify the "inner" pixels of the grey object.  Inner pixels are defined as grey pixels that have at least three grey neighbors (including diagonals).
    *   If the object is in the top-left quadrant, change the color of its inner pixels to green.
    *   If the object is in the bottom-right quadrant, change the color of its inner pixels to maroon.
3.  **Other Colors:** Pixels that are not part of a grey object remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
