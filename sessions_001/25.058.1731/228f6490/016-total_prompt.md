Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors.
*   Some colors in the input grid change in the output grid, while others remain the same.
*   The color changes appear to be specific:
    *   Red (2) becomes White (0)
    *   Azure (8) becomes White(0)
    *   White(0) at [0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,0],[1,3],[2,0 to 3] becomes white, but remains same at [1,1],[1,2].
    *    White(0) near blue(8) remain 0, while white(0) near Red(2) become 0.

*   The positions of Yellow (4) and Gray (5) seem unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: integers (0-9)
      color_map:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
        3: green
        4: yellow
        5: gray
        6: magenta
        7: orange
        8: azure
        9: maroon

observations:
  - input:
      red_positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1], [1,2]]
      azure_positions: [[8,6], [8,7], [8,8], [9,7], [9,8]]

  - output:
      red_becomes_white: true
      azure_becomes_white: true
      yellow_unchanged: true
      gray_unchanged: true
      white_changes: "conditional"

transformations:
- color_change:
    from: 2  # Red
    to: 0 # White
- color_change:
    from: 8 # Azure
    to: 0  # White
- color_change
    from: 0
    to : 0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all pixels that are Red(2) or Azure(8).
2.  **Transform:** Change the color of all identified Red(2) and Azure(8) pixels to White (0).
3  **Preserve other:** Keep all other colors (Yellow, Gray, etc.) unchanged.

Based on the given example. It looks like colors Red(2) and Azure(8) turn into white(0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
