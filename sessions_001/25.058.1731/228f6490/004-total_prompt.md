Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors.
*   Most of the colors/numbers remain the same between the input and output.
*   There are specific areas where colors change. Specifically, it seems some `0`s are replaced, and there's a color swap/move involved. The azure `8` and magenta `6` are replaced with `0` and seem to "move".

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: object_group
    property: color_azure (8)
    initial_location: (9,1), (9,2)
    final_location: (3,2) (3,3)
    
  - type: object_group
    property: color_magenta (6)
    initial_location: (3,7), (3,8)
    final_location: (9,7), (9,8)
    
  - type: object_group
    property: color_grey (5)
    initial_location: all grey (5) pixels
    final_location: all grey (5) pixels
    
  - type: color
    value: 0
    property: background, fill, or replace.

actions:
  - type: replace
    target: object_group with color azure (8)
    replacement: object_group with color 0, at initial color 8 location
    
  - type: replace
    target: object_group with color magenta (6)
    replacement: object_group with color 0, at initial color 6 location
    
  - type: move
    object: object_group with color azure(8)
    from: (9,1), (9,2)
    to: (3,2), (3,3)
    
  - type: move
    object: object_group with color magenta (6)
    from: (3,7), (3,8)
    to: (9,7), (9,8)
    
  - type: replacement
    description: original azure (8) positions are changed to background (0)
    
  - type: replacement
    description: original magenta (6) positions are changed to background (0)
    

relationships:
  - "Azure (8) and Magenta (6) objects seem to swap positions, with a twist: their *original* positions are filled with background (0)."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find the two azure (8) pixels and the two magenta (6) pixels.
2.  **Record Positions:** Note the original coordinates of the azure (8) and magenta (6) pixels.
3.  **Move/Swap:** Move the azure (8) pixels to where the magenta (6) pixels *used to be*.
4.  **Move/Swap (cont.):** Move the magenta (6) pixels to where the azure (8) pixels *used to be*.
5. **Fill/Replace**: Change color value to `0` in the two positions where azure pixels *used to be*.
6. **Fill/Replace**: Change color value to `0` in the two positions where magenta pixels *used to be*.
7.  **Preserve:** All other pixels remain unchanged.

Essentially the azure and magenta blocks of 2 switch locations, with their previous position replaced with 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
