**input:**

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, specifically, three times wider. The colors and their relative positions seem to be preserved, but the output grid is a compressed/condensed version of the input. The core structure seems to involve taking a section of the input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: pixels
      properties:
        - color:  [0, 1, 2, 4] # white, blue, red, yellow
        - width: 12 (input), 4 (output)
        - height: 4 (input and output)

actions:
  - selection:
      description: A subgrid is selected from the input grid.
      parameters:
        - start_column: 0
        - end_column: 3 (inclusive)

relationships:
  - spatial: The output grid is a direct, proportionally shrunk section of the input grid, taking every third column starting at column 0.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input:** The input is a 2D grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Define Subgrid:** Define a subgrid selection that includes the entire height of the input grid and from column 0 to column 3.
3.  **Select and extract:** Extract the selection specified for output. The selected subgrid forms the entire output grid.

In simpler terms, the output grid is created by the leftmost section of the input, up to the fourth column.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
