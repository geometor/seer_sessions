**Perception of Elements:**

The core element appears to be 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the width of the grid, suggesting a process of extracting or summarizing columns. The consistent reduction to approximately a third of the original width, regardless of the height.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D (rows x columns)
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - height: variable
      - width: variable

actions:
  - type: column_extraction
    description: Selects specific columns from the input grid to form the output grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid:  has a wider width than output_grid
  - output_grid: is a subset of columns from input_grid
  - column_selection: appears to follow a consistent pattern (every third column. starting the first column).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Column Selection:** Iterate through the columns of the input grid, starting with the first column (index 0).
3.  **Extraction:** Select every third column. Specifically select column at index 0 and every column index is a multiple of 3.
4.  **Output Formation:** Construct the output grid using only the selected columns, maintaining their original order and all the rows.

Essentially, the transformation extracts every third column from the input, starting with the first, to generate the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
