The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid, specifically, three times wider. The colors and their relative positions seem to be preserved, but the output grid is a compressed/condensed version of the input. The core structure seems to involve taking a section of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
