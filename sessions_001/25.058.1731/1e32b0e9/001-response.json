The most prominent visual feature is a cross-shaped pattern formed by a single color (e.g., azure in the first example, red in the second, blue in the third). This cross consistently spans the entire height and width of the grid, centered. There are other colors present, which seem to form smaller, potentially connected shapes, often located near, but not on, the main cross. The transformation appears to involve altering or \"extending\" those non-cross colors along rows.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
