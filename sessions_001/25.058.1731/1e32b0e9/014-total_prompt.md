Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved expanding blue lines from blue and green pixels. The code implements this by identifying blue and green "seeds" and expanding blue pixels horizontally and vertically, while green pixels expand blue only vertically.

The additional training examples reveal that this initial program is too simplistic and likely incorrect. It appears that the direction and nature of the "expansion" might be determined by other factors, including surrounding context. Specifically, Example 2 shows that green generates a vertical expansion for blue, while example 3 shows that there is a blue horizontal expansion.

The strategy for improvement is as follows:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each input/output pair, I will carefully document:
    *   The locations of blue and green pixels in the input.
    *   The changes (expansions) observed in the output.
    *   The context (surrounding pixels) of the blue and green pixels.
    *   Any notable patterns or deviations from the original hypothesis.

2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, the initial hypothesis and natural language program will be adjusted. The adjustments may involve:
    *   Considering the context of the colored pixels.
    *   Re-evaluating the expansion rules.
    *  Looking for terminating condition for the expansion

3.  **Code Execution for Metrics:** I will use `code_execution` to perform targeted checks, confirming counts, colors, and relationships in specific cases.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Here, I analyze each example, calculating necessary metrics to support analysis.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
