```python
"""
The transformation rule involves expanding blue lines from existing blue and green pixels, stopping at edges or non-zero pixels.
Blue pixels expand both horizontally and vertically. 
Green pixels initiate a vertical expansion of blue *if* there's a blue pixel *anywhere* below it in the same column.
Green pixels initiate horizontal expansion of blue if there's a blue pixel *anywhere* to its right on the same row.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
