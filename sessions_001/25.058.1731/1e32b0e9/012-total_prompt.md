Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value (0-9). The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). There's a prominent horizontal blue line across the middle of the grid, and isolated green pixels scattered, mainly along other blue "lines". The transformation seems to involve adding blue pixels (1) adjacent to existing blue (1) and green (3) pixels. The core concept is related to creating a pattern of blue lines.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, blue, green]
      value: [0, 1, 3]
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [17, 17]

actions:
  - name: add_blue_pixel
    description: Place a blue pixel (1) at a specific location.
    preconditions:
      - Adjacent to an existing blue or green pixel.
    postconditions:
      -  blue pixel count increases.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels are considered adjacent horizontally and vertically, but _not_ diagonally, based on the output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seeds:** Locate all existing blue (1) and green (3) pixels in the input grid. These pixels act as "seeds" for the transformation.

2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For every seed pixel:
    *   Check its immediate left and right neighbors (horizontal adjacency).
    *   If a neighbor is white (0), change it to blue (1).

3.  **Vertical Expansion**: For every blue pixel and *every* green pixel:
    * Check immediate top and bottom neighbors.
    * If neighbor is white, change to blue.

4. Iterate applying 2 and 3, in order, for every seed.

It seems the green seeds are allowed to propagate vertically, but not horizontally, and the blue seeds can propagate in both directions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
