The primary colors present are white (0), blue (1), and red (2). There are distinct horizontal and vertical lines of red pixels, and some isolated or clustered blue pixels. The transformation seems to involve altering some, but not all, of the red pixels based on the positions of blue pixels. It looks like some kind of interaction of blue pixels with the background.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Identify horizontal and vertical lines formed by contiguous red pixels. Identify clusters/isolated instances of blue pixels.\n\n2.  **Blue Pixel Influence:** For each blue pixel, examine its surrounding red pixels.\n\n3. **Preserve red line:** Identify the cross of red pixels.\n\n4.  **Conditional Modification:**\n    *   If a red pixel is part of blue pixels connected components (8-way connectivity) : change it to the color matching the blue cluster.\n    *  Otherwise, if a red pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a blue pixel, change the red pixel to white (0).\n\n5.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the modified pixel colors.\n\nIn simpler terms, the blue pixels \"erase\" nearby red pixels, turning them white, unless the red pixel belongs to the crossing pattern created by the red lines. At blue pixel area, blue color is propagated to red neighbors.\n"
