The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). There's a prominent horizontal blue line across the middle of the grid, and isolated green pixels scattered, mainly along other blue \"lines\". The transformation seems to involve adding blue pixels (1) adjacent to existing blue (1) and green (3) pixels. The core concept is related to creating a pattern of blue lines.\n\n**YAML Documentation of Facts:**\n\n"

These pixels act as \"seeds\" for the transformation.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For every seed pixel:\n    *   Check its immediate left and right neighbors (horizontal adjacency).\n    *   If a neighbor is white (0), change it to blue (1).\n\n3.  **Vertical Expansion**: For every blue pixel and *every* green pixel:\n    * Check immediate top and bottom neighbors.\n    * If neighbor is white, change to blue.\n\n4. Iterate applying 2 and 3, in order, for every seed.\n\nIt seems the green seeds are allowed to propagate vertically, but not horizontally, and the blue seeds can propagate in both directions.\n"
