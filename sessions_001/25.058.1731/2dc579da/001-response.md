Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, factual documentation, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The core concept appears to be *filtering* or *selective extraction* of elements from the input grid. The output grids are significantly smaller than the input grids, and they seem to retain only specific colors or patterns, while discarding others. The position of retained elements seems relevant. There seems to be an "ignore" color/value that forms the "background", and only the unique/infrequent colors from the "foreground" are copied. It looks like any lines of just background are discarded.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger than output grids.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the colors present in the input grids.
  - observation: The background is filled with a consistent repeating color.
  - observation: The background color is removed
  - observation:  The lines and rows with only the background color are removed
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 5x5, 7x7, 11x11)
      - content: 2D array of color values (integers 0-9)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: smaller than input_grid
      - content: 2D array of color values (subset of input_grid)
  - action: filtering
    description: Selectively extracts elements from input_grid based on color and position.
  - relationship: output_grid is a filtered version of input_grid.
  - rule: "Only the values that are not the background color of any lines are kept"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Background Color**: Iterate each line, vertically and horizontally to collect the most consistent color.

2.  **Filter the Backround Lines**: Remove lines and columns that match the background color.

3.  **Construct Output:** Reconstruct the grid, and any empty grids are discarded.
