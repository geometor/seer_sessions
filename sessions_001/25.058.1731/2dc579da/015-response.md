Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of colored pixels (represented by digits). The dominant colors are green (3) and blue (1). There's a single azure (8) pixel. The output grid is smaller and seems to be a cropped section of the input grid, specifically centered around the azure pixel and excluding the blue pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [green, blue, azure]
      - dimensions:
          input: 11x11
          output: 5x5
  - name: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - location: [row, column]
  - name: azure_pixel
    instance_of: pixel
    properties:
        - color: 8
        - input_location: [2, 1]
  - name: blue_pixels
      instance_of: pixel
      properties:
        - color: 1
        - shape: "+" cross
actions:
  - name: crop
    description: Extract a rectangular sub-grid.
    parameters:
      - center: [row, column]
      - dimensions: [height, width]
relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: grid
    to: pixel
  - type: center_of_crop
    from: azure_pixel
    to: grid
  - type: excluded_from_crop
    from: blue_pixels
    to: grid

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the azure (8) pixel:** Find the location (row, column) of the single azure pixel within the input grid.
2.  **Determine Crop Boundaries:** The output grid appears to be a 5x5 region. The crop is centered on the azure pixel. Therefore, the boundaries are two rows/columns above, below, to the left, and to the right of the azure pixel.
3.  **Exclude Blue Region**: The output grid excludes everything that's on the blue "+" shape.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create the 5x5 output based on the crop dimensions and the position of the azure pixel.
5. **Crop:** Extract the pixels within the calculated boundaries from the input grid, constructing the output grid.

In simpler terms: Find the azure pixel. Crop a 5x5 square centered on it, excluding any pixels that were a part of the blue cross in the original image.
