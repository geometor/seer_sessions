            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, incorporating the new information from the training examples:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too specific, focusing on a 2x2 subgrid anchored by a yellow pixel and filtering green. The other training examples show this isn't the general rule. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis was overly narrow, based on just one example. The presence of green to be filtered is not a constant across examples. The output grid size of 2x2 is also not a constant. The position of the \"anchor\" pixel (initially assumed to be yellow) isn't consistently in the lower-left. It seems to be using other colors besides just yellow and azure as well.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Re-evaluate the \"anchor\" concept:** The yellow pixel might not be the consistent anchor. We need to analyze each example to see if there's a *different* consistent anchor, or if the anchoring mechanism is more complex (e.g., based on relative positions of *multiple* colors).\n2. **Determine the output size rule:** The 2x2 output isn't constant.  We need to find the rule governing the output dimensions. It might be related to the anchor, or to other features of the input grid.\n3. **Identify consistent filtering/inclusion rules:** Green isn't the only color being filtered (or, more accurately, *not included* in the output). We need to find the rule for which colors are included/excluded, and how their positions in the output are determined.\n4. **Examine relative positions:**  It's highly likely the output is a *selection* of pixels from the input, based on their position *relative* to some feature (the anchor, or something else). We need to analyze the coordinates of the included pixels in each example.\n5.  **Gather metrics:** run the existing code on each example input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution and manual inspection):**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, combining code execution results (where applicable) with manual analysis to extract the key information:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_pixel_by_color(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates of the first pixel of a given color.\"\"\"\n    for r, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for c, pixel in enumerate(row):\n            if pixel == color:\n                return (r, c)\n    return None\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Find the yellow pixel.\n    yellow_pos = find_pixel_by_color(input_grid, 4)\n    if yellow_pos is None:  # Handle cases where yellow might be missing.\n      yellow_pos = (0,0)\n\n    # Extract the 2x2 subgrid.\n    row_start = yellow_pos[0]\n    col_start = yellow_pos[1]\n   \n    output_grid = []\n    for r in range(row_start, min(row_start + 2, len(input_grid))):\n        row = []\n        for c in range(col_start, min(col_start + 2, len(input_grid[0]))):\n            #filter out green\n            if input_grid[r][c] != 3:\n              row.append(input_grid[r][c])\n            else:\n              #if green, don't append it\n              pass\n        #fill in the rest with azure if needed\n        while len(row) < 2:\n          row.append(8)\n\n        output_grid.append(row)\n    \n    #make sure we have 2 rows, fill with azure if needed\n    while len(output_grid) < 2:\n      output_grid.append([8,8])\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Example Data (replace with actual data from the task)\nexamples = [\n    {\n        \"input\": [[6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6], [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6]],\n        \"output\": [[4, 1], [1, 1]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6], [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6]],\n        \"output\": [[4, 1], [1, 1]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\n        \"output\": [[4, 0], [0, 0]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\" : [[6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6], [6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6]],\n        \"output\": [[4, 1], [1, 1]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]],\n        \"output\": [[4, 6], [6, 6]]\n    }\n\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n    input_grid = example[\"input\"]\n    expected_output = example[\"output\"]\n    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(f\"  Input:\\n{np.array(input_grid)}\")\n    print(f\"  Expected Output:\\n{np.array(expected_output)}\")\n    print(f\"  Predicted Output:\\n{np.array(predicted_output)}\")\n    print(f\"  Yellow Position: {find_pixel_by_color(input_grid, 4)}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n```\n\n**Example-by-Example Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 10x10, Yellow at (5, 5)\n    *   Expected Output: 2x2 `[[4, 1], [1, 1]]`\n    *   Predicted Output: `[[4, 1], [1, 1]]`\n    *   Observation: Correct.

This pixel serves as the center.\n2.  **Construct 2x2 Output:** Create a 2x2 output grid.\n3.  **Populate Output:** Copy the colors of the yellow pixel, and the pixels to the top, right and diagonal to the input grid at the location of the yellow pixel to the output grid. If the yellow pixel is at an edge, preventing a full 2x2 subgrid copy, the existing colors from the partial copy are still used.\n\nThe key insight is that the yellow pixel is the consistent \"center\", and a 2x2 block centered around it, (with wrapping) defines the output. There is no filtering based on colors.\n"
