Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (8x8) of pixels into a smaller grid (3x6). The primary color involved is azure (8), with a background of white (0). The input grid contains a somewhat irregular shape formed by azure pixels, while the output grid seems to be a condensed and potentially rotated representation of the azure shape. It's difficult to say definitively if it's a rotation or a reflection combined with some elimination, it's important to identify if the white cells inside the azure object in the output were part of the transformation or just never there.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 8x8
    elements:
      - color: 0  # White
        role: background
      - color: 8  # Azure
        role: foreground_object
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x6
    elements:
      - color: 0  # White
        role: background
      - color: 8  # Azure
        role: foreground_object
  - action: transformation
    type: condensation_and_rearrangement
    details: The input grid's azure object is condensed and possibly rotated/reflected to form the output grid's azure object. Some rows and columns are removed.
  - spatial_relationship:
      type: top left corner becomes right edge
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the foreground object:** Locate all pixels with the value '8' (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Isolate Object rows and columns** create subset of rows and columns that contain the object.
3.  **Condense and potentially reorient:** it will look like three rows
    *   The first row of output will contain all columns with at least one azure pixel, a azure pixel in the output row if the input column contains any object pixels, otherwise white.
    *   The second row skips columns with azure pixels only in the first row of the original.
    *   the third row contains azure pixels if the input row had an azure pixel, otherwise white.

The transformation extracts the shape of the azure object from the input, and uses this as instructions for building the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
