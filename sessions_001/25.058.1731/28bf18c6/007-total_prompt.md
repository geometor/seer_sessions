Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts the shape of the azure object from the input, and uses this as instructions for building the output.

1.  **Identify the Azure Object:** Locate all pixels with the value '8' (azure) in the input grid. This defines the "object" of interest.

2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The output grid's height is equal to the number of rows in the input grid that contain at least one azure pixel.
    *   The output grid's width is equal to the number of columns in the input grid that contain at least one azure pixel.

3. **Populate the Output Grid:** Iterate through each cell of the *potential* output grid (using the dimensions determined in step 2).
   *   Get the corresponding row index (`r`) from the input grid, skipping rows with all non-azure pixels.
   *   Get the corresponding column index (`c`) from the input grid, skipping columns with all non-azure pixels.
   *   If the input grid cell at `input_grid[r][c]` contains an azure pixel, the output cell will also be azure. Otherwise the output cell will be white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
