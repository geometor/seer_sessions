The primary colors involved are white (0) and red (2). The input grid appears to be larger (8x8) than the output grid (3x6). The red pixels in the input form a somewhat irregular shape in the lower-left corner. The output grid consists entirely of red and white pixels, with a seemingly more structured pattern. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple cropping or down-sampling, as the relative positions of the red pixels change.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
