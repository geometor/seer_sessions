Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts the shape of the azure object from the input, and uses this as instructions for building the output.

1.  **Identify the foreground object:** Locate all pixels with the value '8' (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Isolate Object rows and columns** create subset of rows and columns that contain the object.
3.  **Condense and potentially reorient:** it will look like three rows
    *   The first row of output will contain all columns with at least one azure pixel, a azure pixel in the output row if the input column contains any object pixels, otherwise white.
    *   The second row skips columns with azure pixels only in the first row of the original.
    *   the third row contains azure pixels if the input row had an azure pixel, otherwise white.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
