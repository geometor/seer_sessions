Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** An 8x8 grid. Most cells are '0' (white), with a small cluster of '1' (blue) cells near the center-right. The blue cells appear to form a connected shape, potentially an "object".
*   **Output:** A 3x6 grid. It contains only '0' (white) and '1' (blue) cells. It seems to capture the 'essence' of the blue object in the input but in a different, more abstract, or encoded form. The configuration of 0s and 1s within the output grid seems directly related to the position, shape, and distribution of the 1's (blue cells) within the input grid.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation is *not* a simple sub-region extraction. It's some form of encoding or abstract representation. The output dimensions are not derived directly by cropping the input. The output grid represents a *boolean matrix*: it contains the bounding box of the blue shape in the input, where '1' corresponds to filled parts and '0' to empty parts of that bounding box.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: blue_shape
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: irregular, connected
      - location: center-right (in input)
    input_grid:
      dimensions: 8x8
      background_color: white (0)
    output_grid:
      dimensions: 3x6
      background_color: alternating, encodes blue_shape
      encoding: boolean matrix of input's blue shape bounding box
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Bounding Box:** Find the smallest rectangle (bounding box) within the input grid that completely encloses all blue (value '1') pixels.
2. **Create Boolean Matrix** Create an output grid whose dimesions are the dimensions of the bounding box.
3. **Encode Bounding Box:** Iterate through the input grid, filling each output grid with '1' if the value in the input inside the bounding box is '1', and '0' otherwise.

In essence, the program extracts a "boolean matrix" corresponding to a bounding box of the '1' values in the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
