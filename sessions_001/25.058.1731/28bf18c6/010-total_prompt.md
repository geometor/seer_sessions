Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid. The primary colors involved are white (0) and red (2). The input grid appears to be larger (8x8) than the output grid (3x6). The red pixels in the input form a somewhat irregular shape in the lower-left corner. The output grid consists entirely of red and white pixels, with a seemingly more structured pattern. The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple cropping or down-sampling, as the relative positions of the red pixels change.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [8, 8] # Input grid dimensions
      elements: integers (0-9) # representing colors
    role: input

  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 6] # Output grid dimensions
      elements: integers (0-9)
    role: output
    
  - type: shape
    properties:
     color: 2
     contiguous: true
    role: input_shape

actions:
  - type: transform
    description: Converts the input grid to the output grid.
    details: The exact nature of the transformation is to be determined.

relationships:
  - subject: input_shape
    relation: transformed_to
    object: output_grid #relates input shape to output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the red shape:** Locate the contiguous block of red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Bounding Box:** Determine the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that fully encloses the red shape. In this example, it is defined by row 5, column 3 to row 7, column 4.
3  **Analyze shape:** Find the first row of the shape.
4.  **Reconstruct:** Create the new grid where:
      -The first row alternates white and red pixels, the count of red pixels = count of pixels in first row, starting on the second position,
      - The second row is filled with red pixels, size = row_size * 2 of the input_shape.
      - The third row is the first row of the input mirrored.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
