The primary color involved is azure (8), with a background of white (0). The input grid contains a somewhat irregular shape formed by azure pixels, while the output grid seems to be a condensed and potentially rotated representation of the azure shape. It's difficult to say definitively if it's a rotation or a reflection combined with some elimination, it's important to identify if the white cells inside the azure object in the output were part of the transformation or just never there.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
