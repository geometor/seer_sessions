facts:
  - observation: Input grids are 8x8, output grids have three rows with varying lengths (e.g. 6x3, 3x6).
  - object_type: Input grid: Contains a single contiguous region of non-zero pixels (an "object").
  - object_color: The color of the "object" varies (azure, red, blue).
  - background_color: The background of both input and output is always color 0 (white).
  - transformation_type: Compression and rearrangement of the input "object".
  - output_structure: Alternating columns of the object's color and 0 (white).
  - spatial_relation: The object in the output maintains a relationship to the original object's shape and position, but is compressed.
  - color_consistency:  The non-zero color in the output matches the color of the "object" in the input.
