Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts the shape of the azure object from the input, and uses this as instructions for building the output.

1.  **Identify the foreground object:** Locate all pixels with the value '8' (azure) in the input grid.
2.  **Isolate Object rows and columns** create subset of rows and columns that contain the object.
3.  **Condense and potentially reorient:** it will look like three rows
    *   The first row of output will contain all columns with at least one azure pixel, a azure pixel in the output row if the input column contains any object pixels, otherwise white.
    *   The second row skips columns with azure pixels only in the first row of the original.
    *   the third row contains azure pixels if the input row had an azure pixel, otherwise white.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which it handled correctly. However, the subsequent examples reveal that the transformation is more complex than initially perceived. The core idea of extracting information from the azure object's shape is correct, but the way this information dictates the output grid's structure is different across examples. The initial assumption of a fixed 3x6 output grid is incorrect, as is the logic for populating the three rows. The output grid's dimensions and content are directly derived from the input's azure object, but in a more sophisticated way than first thought. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Analyzing Object Properties:** Carefully examining the shape, size, and position of the azure object in each input.
2.  **Output Dimensions:** Determining how the azure object's properties correlate with the output grid's dimensions.
3.  **Output Content:** Figuring out the precise rule that maps the azure object's presence in rows and columns to the output pixels.
4. **Refine Program**: updating the natural language program to accurately
   describe the refined algorithm.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get precise observations I will define a function, `analyze_example`, that will perform this function and help gather observations.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, object_color=8):
    """
    Analyzes a single input-output pair and returns a dictionary of observations.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)

    object_rows, object_cols = np.where(input_grid == object_color)

    if len(object_rows) == 0:
        return {
            "object_present": False,
            "input_shape": input_grid.shape,
            "output_shape": output_grid.shape
        }

    min_row, max_row = np.min(object_rows), np.max(object_rows)
    min_col, max_col = np.min(object_cols), np.max(object_cols)

    object_height = max_row - min_row + 1
    object_width = max_col - min_col + 1

    # Count object pixels in each row and column
    object_pixels_per_row = np.sum(input_grid == object_color, axis=1)
    object_pixels_per_col = np.sum(input_grid == object_color, axis=0)

    output_object_rows, output_object_cols = np.where(output_grid == object_color)
    output_object_height = 0
    output_object_width = 0
    if (len(output_object_rows) > 0):
      output_object_height = np.max(output_object_rows) - np.min(output_object_rows) + 1
      output_object_width = np.max(output_object_cols) - np.min(output_object_cols) + 1

    return {
        "object_present": True,
        "input_shape": input_grid.shape,
        "output_shape": output_grid.shape,
        "object_height": object_height,
        "object_width": object_width,
        "object_pixels_per_row": object_pixels_per_row,
        "object_pixels_per_col": object_pixels_per_col,
        "output_object_height": output_object_height,
        "output_object_width": output_object_width
    }

def get_example_results(task):
  results = []
  for example in task["train"]:
    results.append(analyze_example(example["input"], example["output"]))
  return results
```

Now, let's gather data. I'll call this function, and format the result.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import json

task_file = Path("a85d4709.json")
task = json.loads(task_file.read_text())

results = get_example_results(task)
print (json.dumps(results, indent=2))
```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
- example_1:
    input:
        object_color: azure (8)
        object_shape: irregular
        object_height: 6
        object_width: 9
    output:
        shape: [3, 6] # height, width
        content_rule: |
            Output rows and columns corresponds to input rows/cols with object pixels.
            Output cell is object color if both input row and column have object pixels,
            otherwise background color.
- example_2:
    input:
        object_color: azure (8)
        object_shape: vertical line
        object_height: 7
        object_width: 3
    output:
        shape: [7, 3]
        content_rule: Same as example_1
- example_3:
    input:
        object_color: azure (8)
        object_shape: small square
        object_height: 2
        object_width: 2
    output:
        shape: [2, 2]
        content_rule: Same as example_1
- example_4:
    input:
        object_color: azure (8)
        object_shape: irregular
        object_height: 8
        object_width: 7
    output:
        shape: [4, 7]
        content_rule: Same as example_1
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Azure Object:** Locate all pixels with the value '8' (azure) in the input grid. This defines the "object" of interest.

2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**
    *   The output grid's height is equal to the number of rows in the input grid that contain at least one azure pixel.
    *   The output grid's width is equal to the number of columns in the input grid that contain at least one azure pixel.

3. **Populate the Output Grid:** Iterate through each cell of the *potential* output grid (using the dimensions determined in step 2).
   *   Get the corresponding row index (`r`) from the input grid, skipping rows with all non-azure pixels.
   *   Get the corresponding column index (`c`) from the input grid, skipping columns with all non-azure pixels.
   *   If the input grid cell at `input_grid[r][c]` contains an azure pixel, the output cell will also be azure. Otherwise the output cell will be white (0).

In essence, the output grid is a condensed representation of the input grid, where only the rows and columns containing the azure object are preserved, and the cells are azure if the corresponding original row and column both had an azure, otherwise white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
