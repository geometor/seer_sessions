Most cells are '0' (white), with a small cluster of '1' (blue) cells near the center-right. The blue cells appear to form a connected shape, potentially an \"object\".\n*   **Output:** A 3x6 grid. It contains only '0' (white) and '1' (blue) cells. It seems to capture the 'essence' of the blue object in the input but in a different, more abstract, or encoded form. The configuration of 0s and 1s within the output grid seems directly related to the position, shape, and distribution of the 1's (blue cells) within the input grid.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation is *not* a simple sub-region extraction. It's some form of encoding or abstract representation. The output dimensions are not derived directly by cropping the input. The output grid represents a *boolean matrix*: it contains the bounding box of the blue shape in the input, where '1' corresponds to filled parts and '0' to empty parts of that bounding box.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
