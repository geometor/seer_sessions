These lines act as delimiters.\n2.  **Isolate Colored Regions:** Within each section bounded by the grey lines (or the edge of the grid), identify any connected regions of non-white (0) and non-grey(5) colors.\n3. **Identify replication zone:** Locate the zone at the bottom, beneath the last horizontal grey(5) line.\n4.  **Replicate Colored Regions:** For each identified colored region above the last horizontal grey line, check if the region to be replicated is composed by 1 or more pixels.\n    * if the colored region is one single pixel replicate a 3x1 region of the same color in the replication zone.\n    * if the original region is already 3x1, create a copy.\n    Maintain the horizontal order of the replicated colored pixels in the last section.
