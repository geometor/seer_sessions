Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  **Identify:** Locate all red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Consider Gray Columns**: Note the positions of Gray (5) pixels which form partial vertical columns from top of grid.
3.  **Transformation**:
    *   If a Red(2) is in a gray (5) column and above the horizontal gray bar: it remains at same position, other wise, it is moved right until it is next to the gray column.
    *   If a Red(2) is in a gray (5) column and below the horizontal gray bar: it is replace by a white(0).
    *    If a red(2) pixel is to the left of the gray (5) column and and above the horizontal gray bar, it is moved adjacent to the column by filling the pixels to its right and at same level with red(2) .
4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the modified red pixel positions, keeping all other pixels the same as the input.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
