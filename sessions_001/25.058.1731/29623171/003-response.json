The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), and blue (1). The input grid contains two horizontal lines of gray pixels and several isolated blue pixels, some adjacent to the gray lines and some not. The output grid appears to retain the gray lines and some parts related to blue, but most of the blue pixels vanish, and a new blue shape (or object) appears at the bottom right.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The origin will be the second element to the right of the most right gray in bottom line.\n\nIn summary, the transformation seems to involve preserving gray lines, and conditionally removing blue blocks except ones connected to a gray at bottom right and creating a blue square at the bottom, based on the horizontal position of bottom gray elements.\n"
