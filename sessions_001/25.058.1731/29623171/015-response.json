There are isolated and clustered green (3) pixels.\n*   **Transformation:** The primary change seems to be related to the green pixels. Some green pixels disappear, and others seem to consolidate into a rectangular block at the bottom right.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These lines divide the grid into sections.\n\n2.  **Locate green pixels:** Identify all green (3) pixels within the grid.\n\n3. **Preserve the grey grid:** The grey portion of the grid is unchaged.\n\n4.  **Green Pixel Removal:** Remove all green (3) pixels, *except* for those in the bottom-rightmost section of the grid.\n\n5.  **Green Pixel Consolidation:** Within the bottom-rightmost section, arrange any remaining green pixels into a contiguous 3x3 rectangle in the bottom-right corner of that section. If green pixels are less than 9, create a horizontal green line of width equal to number of green pixels starting at bottom right.\n\nIn summary, the transformation preserves the gray grid, removes most green pixels except those at the bottom right of the grid. The surviving green pixels coalesce into a solid rectangle at the grid bottom right.\n"
