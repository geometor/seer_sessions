            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the current code and refine the natural language program and observations.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe code performs reasonably well on the first example, which was the basis for its design. However, the other examples reveal some limitations:\n\n1.  **Multiple Horizontal Bars:** The initial assumption of a single, longest horizontal gray bar is incorrect. There can be multiple gray bars of different lengths. The logic needs to consider all gray structures, not just the longest.\n2.  **Red Expansion Logic:** The rule for extending red pixels to the right until a gray column is encountered works in simple cases, but fails when gray structures are more complex or when other red pixels are encountered.\n3.   **Adjacent Red Pixels:** There are cases in other examples where two Red(2) pixels are horizontally adjacent. In this circumstance, the fill should only fill the next cell if it's a White(0) cell.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Revisit Gray Structure Identification:** Instead of finding only the *longest* horizontal gray bar, we need to identify *all* contiguous horizontal gray lines.\n2.  **Refine Red Pixel Transformation:**\n    *   The \"extend to the right\" logic needs to be more precise. It should stop at *any* obstacle (gray column, edge of grid, or another red pixel).\n    *   The fill should only happen if the next cell value is 0 (White).\n3.  **Consider All Gray Lines:** The transformation of red pixels should be relative to *all* detected gray lines, not just the longest one.\n4. **Example 3:** This example introduces a Red pixel on the *same* row as a Gray row. Add logic to consider and maintain Red pixels *on* Gray rows.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis):**\n\nTo better understand the patterns, let's gather some data. Because I don't have `code_execution` capabilities in this environment, I'll have to manually describe the observations. I would, in a real setting, write code to compute these automatically.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Correct):**\n    *   Input: Single horizontal gray bar, red pixels above and below.\n    *   Output: Red pixels above extend to the right until a gray column; red pixels below turn white.\n    *   *Observation:* The current logic works as intended in this simple case.\n*   **Example 2 (Incorrect):**\n    *   Input: Two horizontal gray bars, red pixels above, between, and below.\n    *   Output: Only red pixels above the *longest* gray bar are extended. Red pixels between bars are not handled correctly.\n    *   *Observation:* The logic fails to account for multiple horizontal gray bars.\n*   **Example 3 (Incorrect):**\n    *   Input: Red pixels on the *same row* as the horizontal gray bar.\n    *    Output: All Red Pixels are cleared, instead of remaining unchanged.\n    *   *Observation:* The logic needs to be updated to account for pixels on gray rows.\n* **Example 4(Incorrect):**\n    *    Input: Two Red(2) pixels adjacent.\n    *    Output: The first red is extended the full distance to the Gray, and the 2nd Red pixel remains.\n    *   *Observation:* Red pixels should only be extended to the next pixel if it is a White(0).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: red_pixels\n    color: 2\n    properties:\n      - can_be_above_gray_lines: true\n      - can_be_below_gray_lines: true\n      - can_be_on_gray_lines: true\n      - extendable: conditionally\n  - name: gray_lines\n    color: 5\n    properties:\n      - shape: horizontal_lines\n      - variable_length: true\n      - multiple_instances: possible\n  - name: gray_columns\n    color: 5\n    properties:\n       -shape: vertical_lines\n       - variable_length: true\n  - name: white_pixels\n    color: 0\n    properties:\n      - default_background: true\n      - changeable: true\n\nactions:\n  - name: extend_red\n    object: red_pixels\n    condition: above_gray_line_and_left_of_gray_column_and_next_to_white\n    transformation: fill_right_until_obstacle\n  - name: clear_red\n    object: red_pixels\n    condition: below_any_gray_line\n    transformation: change_to_white\n  - name: no_change\n    object: red_pixels\n    condition: on_gray_line\n    transformation: remain\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Gray Structures:** Find all horizontal gray lines (contiguous sequences of gray pixels) and all vertical gray columns in the input grid.\n2.  **Categorize Red Pixels:** For each red pixel, determine its position relative to the gray lines:\n    *   **Above:** If the red pixel's row is above *any* gray line.\n    *   **Below:** If the red pixel's row is below *any* gray line.\n    * **On:** If the Red Pixel's row is *on* any gray line.\n3.  **Transform Red Pixels:**\n    *   **Above any Gray Line:** If a red pixel is above any gray line AND left of a gray column AND is adjacent to a White(0) pixel horizontally, extend it to the right, changing White(0) pixels to Red(2), until it encounters a gray column, the edge of the grid, or another Red(2) pixel.\n    *   **Below any Gray Line:** Change the red pixel to white (0).\n    *   **On any Gray Line:** The red pixel should remain unchanged.\n4.  **Output:** Create the output grid with these transformations, keeping all other pixels (gray and white) unchanged from the input.\n"
