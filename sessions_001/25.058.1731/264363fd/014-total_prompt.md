Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify and Remove:** Locate and remove all blue pixels, these constitute the background.

2.  **Identify and Remove:** Locate all single yellow pixels (1x1 yellow rectangles) and remove them.

3.  **Identify and Shift Rectangles:** Find all red rectangles. Shift each red rectangle to the leftmost position within its row. Maintain the rectangle's shape during the shift.

4.  **Identify Green Lines:** Find the original positions of green pixels. For each row or column that contains green pixels, perform the next step.

5.  **Alternate Line Colors:** Starting with red, alternate the colors between red and green *only* at the original positions where a green pixel was found, skip the other positions.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, but the tests reveal some inaccuracies. The primary issues are:

1.  **Incorrect Handling of Yellow:** The program intended to remove single yellow pixels, but the `find_rectangles` function, by design, ignores all 1x1 color blocks. It is correctly skipping them, but not explicitly.
2.  **Incomplete Alternation Logic:** The green/red alternation is only occurring at the *exact* original green pixel positions. It doesn't consider the broader context of rows and columns containing those green pixels. The alternation should extend across the rows and columns that contain green pixels, but it's overly localized.
3.  **Incorrect Alternation Start:** there is some off-by-one error in the alternation logic.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Clarify Yellow Pixel Handling:** Revise the natural language program to acknowledge that any color 1x1 pixels are implicitly ignored (since they're not rectangles).
2.  **Expand Alternation:** Modify both the natural language program and the code to correctly alternate colors across entire rows/cols containing green, not just at the specific green pixel locations. Use the positions of the original green pixels from the input grid as "markers" to determine *which* rows/columns to affect.
3. **Correct Alternation Start:** update the logic for alternating between red and green to ensure it aligns to examples.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately assess the examples, I'll use a combination of observation and, where needed, hypothetical code execution (since I can't actually run code here).

*Example 1:*

*   Input: Blue background, a few red and green pixels, some single yellow pixels.
*   Expected Output: Red and green pixels alternating in the row and column of original green pixels. Single yellow pixels should remain ignored
*   Actual Output: The red/green alternation only happened at the original green pixel locations, not across the entire relevant row/column.
*   Metrics:
    *   Number of red rectangles: Can be determined using `find_rectangles(input_grid, 2)`.
    *   Green pixel positions: Can be determined with `find_green_positions(input_grid)`.
    *   Rows/Cols with green: Derived from green positions.

*Example 2:*

*   Input: Similar to Example 1, but with a different arrangement.
*   Expected Output: Consistent with Example 1's rules.
*   Actual Output: Same error as Example 1 regarding alternation.
*   Metrics: Same metrics as Example 1.

*Example 3:*

*    Input: Similar to Example 1.
*    Expected Output: Consistent with Example 1 and Example 2.
*    Actual Output: The logic seems to be correct.

```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
      - type: background
        color: blue
        behavior: removed
      - type: pixel
        color: yellow
        size: 1x1
        behavior: ignored
      - type: rectangle
        color: red
        behavior: shifted left within its row
      - type: pixel
        color: green
        behavior: determine rows and columns for color alternation, these locations have special behavior
  - actions:
      - remove: blue background
      - ignore: single yellow pixels
      - shift: red rectangles to the leftmost position in their row
      - alternate: colors in rows/columns containing green, using the original green pixel positions as a trigger, skipping any other positions.
      - alternation_pattern: start with green for even numbered original positions, red for odd numbered positions
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Remove Background:** Remove all blue pixels.
2.  **Ignore Single Pixels:** All single 1x1 pixels of any color are ignored for the rest of the process.
3.  **Shift Red Rectangles:** Locate all red rectangles (blocks of 2+ red pixels). Shift each red rectangle to the leftmost possible position within its row.
4.  **Identify Green Markers:** Find the original positions of all green pixels in the *input* grid. These positions act as "markers".
5.  **Alternate Colors in Marked Rows/Cols:** For each row and column that contains at least one green marker:
    *   Iterate through only the original green markers positions.
    *   At each position, use the position index of the original green positions, alternate the color between green and red, starting with green if the position is even numbered, and red if the index is odd numbered.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
