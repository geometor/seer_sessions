            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good start, capturing the core idea of a constrained flood fill within a border. However, the provided test results show discrepancies, indicating that the logic needs adjustments. The primary issue seems to be the way the interior is determined and how the stopping conditions of flood fill are handled.  Some examples suggest it isn't just a simple rectangular border, or the fill is starting with incorrect assumptions.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Interior Detection:** The `find_interior` function assumes a simple rectangular border defined by the first and last non-border pixels. This is likely too simplistic. We need a more robust method to identify the region where the flood fill should occur, which is not neccessarily rectangular.\n2.  **Verify Starting Pixels:** We're assuming all green pixels within the initially defined interior are starting points. This might be incorrect.\n3.  **Refine Flood Fill Constraints:**  The flood fill stopping condition needs to be very precise. We're currently stopping at the border color (8) and existing fill color (2). There might be other factors.\n4. Consider if there's an implicit \"objectness\" concept being missed - e.g. distinct regions to be filled even within an overall bounded area.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo understand the errors, let's analyze each example's input, expected output, and actual output.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    description = f\"Shape: {rows}x{cols}\\n\"\n    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)\n    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))\n    for color, count in color_counts.items():\n        description += f\"Color {color}: {count} pixels\\n\"\n    return description\n\ndef compare_grids(grid1, grid2):\n    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:\n        return \"Shapes are different.\\n\"\n    diff = grid1 != grid2\n    diff_coords = np.where(diff)\n    num_diffs = len(diff_coords[0])\n    description = f\"Number of differing pixels: {num_diffs}\\n\"\n    if num_diffs > 0:\n        description += \"Differing pixel coordinates and values:\\n\"\n        for i in range(num_diffs):\n            r, c = diff_coords[0][i], diff_coords[1][i]\n            description += f\"  ({r}, {c}): Expected {grid2[r, c]}, Got {grid1[r, c]}\\n\"\n    return description\ntrain_ex = [\n    ([\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    ],\n     [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    ]),\n    ([\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    ],\n     [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n     ]),\n    ([\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n    ],\n     [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n     ]),\n    ([\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n        [8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n    ],\n     [\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 3, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n        [8, 2, 2, 2, 3, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n     ])\n]\n\nfrom previous_code import transform\n\nfor i, (input_grid, expected_output) in enumerate(train_ex):\n    input_grid_np = np.array(input_grid)\n    expected_output_np = np.array(expected_output)\n    actual_output_np = transform(input_grid_np)\n\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(\"Input Grid:\")\n    print(describe_grid(input_grid_np))\n    print(\"Expected Output:\")\n    print(describe_grid(expected_output_np))\n    print(\"Actual Output:\")\n    print(describe_grid(actual_output_np))\n    print(\"Comparison:\")\n    print(compare_grids(actual_output_np, expected_output_np))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n```\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  -

These form the boundary.\n2.  **Locate Green Pixels:** Within the grid bounded by azure, locate all green (3) pixels.\n3.  **Flood Fill:** For *each* green pixel:\n    *   Perform a flood fill operation using red (2) as the fill color.\n    *   The flood fill should stop when it encounters an azure (8) pixel or a red(2) pixel.\n    * The fill should propagate in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).\n4.  **Result:** The final output grid consists of the original azure border, the green pixels, and red pixels resulting from the flood fill operations.\n\nThe most significant changes from the previous version are:\n* No assumption of a rectangular interior\n* Explicit statement of performing a separate flood fill for *each* green pixel.\n* Clarify that existing Red pixels *and* azure pixels stop the fill\n"
