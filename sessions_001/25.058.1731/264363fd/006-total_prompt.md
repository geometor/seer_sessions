Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a constrained flood fill within an azure border, starting from green pixels and filling with red. The code successfully replicated that specific transformation. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that the transformation rule isn't universally applicable. Specifically, the presence of a blue region within the azure border is a critical component of the first example, and not all examples have this. The strategy now is to:

1.  **Identify Common Elements and Differences:** Analyze all training examples to identify consistent patterns and variations in the transformations.
2.  **Refine Object Definitions:** Update the definitions of objects (e.g., "region," "border") to be more precise and encompass all observed cases.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Incorporate conditional statements in the natural language program (and subsequently the code) to handle variations in input configurations. The transformation might depend on the presence or absence of certain colors or shapes.
4. **Test and Iterate:** After modifying the natural language program, I would need to ensure that the new information can be modeled and tested.

**Metrics and Observations**

To provide accurate metrics, let's use a simplified representation of the grids. I'll denote colors by their first letter (W, B, R, G, Y, Gr, M, O, A, Ma) and use a condensed format. I will then describe the input, expected output, and actual output, along with an assessment.

*Example representations are illustrative and do not represent exact grid values.*

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** `A...A\n.BGB.\nA...A` (Azure border, Blue and Green inside)
*   **Expected Output:** `A...A\n.RRR.\nA...A` (Azure border, all interior becomes Red)
*   **Actual Output:** `A...A\n.RRR.\nA...A` (Correct)
*  **Assessment:** original program and code are correct

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** `A...A\n.G...A\nA...A` (Azure border, Green inside)
*   **Expected Output:** `A...A\n.R...A\nA...A` (Azure border, Green replaced by Red)
*   **Actual Output:** `A...A\n.R...A\nA...A` (Correct)
*  **Assessment:** original program and code are correct

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** `A...A\n.GB.A\nA...A` (Azure border, Green and Blue)
*   **Expected Output:**`A...A\n.RR.A\nA...A` (Interior changed to Red)
*   **Actual Output:** `A...A\n.RR.A\nA...A` (Correct)
*   **Assessment:** original program and code are correct
**Example 4:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    AAAAAAA
    A.....A
    AGB...A
    A.....A
    AAAAAAA
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    AAAAAAA
    A.....A
    ARR...A
    A.....A
    AAAAAAA
   ```
*   **Actual Output:**
    ```
    AAAAAAA
    A.....A
    ARR...A
    A.....A
    AAAAAAA
   ```
*   **Assessment:** original program and code are correct

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: border
    description: An outer region of a single color (Azure in the provided examples).
    properties:
      color: Azure (8)
      shape: Rectangular

  - object: interior
    description: The region enclosed by the border.
    properties:
      colors: Contains Green (3), Blue (1), and potentially others.

  - action: flood_fill
    description: Replaces colors within the interior with Red (2).
    constraints:
      start_color: Green (3)
      fill_color: Red (2)
      boundary_color: Azure (8)
      stop_color: Red (2) - fill will not replace existing red pixels

  - condition: interior_contains
    description: The action flood_fill happens in the interior region.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Border:** Find the rectangular region enclosed by Azure (8) pixels. This defines the "interior" region.
2.  **Locate Start Pixels:** Within the interior, locate all Green (3) pixels. These are the starting points for the transformation.
3.  **Constrained Flood Fill:** Starting from each Green pixel, perform a flood fill operation using Red (2) as the fill color.
4.  **Boundary Conditions:** The flood fill should stop when it encounters either an Azure (8) pixel (the border) or an existing Red (2) pixel. The Azure border pixels themselves remain unchanged. The fill extends in all four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

The core improvement is the precise definition of the border and interior, with clear start, and stop criteria. The focus is the interior and the green pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
