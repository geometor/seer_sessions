Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid (10x10) of pixels, where each pixel can be one of two colors: white (0) or green (3). The transformation seems to involve expanding or "filling in" the green regions. Specifically, the isolated green pixels in the input become connected horizontally to form a contiguous green region in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [10, 10]
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        color_values: [0, 3]  # 0: white, 3: green
        properties:
          - color
          - position

observations:
  - The input grid contains disconnected green pixels.
  - The output grid contains a connected region of green pixels that are the two center rows.
  - Green pixels can appear with one or two white pixels in between to expand.

actions:
  - fill_horizontally: Connect green pixels horizontally to form a single contiguous block.
  - preserve_color_values: Maintain original color value.

relationships:
  - spatial: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - connectivity: Disconnected green pixels in the input become connected in the output.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Pixels:** Locate all pixels with a value of 3 (green) in the input grid.
2.  **Connect the first two rows**: Connect the first two rows of green to be a solid green.
3.  **Connect the next row**: Connect the green pixels in the third row, maintaining two green pixels in the center.
4. **Connect the bottom rows**: Connect the two green pixels in the fourth and fifth rows.
