objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [10, 10]
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        color_values: [0, 3]  # 0: white, 3: green
        properties:
          - color
          - position

observations:
  - The input grid contains disconnected green pixels.
  - The output grid contains a connected region of green pixels that are the two center rows.
  - Green pixels can appear with one or two white pixels in between to expand.

actions:
  - fill_horizontally: Connect green pixels horizontally to form a single contiguous block.
  - preserve_color_values: Maintain original color value.

relationships:
  - spatial: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid.
  - connectivity: Disconnected green pixels in the input become connected in the output.
