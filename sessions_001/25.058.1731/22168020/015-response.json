One region is magenta (color 6) in the top-left, and the other is azure (color 8) in the bottom-right. The rest of the grid is white (color 0). The shapes formed by the colored regions appear to be contiguous. The magenta and azure regions do not touch, and there appears to be a clear separation of five rows, including and in-between the two distinct objects.\n*   **Output:** The same 10x10 grid. The magenta and azure regions have expanded horizontally. Specifically, the magenta region has filled the available space to its right in the original rows where it was present. The azure region has filled the space to its left, in the rows where it was originally present, maintaining the general shape of the regions.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
