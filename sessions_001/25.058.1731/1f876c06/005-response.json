            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the vertical reflection transformation code and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code implements a vertical reflection, but it clears the source\npixel after moving, turning the reflection into more of a move/translation to\na mirrored position, setting the origination to zero.\n\nWhile the first example suggested reflection that set the originating pixels to\nzero, the additional training examples demonstrate a true reflection where the\noriginal pixels are retained AND a mirrored copy placed in the reflected\nposition.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is to:\n\n1.  **Correct the Reflection Logic:** Modify the code to retain the original\n    pixels. The `if (new_row != row): output_grid[row,col] = 0` needs to be\n    removed.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML and natural language program to\n    accurately describe the reflection as a copying action that duplicates\n    non-white pixels across the horizontal midline, while retaining the originals.\n\n**Example and Results Analysis**\n\nTo provide accurate reports, I'll use a hypothetical `code_execution` environment (since I don't have direct execution capabilities) to describe the expected metrics. I'll structure the analysis as if I've executed the code on each example.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3\n    *   Original non-white pixels: 1 (at position (0,1), value = 8)\n    *   Reflected non-white pixels (current code): 1 (at position (2,1), value=8)\n    *   Reflected non-white pixels (correct): 2, at (0,1) and (2,1) both value=8\n    *   Errors: Incorrect reflection logic. Missing original pixel value at (0,1)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x5\n    *   Output Shape: 5x5\n    *   Original non-white pixels: 2.  (1,1)=blue; (3,3)=red\n    *   Reflected non-white pixels (current code): 2 (1,1)=0; (3,3)=0;\n        (3,1)=blue; (1,3)=red\n    *   Reflected non-white pixels (correct): 4, at (1,1) and (3,1)=blue; (3,3)\n        and (1,3)=red\n    *   Errors: Incorrect reflection logic, pixels do not move, they are copied.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *    Input Shape: 7x7\n    *    Output Shape: 7x7\n    *    Original non-white pixels: 4.  (1,2)=1; (2,3)=2; (4,3)=2; (5,2)=1\n    *    Reflected non-white pixels (current code): 4 (1,2)=0; (2,3)=0;(4,3)=0;\n        (5,2)=0; (5,2)=1; (4,3)=2;(2,3)=2,(1,2)=1\n    *   Reflected non-white pixels (correct): 8. (1,2)=1; (2,3)=2; (4,3)=2;\n        (5,2)=1; (5,2)=1; (4,3)=2;(2,3)=2,(1,2)=1\n    *    Errors: Incorrect reflection logic.\n\n**YAML Documentation**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: Vertical Reflection\n    objects:\n      - name: grid\n        properties:\n          - height: varies (3, 5, 7 in examples)\n          - width: varies (3, 5, 7 in examples)\n          - cells: contain color values (0-9)\n      - name: non-white pixels\n        properties:\n          - color: not white (not 0)\n          - position: (row, column)\n        actions:\n          - type: reflection\n            description: >\n              Each non-white pixel is copied to a vertically reflected position across the horizontal midline.\n              The original pixel remains unchanged.\n  - task: Vertical Reflection (detailed)\n    objects_and_actions:\n      input_grid:\n        properties:\n          - shape: [H, W]\n          - cells: pixels with color values 0-9.  0 represents white.\n        related_objects:\n          non_white_pixel:\n            properties:\n              - color: not 0.\n              - position: [row, column]\n            actions_performed:\n              vertical_reflection:\n                description: >\n                  The pixel is copied to a new location.

For each non-white pixel in the input grid, a copy of that pixel is placed in the output grid at the vertically mirrored position. The original, non-white, pixel is retained in its original location. White pixels (value 0) are unaffected. The horizontal midline is conceptually located at (height - 1) / 2. The reflected position's row is calculated as `height - 1 - original_row`, and the column remains the same.\n\nExample:\nInput:\n\n```\n0 8 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nCorrect Output:\n\n```\n0 8 0\n0 0 0\n0 8 0\n```\n\nInput\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n```\n\nCorrect Output\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n```\n"
