        properties:
          - height: varies (3, 5, 7 in examples)
          - width: varies (3, 5, 7 in examples)
          - cells: contain color values (0-9)
      - name: non-white pixels
        properties:
          - color: not white (not 0)
          - position: (row, column)

              Each non-white pixel is copied to a vertically reflected position across the horizontal midline.
              The original pixel remains unchanged.

                  The destination location's row is calculated as (H - 1 - original_row)
                  The destination column is unchanged.
                result:
                  - The pixel now also exists at the reflected location.
