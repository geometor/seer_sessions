Okay, I'm ready to analyze the input-output pair and provide my observations.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.
*   Most of the grid cells are 0 (white).
*   There are a few non-zero colored cells scattered throughout the grid.
*   The non-zero colors appear to be the same in both input and output (maroon-9, green-3, azure-8, orange-7).
*   The positions of the non-zero colored cells are different between the input and output.
* The non-zero colors move down and to the left.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: integers (0-9)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
        3: green
        4: yellow
        5: gray
        6: magenta
        7: orange
        8: azure
        9: maroon
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: move
    description: Non-zero pixels move diagonally down-left, potentially stacking on other non-zero pixels of a different original color.

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains colored_pixels
  - output_grid: contains colored_pixels
  - colored_pixels: shifted positions between input and output

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-zero (colored) pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each non-zero pixel, shift its position diagonally down and to the left.
    * The maroon (9) pixels shift down one, and to the left zero
    * The azure (8) pixels shifts down one and to the left one for each row it is below the previouse 8 or 9.
    * The orange (7) pixles shifts down one and to the left one for each row it is below the previous 7, 8, or 9.
3.  If multiple pixels would occupy the same cell after the shift, maintain all
    pixels in the cell.
4. Create the output grid with cells having the described values.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
