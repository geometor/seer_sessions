Here's a breakdown of my observations, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 2D grids of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The transformation seems to involve a specific pattern of replicating non-zero pixels vertically, creating columns of the same color. The zero-value pixels (white) act as a background and are not directly involved in the primary transformation, but get pushed aside or overwritten.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

They do not change actively but may be overwritten by the replicating non-zero pixels.\n\nIn short: Every non-zero pixel becomes the \"seed\" for a column of the same color, extending downwards as far as possible.\n"
