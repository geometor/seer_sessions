Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a vertical reflection (mirroring) of non-white pixels. Non-white pixels in the input grid are repositioned in the output grid such that their horizontal position remains the same, but their vertical position is mirrored across the horizontal midline of the grid. White pixels remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the vertical reflection transformation code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a vertical reflection, but it clears the source
pixel after moving, turning the reflection into more of a move/translation to
a mirrored position, setting the origination to zero.

While the first example suggested reflection that set the originating pixels to
zero, the additional training examples demonstrate a true reflection where the
original pixels are retained AND a mirrored copy placed in the reflected
position.

The strategy to resolve the errors is to:

1.  **Correct the Reflection Logic:** Modify the code to retain the original
    pixels. The `if (new_row != row): output_grid[row,col] = 0` needs to be
    removed.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML and natural language program to
    accurately describe the reflection as a copying action that duplicates
    non-white pixels across the horizontal midline, while retaining the originals.

**Example and Results Analysis**

To provide accurate reports, I'll use a hypothetical `code_execution` environment (since I don't have direct execution capabilities) to describe the expected metrics. I'll structure the analysis as if I've executed the code on each example.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Output Shape: 3x3
    *   Original non-white pixels: 1 (at position (0,1), value = 8)
    *   Reflected non-white pixels (current code): 1 (at position (2,1), value=8)
    *   Reflected non-white pixels (correct): 2, at (0,1) and (2,1) both value=8
    *   Errors: Incorrect reflection logic. Missing original pixel value at (0,1)
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x5
    *   Output Shape: 5x5
    *   Original non-white pixels: 2.  (1,1)=blue; (3,3)=red
    *   Reflected non-white pixels (current code): 2 (1,1)=0; (3,3)=0;
        (3,1)=blue; (1,3)=red
    *   Reflected non-white pixels (correct): 4, at (1,1) and (3,1)=blue; (3,3)
        and (1,3)=red
    *   Errors: Incorrect reflection logic, pixels do not move, they are copied.
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input Shape: 7x7
    *    Output Shape: 7x7
    *    Original non-white pixels: 4.  (1,2)=1; (2,3)=2; (4,3)=2; (5,2)=1
    *    Reflected non-white pixels (current code): 4 (1,2)=0; (2,3)=0;(4,3)=0;
        (5,2)=0; (5,2)=1; (4,3)=2;(2,3)=2,(1,2)=1
    *   Reflected non-white pixels (correct): 8. (1,2)=1; (2,3)=2; (4,3)=2;
        (5,2)=1; (5,2)=1; (4,3)=2;(2,3)=2,(1,2)=1
    *    Errors: Incorrect reflection logic.

                result:
                  - The pixel now also exists at the reflected location.

```

**Natural Language Program**

The transformation rule performs a vertical reflection of all non-white pixels across the horizontal midline of the grid. For each non-white pixel in the input grid, a copy of that pixel is placed in the output grid at the vertically mirrored position. The original, non-white, pixel is retained in its original location. White pixels (value 0) are unaffected. The horizontal midline is conceptually located at (height - 1) / 2. The reflected position's row is calculated as `height - 1 - original_row`, and the column remains the same.

Example:
Input:

```
0 8 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

Correct Output:

```
0 8 0
0 0 0
0 8 0
```

Input

```
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0 0

```

Correct Output

```
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0 0

```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
