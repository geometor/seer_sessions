facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids are the same size (10x10).
  - objects:
      - name: Non-zero pixels
        properties:
          - color: Defined by integer value (1-9, excluding 0)
          - initial_position: Original (row, column) in input grid
        actions:
          - replicate_vertically: Create copies of itself in the same column.
      - name: Zero pixels
        properties:
         - color: white (0)
        actions:
          - passive:  Act as background.
  - transformation_rule: |
      Non-zero pixels are replicated vertically downwards, filling their respective columns.
      The replication stops when it reaches the bottom of the grid or another non-zero pixel.
  - spatial_context:
      - type: 2D grid
      - dimensions: rows x columns
      - boundaries: Edges of the grid.
