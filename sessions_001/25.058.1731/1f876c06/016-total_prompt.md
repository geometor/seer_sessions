Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, where most pixels are white (0) and some have other colors (representing digits 1-9). The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the non-white pixels, suggesting a spatial transformation or permutation. The size of the grid remains constant (10x10).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**

  - type: grid

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (value 0).

2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.

3.  **Preserve Order:** maintain the original relative position of the non-white pixels, as read top to bottom, left to right.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
