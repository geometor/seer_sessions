Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule performs a vertical reflection of all non-white pixels across the horizontal midline of the grid. For each non-white pixel in the input grid, a copy of that pixel is placed in the output grid at the vertically mirrored position. The original, non-white, pixel is retained in its original location. White pixels (value 0) are unaffected. The horizontal midline is conceptually located at (height - 1) / 2. The reflected position's row is calculated as `height - 1 - original_row`, and the column remains the same.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies a vertical reflection transformation, copying non-white pixels across the horizontal midline.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    height = output_grid.shape[0]

    # Iterate through the input grid to find non-white pixels.
    for row in range(height):
        for col in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[row, col] != 0:
                # Calculate the new row index for vertical reflection.
                new_row = height - 1 - row
                # Copy the pixel to the reflected position in the output grid.
                output_grid[new_row, col] = input_grid[row, col]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine the natural language program and address any discrepancies.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code describe a vertical reflection of non-white pixels across the horizontal midline, while keeping the original pixels. The provided code seems to correctly implement this initial description. However, a complete evaluation must review the test results across the entire training set to look for errors and edge cases. The strategy will be:

1.  **Analyze Results:** Execute the provided `transform` function on each training input and compare the output with the expected output. Record any differences.
2.  **Identify Patterns in Errors:** If errors exist, categorize them. Are they related to specific colors, shapes, positions, or grid sizes? Do they affect some of the test cases and not others?
3.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program to reflect a more accurate description, and the YAML file of facts, incorporating the observations and error analysis.
4.  **Iterate:** Repeat as necessary, using test results from the generated code to refine the descriptions, in particular the YAML and natural language descriptions.

**Metrics and Observations**

To help with metric collection and comparison, I'll define a helper function to compare grids. I will execute this within a `tool_code` block for organization. This code checks each training example.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """Compares two grids and returns a dictionary of differences."""
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return {'shape_mismatch': True, 'grid1_shape': grid1.shape, 'grid2_shape': grid2.shape, 'differences': []}

    differences = []
    for row in range(grid1.shape[0]):
        for col in range(grid1.shape[1]):
            if grid1[row, col] != grid2[row, col]:
                differences.append({'row': row, 'col': col, 'grid1_value': grid1[row, col], 'grid2_value': grid2[row, col]})
    return {'shape_mismatch': False, 'differences': differences}

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
