Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels, where most pixels are white (0) and some have other colors (representing digits 1-9). The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the non-white pixels, suggesting a spatial transformation or permutation. The size of the grid remains constant (10x10).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (value 0).

2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.

3.  **Preserve Order:** maintain the original relative position of the non-white pixels, as read top to bottom, left to right.
