For each non-white pixel in the input grid, a copy of that pixel is placed in the output grid at the vertically mirrored position. The original, non-white, pixel is retained in its original location. White pixels (value 0) are unaffected. The horizontal midline is conceptually located at (height - 1) / 2. The reflected position's row is calculated as `height - 1 - original_row`, and the column remains the same.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a vertical reflection transformation, copying non-white pixels across the horizontal midline.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    height = output_grid.shape[0]\n\n    # Iterate through the input grid to find non-white pixels.\n    for row in range(height):\n        for col in range(output_grid.shape[1]):\n            if input_grid[row, col] != 0:\n                # Calculate the new row index for vertical reflection.\n                new_row = height - 1 - row\n                # Copy the pixel to the reflected position in the output grid.\n                output_grid[new_row, col] = input_grid[row, col]\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
