Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Find all non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Move:** Shift the position of each colored (non-zero) pixel diagonally. The number of positions shifted corresponds to the value of the pixel. The movement direction depends on the original column:
    *   If the pixel's original column index is greater than or equal to the row index, the pixel moves diagonally down and to the *left*.
    *   If the pixel's original column index is less that the row index, the pixel moves diagonally down and to the *right*.
3.  **Output:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input. Place each shifted pixel in its new position on the output grid, retaining its original color. Pixels that would be shifted outside the grid boundaries disappear.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
