Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule performs a vertical reflection of all non-white pixels across the horizontal midline of the grid. For each non-white pixel in the input grid, a copy of that pixel is placed in the output grid at the vertically mirrored position. The original, non-white, pixel is retained in its original location. White pixels (value 0) are unaffected. The horizontal midline is conceptually located at (height - 1) / 2. The reflected position's row is calculated as `height - 1 - original_row`, and the column remains the same.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies a vertical reflection transformation, copying non-white pixels across the horizontal midline.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    height = output_grid.shape[0]

    # Iterate through the input grid to find non-white pixels.
    for row in range(height):
        for col in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            if input_grid[row, col] != 0:
                # Calculate the new row index for vertical reflection.
                new_row = height - 1 - row
                # Copy the pixel to the reflected position in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
