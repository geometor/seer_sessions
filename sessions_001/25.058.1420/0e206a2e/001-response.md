Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, focusing on perceiving the underlying logic and expressing it in a structured way.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids (matrices) where each cell contains a single digit integer representing a color. The transformation appears to involve repositioning, and potentially combining or modifying, colored objects within the grid. There's a strong sense of "objectness," where contiguous blocks of the same color are treated as single units.  Empty areas (color 0) seem to serve as background and are generally preserved, although their arrangement can change. The transformation is not a simple rotation, reflection, or translation of the entire grid.  Instead, specific colored objects are moved or altered. There are often multiple objects of different colors, and their relative positions might be important, though the examples so far suggest otherwise. It seems parts are *moved*, and sometimes expanded, but not rotated.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: colored_block
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      shape: contiguous_pixels
      position: (row, column)
    actions:
      - moved
      - expanded

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: [colored_block, colored_block]
  - type: background
    between: [colored_block, empty_space]
  - type: within_output
    between: [colored_block, colored_block]
      details: in some cases, parts of colored blocks in the input are combined and moved in the output
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels in the input grid. Each block is a separate object.
2. **Object motion/expansion:** in the first example, the azure (8) colored block is moved down and right. Some yellow (4) and green (3) blocks are moved, as are blue(1) and red(2).
3. **Expansion**: in the second example, the green object is moved to the lower right corner, and expands to include new green pixels along its edges. The red object is moved with it and also changes position.
4. **Combine**: In the third example, we have another example of objects being moved to the bottom right.

Overall, all non-zero colored objects or parts of objects in the input grid, are moved to combine at the bottom right of the output grid, maintaining their relative positions to each other when possible, and expanding where needed. The rest of the output grid remains filled with zeros (background).
