The transformation seems to involve repositioning and potentially modifying some of the non-zero colored pixels within the grid, while leaving most of the zero-valued (white) pixels unchanged. There appears to be a focus on moving clusters of pixels. The relative positions of colors within a connected cluster change position and swap.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
