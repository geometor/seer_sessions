"""
The transformation rule involves identifying single-pixel colors (blue, red, yellow)
and a connected azure cluster in the input grid. The positions of these single
pixels are maintained in the output grid. The azure cluster is moved to a
new position, with the movement rule being complex and input-dependent. It appears
the cluster is moved near to other objects while maintaining it's shape.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
