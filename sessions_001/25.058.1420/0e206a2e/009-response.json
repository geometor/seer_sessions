The configuration of colored pixels is related to the configuration in the input.\n*   **Colors:**  The relevant colors appear to be blue (1), red (2), green (3), and yellow (4).\n*   **Shapes:** There are isolated single-pixel colors, and a larger green (3) object which is connected.\n*.  **Object Transformation:** The core of the transformation appears to be moving and restructuring the colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

            "text": "\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-white (non-zero) pixels. Group contiguous pixels of the same color into single objects. Note each unique object and their colors.\n\n2.  **Determine a Reference Object and its Movement:** Identify the largest object by pixel count. The object will move to the second to last row. The other pixels' movements will be calculated relative to the movement of this object. In this case, it is the Green '3' object. Calculate the transformation (change in row and change in column) required to get the bottom-most and left-most point of the green object to row 11, column 10.\n\n3.  **Move other colored pixel:** For each colored object, move each pixel to the output grid using the row and column transformation from Step 2.\n\n4.  **Reconstruct:** Fill an empty grid with the colors of the moved objects in the output grid.\n\nIn summary, the rule involves identifying colored objects, using a large 'green' object as reference, and transposing that object to near the bottom of the output, maintaining its shape, and transposing other pixels. The locations for all non-white pixels change by adding 7 to their row index and adding 6 to their column index.\n"
