Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing digits representing colors. The primary observation is a rearrangement and, in some cases, an apparent duplication or spreading of colored pixels. The background remains unchanged (filled with 0s, or white). Specifically, there's a cluster of azure (8) pixels in the input, and a somewhat mirrored cluster of azure pixels in the output. Other colored pixels (blue, red, yellow) seem to trigger the placement or serve as "anchors" or "seeds" from the original cluster is then spread.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 16x14 (rows x columns)
      elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)

  - type: pixel_cluster
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: irregular, but somewhat connected in the example input,
             irregular connected in output,
      movement: transposed and possibly duplicated relative to other colored pixels

  - type: single_pixels
    properties:
       colors: blue(1), red(2), yellow(4),
       shape: single cell
       movement: position appears to be the point from which the new azure shape originates,

actions:
  - type: translate
    description: The azure cluster's position shifts relative to other single colored pixels.
  - type: duplication_along_axis
    description: the original set of connected azure pixels is duplicated

relationships:
  - description: The blue, red and yellow pixels' positions are maintained, and the azure cluster's position in the input grid is the source for transformation of the positions of pixels in the cluster.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the single blue (1), red (2), and yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. Note their original positions.
2.  **Identify Source Cluster:** Find the connected cluster of azure (8) pixels in the *input* grid.
3. **Translate:** use the positions of the blue, red and yellow pixels to define an origin point on the output grid.
4.  **Duplicate/Mirror**: Duplicate the shape of the source cluster.

In summary, the single pixels serve as positional references to the input azure cluster. The process involves taking the shape of the input azure cluster and moving/duplicating it based on the locations of the single pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
