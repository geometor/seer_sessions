The output is a smaller grid containing only white (0) and yellow (4). The output grid appears to be a cropped and condensed version of a section of the input grid. It seems like a specific region of interest related to color '4' from the input is selected, and some surrounding white pixels are also retained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
