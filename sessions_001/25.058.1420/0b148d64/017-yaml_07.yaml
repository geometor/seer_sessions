example_1:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: bottom-left}
    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: background, position: surrounds object_1 and object_2}
  output_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: fills output}
    - object_2: {color: white, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1}
  transformations:
    - Select the bottom left region of yellow.
    - Select all contiguous non yellow colors until reaching a non-white or non-blue.
    - Remove blue from within the selection.
    - Output is the resulting sub-grid.

example_2:
  input_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: bottom-left}
    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: background, position: surrounds object_1 and object_2}
  output_objects:
    - object_1: {color: yellow, shape: irregular, position: fills output}
    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: bottom}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1 and above object_2}
  transformations:
    - Select the bottom left region of yellow.
    - Select all contiguous non yellow colors until reaching a non-white or non-blue.
    - Output is the resulting sub-grid.

    - object_2: {color: blue, shape: irregular, position: bottom}
    - object_3: {color: white, shape: irregular, position: surrounds object_1 and above object_2}
  transformations:
    - Select the bottom left region of yellow.
