facts:
  - object_identification:
      - "A single contiguous object of a specific color exists in each input grid, surrounded by a background of color 0."
      - "The color of the target object varies across examples (red, blue, yellow)."
      -  "The background is always color 0 (white)."
  - object_properties:
      - "The target object is always a rectangle."
      - "The object's dimensions are always divisible by 2."
      - "There is an area outside of the target shape defined by the value 8, this is discarded"

  - actions:
      - "Cropping: A bounding box is determined for the target object."
      - "Resizing: The bounding box is resized to half its original height and width."
      - "Color Preservation: The color of the target object is maintained during the transformation."
      - "Discarding: all pixels with value 8 are not considered as part of the solution"
