Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the contiguous region of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. It is at the bottom left.
2.  **Define Extraction Boundaries:** Determine a rectangular boundary around the yellow region. It appears to be expanded to encompass the entire yellow area.
3. **Extract Sub-Grid**: from the coordinates of the bounding box created, copy the contents
4.  **Filter Colors:** Within this extracted region, keep only the yellow (4) and white (0) pixels. Remove all blue (1) pixels.
5.  **Form Output:** The resulting filtered sub-grid becomes the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extracting a region of yellow and white pixels, removing blue pixels within that region. However, the subsequent training examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The code correctly extracts a subgrid but doesn't handle all color filtering or object interactions correctly. The core issue seems to be an oversimplification of the color filtering rule, as shown in examples 2 & 3 the blue remains.

My strategy to resolve these errors involves the following steps:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the colors present, their spatial arrangement, and how they change.
2.  **Object and Relationship Identification**: catalog objects and their properties.
3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the example analysis, adjust the initial hypothesis (natural language program) to account for the observed variations. Specifically, refine rules for color changes.
4.  **Code Modification Planning:** Translate the refined hypothesis into specific code changes. This involves planning how to modify the existing functions or add new ones to achieve the desired transformation.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics gathered via observation.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 10x10, Colors: Yellow, Blue, White
    *   Output: 6x5, Colors: Yellow, White
    *   Observations: The code correctly extracted the yellow region and removed the blue.
    *   `Assessment: PASS`

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 11x10, Colors: Yellow, Blue, White
    *   Output: 7x5, Colors: Yellow, Blue, White
    *   Observations: Code extracts the yellow and white region, but the blue is set to white, not maintained.
    *   `Assessment: FAIL`

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: 10x10, Colors: Yellow, Blue, White
    *    Output: 7x5, Colors: Yellow, White, Blue
    *    Observations: Code extracts the yellow and white region, the blue is set to white, not maintained.
    *   `Assessment: FAIL`

  transformations:
    - Select the bottom left region of yellow.
    - Select all contiguous non yellow colors until reaching a non-white or non-blue.
    - Remove blue from within the selection.
    - Output is the resulting sub-grid.

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the contiguous region of yellow (4) pixels in the input grid. It is at the bottom-left.
2.  **Define Extraction Boundaries:** Determine a rectangular boundary around the yellow region. Expand the region to contain contiguous white or blue pixels.
3.  **Extract Sub-Grid:** from the coordinates of the bounding box created, copy the contents.
4.  **Form Output:** The resulting sub-grid becomes the output grid.

Essentially the update is to include the contiguous blue and white region - but no other colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
