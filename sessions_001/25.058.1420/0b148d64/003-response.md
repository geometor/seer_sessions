Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (21x21) composed of mostly azure (8), white (0), and red (2) pixels.  The azure and white pixels seem to form a background, while the red pixels create a distinct shape in the lower portion of the grid. The output grid is smaller (10x10) and consists only of red (2) and white (0) pixels. The output appears to be a cropped and condensed version of the red shape from the input. The azure pixels are completely removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 21x21
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        role: background
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
      - color: red (2)
        role: foreground_shape
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: red (2)
        role: foreground_shape
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
  - action: cropping
    description: Selecting a sub-region of the input grid.
  - action: color_filtering
    description: Removing all azure pixels.
  - relationship: output_is_cropped_input
    description: The output grid is a cropped and color-filtered version of the input grid, containing only the red shape.
  - observation: output grid size
    description: the dimensions are reduced by about half (21 -> 10)

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify the foreground shape:** Locate the contiguous region of red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2. **Isolate Input region:** define a region that contains only colors 0 and 2 (white and red).
3. **Crop:**  Create a bounding box around the red shape. I will refer to this box as B.
4. **Remove background:** remove all azure (8) pixels. The box, B, contains only red and white pixels.
5.  **Resize:** reduce the height and width of the bounding box, B, by half, rounding down.
6. **Output:** The resulting cropped, filtered, and resized grid is the output.
