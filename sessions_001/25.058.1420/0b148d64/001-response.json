The input grids are larger and contain a horizontal dividing line of black (0) pixels separating two distinct regions.  Above the line are seemingly random arrangements of colors.  Below the line is a region with one prominent color forming a shape.  The output grids are smaller, cropped versions of the lower region, specifically focusing on the shape defined by the prominent, non-black color. The other colors in that bottom region are replaced by black in the output.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

The region of interest is the one *below* this line.\n\n2. **Identify Shape:** Within the region of interest, determine the most frequent non-black color. This color defines the \"shape\". All contiguous pixels of this color constitute the shape.\n\n3. **Crop:** Determine the smallest bounding box that completely encloses the shape found in step 2. This bounding box acts as the cropping area.\n\n4. **Recolor:** Create the output grid. This will have size of the bounding box in the step 3. Copy all pixels within the bounding box from the input region to output grid.\n\n5. **Final Recoloring**. Within this cropped grid, replace all pixels that are *not* the shape's color with black (0). The final result will be a 2 color grid.\n\nIn short - find region of interest under black horizontal divider, isolate prominent shape within it, crop to shape, then recolor with the rest as background of black.\n"
