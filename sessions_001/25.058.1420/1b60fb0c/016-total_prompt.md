Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The input grid contains only 0s (white) and 1s (blue).
*   The output grid contains 0s (white), 1s (blue), and 2s (red).
*   The 1s (blue) in the input grid appear to be preserved in the output grid in the same locations.
*   The 2s (red) in the output grid seem to be related to the 0s (white) that are adjacent to, or specifically to the left of, a group of 1s in the input. It appears 2 is filling white pixels, but only some of them.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 10x10
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: [0, 1, 2]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      colors:
        0: white
        1: blue
        2: red
      adjacency:
        types: [horizontal, vertical, diagonal]
actions:
    - name: fill
      agent: system
      target: pixel, type 0 and adjacent to the left of a type 1
      result: change pixel, type 0 becomes type 2
relationships:
  - subject: output grid
    relation: same dimensions as
    object: input grid
  - subject: blue pixel
    relation: location preserved
    object: input and output grids
  - subject: red pixels output grid
    relation: fills white pixels
    object: some input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Blue:** Copy all blue pixels (value 1) from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their exact positions.

2.  **Identify Target Whites:**
    Locate all of the white pixels in the Input.
    Check if a white pixel has any blue to its right (horizontal adjacency).

3.  **Fill with Red:** Change the color of target white pixels to red (value 2). The pattern that I see if the entire left most "column" within a contiguous shape of 1s.

4. All other pixels remain white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
