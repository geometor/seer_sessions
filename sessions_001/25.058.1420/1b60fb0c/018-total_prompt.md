1. Preserve Blue: Copy all blue pixels (value 1) from the input grid to the output grid, maintaining their exact positions.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified a key aspect of the transformation: turning some white pixels red based on the proximity of blue pixels. However, it's overly simplistic and only considers immediate horizontal adjacency (to the left of blue). The test results reveal that the rule is more complex, involving a concept of the "left-most" white pixel in a sequence leading up to a blue pixel, potentially spanning multiple cells. The initial code fails to fully capture this "left-most" condition and stops checking when the first white pixel is to the left of the blue pixel. The other examples show that the relationship is a bit more complex than first perceived, and the transformation rule depends on multiple features.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Improve "Left-most" Logic:** The core issue is the inaccurate identification of the white pixels to be turned red. The code needs to scan to check for "left-most" white pixels.

2.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Make sure no "out of bounds" errors can happen, even if checking for edge cases is not currently needed.

3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Use the provided training examples to iteratively refine the natural language program and code. Each example provides additional information about the rule.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: blue_pixel
    value: 1
    property: invariant  # Blue pixels do not change.
    action: serves_as_marker  # For identifying white pixels.

  - object: white_pixel
    value: 0
    property: conditionally_variant  # White pixels may or may not change.
    action: potentially_changes_to_red

  - object: red_pixel
    value: 2
    property: result_of_transformation
    action: appears_based_on_rule

  - rule: transformation_condition
    description: "White pixels become red if they are the left-most white pixel in a contiguous horizontal sequence of white pixels directly to the left of a blue pixel."
    details: "The sequence must be uninterrupted by other colors. The left-most condition signifies the furthest white pixel to the left that satisfies the condition. All other pixels remain unchanged."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Blue Pixels:** Copy all blue pixels (value 1) from the input grid to the output grid without any changes to their position or value.

2.  **Identify Left-most White Pixels:** For each row, scan from left to right. Identify contiguous sequences of white pixels (value 0) that are immediately followed by a blue pixel (value 1). Within each such sequence, only the left-most white pixel is selected.

3.  **Change to Red:** Change the color of the selected left-most white pixels to red (value 2).

4. **Preserve other Pixels:** All other pixels that are not blue or identified as the "left-most" white pixels remain with their input value.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
