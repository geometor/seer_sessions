observations:
  - task: "Horizontal color change based on adjacency"
  - objects:
      - type: "pixel"
        properties:
          color: [white, blue, red] # Possible color values
          position: [row, column]  # 2D coordinates
  - relationships:
      - type: "horizontal_adjacency" #Describes the key relationship
        conditions:
          - "A white pixel is to the left of a blue pixel within the same row."
  - actions:
      - type: "color_change"
        trigger: "horizontal_adjacency"
        from_color: "white"
        to_color: "red"
        scope: "All white pixels to the left of the left-most blue pixel in a given row are changed."
  - constraints:
    - type: "row_specific"
      description: "The color change rule applies independently to each row."
