    description: "White pixels become red if they are the left-most white pixel in a contiguous horizontal sequence of white pixels directly to the left of a blue pixel."
    details: "The sequence must be uninterrupted by other colors. The left-most condition signifies the furthest white pixel to the left that satisfies the condition. All other pixels remain unchanged."
