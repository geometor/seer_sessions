The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2). The input grid seems to contain a shape made of blue (1) pixels against a white (0) background. The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific part, region or sub-shape within the blue shape and changing its color to red.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
