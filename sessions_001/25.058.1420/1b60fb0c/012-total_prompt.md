Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the blue (1) shape:** Find all contiguous blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Locate the sub-shape:** Identify the leftmost vertical contiguous block of the blue shape, only when at that 'x' coordinate, it is surrounded by white pixels on the top and on the bottom and by three of the left side.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of this leftmost segment to red (2).
4. All other pixels remain the same color.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the core concept of finding a specific part of a blue shape and changing its color. However, the initial definition of the "sub-shape" was too restrictive and based on limited observations from the first example pair. The code must generalize better across all examples. The additional examples highlight the need to be more flexible in locating the section to modify. The program incorrectly identified the target sub-shape when surrounded by colored pixels.

The testing results clearly show the initial assumption that a solid 3-pixel block to the left of the vertical line needs to be white (color 0) is wrong.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine the "sub-shape" definition:** Instead of focusing on what's to the *left* of the line, examine the line itself more closely, how far it extends vertically, and its position relative to other parts of the shape.
2.  **Simplify the surroundings check**: Eliminate the requirement for 3 white pixels to the left. Focus on the top and bottom condition for pixels of the segment being white.
3.  **Iterative Refinement:** Use the execution results to iteratively adjust the conditions for identifying the sub-shape.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To get precise metrics, I'll describe what's happening in each example and use the code to produce comparison.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** A blue 'U' shape.
    *   **Expected Output:** The leftmost vertical line of the 'U' is red.
    *   **Actual Output:** Correct.
    *   **Metrics:**
        ```python
        import numpy as np

        input_grid = np.array([
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,1,1,1,1,1,0],
            [0,1,0,0,0,1,0],
            [0,1,0,0,0,1,0],
            [0,1,1,1,1,1,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
        ])
        expected_output = np.array([
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,2,1,1,1,1,0],
            [0,2,0,0,0,1,0],
            [0,2,0,0,0,1,0],
            [0,2,1,1,1,1,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
        ])
        actual_output = transform(input_grid)
        print(f"Correct: {np.array_equal(actual_output, expected_output)}")
        print(f"Differences:\n{actual_output - expected_output}")

        ```

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** A blue shape resembling a distorted 'E'.
    *   **Expected Output:** The leftmost vertical line of the 'E' is red.
    *   **Actual Output:** Correct.
        ```python
        import numpy as np

        input_grid = np.array([
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0],
            [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0],
            [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
        ])
        expected_output = np.array([
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,2,1,1,1,1,0,0],
            [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,2,1,1,1,1,0,0],
            [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,2,1,1,1,1,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
        ])
        actual_output = transform(input_grid)
        print(f"Correct: {np.array_equal(actual_output, expected_output)}")
        print(f"Differences:\n{actual_output - expected_output}")
        ```

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** A blue 'L' shape with a magenta pixel to the left of the vertical.
    *   **Expected Output:** The leftmost vertical line of the 'L' is red.
    *   **Actual Output:** Incorrect. The leftmost vertical line is not changed to red, due to the original surrounding test.
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    input_grid = np.array([
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,6,1,1,1,0],
        [0,0,6,1,0,0,0],
        [0,0,6,1,0,0,0],
        [0,0,6,1,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    ])
    expected_output = np.array([
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,6,2,1,1,0],
        [0,0,6,2,0,0,0],
        [0,0,6,2,0,0,0],
        [0,0,6,2,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    ])
    actual_output = transform(input_grid)
    print(f"Correct: {np.array_equal(actual_output, expected_output)}")
    print(f"Differences:\n{actual_output - expected_output}")
    ```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: blue_shape
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: varies (U, E, L, etc.)
      - description:  The main shape that needs to be analyzed.
    actions:
      - identify_subshape
      - change_color

  - object: subshape
    properties:
      - color: blue (1) initially, then red (2)
      - shape: vertical_line
      - description: The leftmost, continuous, vertical segment of the blue_shape, where top and bottom adjacent pixels are not blue.
    actions:
      - change_color:
          from: blue (1)
          to: red (2)

  - object: other_pixels
    properties:
      - color: any
      - shape: any
      - description: All pixels not part of the identified subshape.
    actions:
      - remain_same
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find the Blue Shape:** Identify the contiguous blue (1) region, which forms the main shape.
2.  **Identify Leftmost Vertical Segment:** Within the blue shape, find the leftmost vertical segment. A vertical segment is defined as a contiguous set of blue pixels where the pixel immediately above and below are not blue.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of this identified leftmost vertical segment to red (2).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid retain their original colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
