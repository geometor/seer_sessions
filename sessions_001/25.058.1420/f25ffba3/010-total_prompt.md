Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), green (3), and azure (8). The input grid transforms into the output grid, suggesting a manipulation of the pixel positions or a re-arrangement based on some rule. It looks like a reflection or mirroring of some part of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input and output grids have the same dimensions (10x4).
  - object: column_of_2s:
      properties:
        color: red (2)
        location: rightmost column
        description: A vertical line of red pixels.
  - object: colored_pixels:
      properties:
        colors: green (3), azure (8)
        location: variable, concentrated on the bottom left of input and top left and bottom left of output.
  - action: mirroring:
      description: The top half of the input grid appears to be a mirrored version of the bottom half in output, around horizontal center
  - relationship: The column of red pixels remains constant in position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Elements**: Locate the vertical line of red (2) pixels along the rightmost edge of the grid. This line remains unchanged.

2.  **Mirror the Input Grid**: Imagine taking the input and flipping, or mirroring the bottom half of the non-red(2) pixels to make the top half of the output, and keep the bottom.

3. **Preserve and Combine**: Copy the entire "red_column" and maintain its original position. Merge the mirrored portion with red column to make complete output.

In simpler terms, the transformation takes the bottom half of the grid (excluding red column) and uses it to construct the inverse for the top part of the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
