<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=4112x2738 at 0x7A608C34AB70>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on discerning the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The primary elements are:

*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.
*   **Colors:** Represented by digits 0-9, corresponding to a specific color map (provided in the system prompt).
*   **Spatial Relationships:** Objects have positions within the grid (row, column) and relationships like adjacency (next to) are crucial.
* **Transformation**: duplication and re-coloring based on shape, size and location

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - task_id: "example_task"
  - objects:
    - description: "Colored rectangular shapes or single pixels"
      properties:
        - color: "[0-9]"
        - shape: "rectangle, single pixel, or other contiguous shapes"
        - size: "variable, defined by width and height"
        - position: "[row, column]"
  - actions:
    - name: "Duplicate"
      description: "Create a copy of an object."
      parameters:
        - object: "target object to duplicate"
    - name: "Translate and Duplicate"
      description: "Move a copy to a different part of the output grid."
    - name: "Recolor"
      description: "change colors and expand the objects"
      parameters:

  - relationships:
      - type: "adjacency"
        description: "Objects can be adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically or diagonally"
      - type: position
        description: relative position of an object, especially after translation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all distinct contiguous colored regions (objects) in the input grid.
2.  **Duplicate and Re-Color:**
    *   Duplicate the identified colored objects.
    *   In the first example, the azure (8) object is duplicated and stays the same color and size. The green (3) object is duplicated and expanded. The expansion duplicates each pixel of the green object, so the original line of length three pixels becomes three lines of length three. The red object (2) duplicates into three groups of three. Each groups expands into nine, like the green object.
    *   In the second example the yellow(4) and blue(1) pixels are expanded horizontally to three pixels wide. The red object expands to be length six.
    *   In the third example, the magenta (6) pixels expands horizontally. The grey(5) object is not changed, and the blue (1) object is moved down and then expanded horizontally.

3. **Place Objects**: Put the changed objects into place. It appears some objects move before expanding and some expand before moving.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
