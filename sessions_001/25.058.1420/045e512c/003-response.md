Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The primary colors present are azure (8), green (3), red (2), and white (0). There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve a change in the arrangement and potentially the properties of these shapes. Specifically, the azure object appears to be "overlayed" by a replicated green object, while the red object is replicated and extended vertically.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: azure_object
    color: azure (8)
    shape: 3x3 rectangle
    initial_position: (7,6) # top-left corner
    action: replicated and overlayed by the green
  - id: green_object
    color: green (3)
    shape: single pixel
    initial_position: (7, 10)
    action: replicated, expanded, becomes overlay, pattern of: single, double, single, double, ...
  - id: red_object
    color: red (2)
    shape: 3x3 rectangle
    initial_position: (11,6) #top-left corner
    action: replicated and vertically extended

relationships:
  - type: overlay
    subject: green_object
    object: azure_object
  - type: replication
    subject: azure_object
  - type: replication
    subject: green_object
  - type: replication_extension
    subject: red_object

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate the distinct azure (8), green (3), and red (2) objects in the input grid.
2.  **Replicate Red:** Replicate the original red object multiple times, placing duplicates below the initial object to extend into a longer vertical block of height determined by input grid height.
3. **Overlay Azure with Extended Green** Replicate the single green object and overlay the pattern "single, double, single, double," extending in a vertical block onto the azure.
4.  **Output:** Maintain all white space

The core concept appears to be replicating color blocks and changing how the
blocks of color interact.
