The primary colors present are azure (8), green (3), red (2), and white (0). There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve a change in the arrangement and potentially the properties of these shapes. Specifically, the azure object appears to be \"overlayed\" by a replicated green object, while the red object is replicated and extended vertically.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
