Previous Code:
```python
"""
This program transforms an input grid based on the following rules:

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Each block is considered an object.
2.  **Gray Object Rule:** If an object is composed of gray (5) pixels, leave it unchanged.
3.  **Magenta and Azure Object Rule:**
    *   Locate objects of magenta (6) and azure (1) pixels.
    *   For each of these objects, create two new objects based on extending the base object by one pixel diagonally.
    * For the magenta color, also create an object on top, two pixels away.
    *   Combine these new objects with the original objects to form the output.
4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid by applying these rules, leaving all other (background) pixels unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and, as expected, doesn't generalize perfectly to all training examples. The core idea of identifying objects and extending magenta and azure ones diagonally is partially correct. However, the specific way the extension is implemented, and handling of other colors, need adjustment. The "up two" additional object rule also needs updating.

Here's the strategy:

1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully review each input/output pair, along with the predicted output. Pay close attention to:
    *   Objects that were correctly transformed.
    *   Objects that were incorrectly transformed.
    *   Objects that were missed entirely.
    * Colors that follow special extension rules
    * The relative positions after the object transformations are applied
2.  **Metrics:** For each example, calculate:
    *   The number of objects of each color in the input.
    *   The number of objects of each color in the expected output.
    *   The number of objects of each color in the predicted output.
    *   Pixel-wise accuracy (how many pixels in the predicted output match the expected output).
3.  **Refine Observations:** Update object transformation rules based on *all* training examples, not just the first.
4.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the generalized transformation rule.
5. **Focus on Relationships**: pay attention to positional relationships between objects in the input and how the same objects are located in the output

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution)**

I'll simulate code execution to gather the necessary metrics. In a real environment, this would involve running the `transform` function on each input and comparing the result with the expected output.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example data (replace with actual data from the ARC task)
# Simulating with simplified data for demonstration
# You'd replace this with the real input/output grids for each training example
training_examples = [
    (
        np.array([[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),  # Input 0
        np.array([[1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]),  # Expected Output 0
    ),
    (
        np.array([[0, 0, 6], [0, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0]]),  # Input 1
        np.array([[0, 6, 6], [6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0]]),  # Expected Output 1
    ),
    (
        np.array([[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),  # Input 2
        np.array([[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]),  # Expected Output 2
    ),
 (
        np.array([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],[0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0]]),  # Input 3
        np.array([[0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0],[0, 6, 6, 0, 0], [6, 6, 0, 0, 0]]),  # Expected Output 3

                      output_grid[r,c] = ext_color

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: 1  # Azure
    transformation:
      - type: extend
        direction: down-right
        offset: (1, 1)
  - color: 6  # Magenta
    transformation:
      - type: extend
        direction: down-left
        offset: (1,-1)
  - color: 5 # Gray
    transformation: [] #no change

```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Each block is an object, and we note its color.
2.  **Gray Object Rule:** Objects composed of gray (5) pixels remain unchanged.
3. **Azure Object Rule:**
    *   Locate objects of azure (1) pixels.
    *   For each azure object, create a new object of the same color by extending each pixel of the base object down and to the right by one pixel.
4.  **Magenta Object Rule:**
      * Locate objects of magenta (6) pixels.
      * For each magenta object, create a new object by extending each pixel of the base object by one pixel down and to the left.
5. **Combine:** Combine new objects with any unchanged objects.
6.  **Output:** The output grid consists of the combined objects and background (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
