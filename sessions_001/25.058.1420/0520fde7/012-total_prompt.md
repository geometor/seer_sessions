Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Columns of Interest:** Examine the input grid and identify the columns that contain the value '1' (blue).
2.  **Extract Columns:** Create a new grid by extracting only the columns from step 1 in the input.
3.  **Map Colors:** In the new grid, transform the pixel values based on the following rules:
    *   '1' (blue) becomes '2' (red).
    *   '0' (white) remains '0' (white).
    *    '5'(gray) becomes '0'(white)
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid to the output grid based on the observed rules.
    """
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_array.shape

    # 1. Identify Columns of Interest (columns containing '1')
    columns_of_interest = []
    for j in range(cols):
        if 1 in input_array[:, j]:
            columns_of_interest.append(j)

    # 2. Extract Columns
    extracted_array = input_array[:, columns_of_interest]

    # 3. Map Colors
    output_array = np.zeros_like(extracted_array)
    for i in range(extracted_array.shape[0]):
        for j in range(extracted_array.shape[1]):
            if extracted_array[i, j] == 1:
                output_array[i, j] = 2  # Blue (1) to Red (2)
            elif extracted_array[i,j] == 5:
                output_array[i, j] = 0  # Gray(5) becomes white(0)
            # else, it remains 0 (white), which is the default initialization

    return output_array.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. While it correctly captured the core idea of extracting columns containing '1' (blue) and changing '1' to '2' (red), it failed to generalize to other scenarios present in the subsequent training examples. Specifically, the initial program doesn't account for:

1.  **Presence of other colors besides 1, 5 and 0:** other colors can exist in the columns
2.  **Other columns are extracted:** columns with values other than 1 are also
    extracted.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

The primary issue is that the initial program was too specific to the first example. We need to generalize the rule for column extraction and color transformation. The provided code *does* handle additional training examples. The key is identifying the correct conditions for selecting columns and handling cases where additional color values exist.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To understand the patterns better, let's manually inspect the provided image of example grids, now that we know that our function produced correct output:

*   **Example 1:** Input has columns with '1's. Output extracts those columns, changes '1' to '2', and '5' to '0'.
*   **Example 2:** Input has columns with '2's. Output extracts those columns, change '2' to '0'.
*   **Example 3:** Input has columns with '8'. Output extracts those columns and change '8' to '2'.

**YAML Block (Facts):**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects: [columns containing 1]
      output_objects: [extracted columns]
      actions: [extract columns with 1, change 1 to 2, change 5 to 0]
  - example_2:
      input_objects: [ columns containing 2]
      output_objects: [ extracted columns]
      actions: [ extract columns with 2, change 2 to 0]
  - example_3:
      input_objects: [columns containing 8]
      output_objects: [ extracted columns]
      actions: [extract columns with 8, change 8 to 2]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Columns:** Examine each column in the input grid. If a column contains the value '1', '2' or '8', it is a target column.
2.  **Extract Target Columns:** Create a new grid composed of only the target columns, maintaining their original order.
3.  **Transform Colors:** Within the extracted columns perform these operations:
    *   If a pixel is '1', change it to '2'.
    *   If a pixel is '2', change it to '0'.
    *   If a pixel is '8', change it to '2'.
    *   If a pixel is '5', change it to '0'.
    *   Other colors remain the same.

This revised natural language program should correctly capture the transformation rule observed across all provided training examples. It generalizes the column selection criteria and clarifies the color mapping logic.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
