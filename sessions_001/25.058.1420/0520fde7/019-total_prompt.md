Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Examine each row of the input grid.
2. Count the blue pixels in each row.
3. Create an output grid of size 3x3.
4. For each row in the input, if the count of blue pixels is greater than zero, place a red pixel in the output grid.
    - The red pixel's row will match the input row.
    - The red pixel's x-coordinate will be one less than the number of blue pixels counted.
5. If a row contains zero blue pixels, no red pixel is placed for that row.
6. If all rows contain zero blue pixels, the output grid remains unchanged (all white/zero).

    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
