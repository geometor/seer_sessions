Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain numerical values representing colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), azure (8), and red (2). There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of azure and red pixels. The transformation seems to involve a repositioning or selective removal of parts of these shapes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 11x10 (rows x columns)
      elements: pixels
      colors: [0, 2, 8]  # white, red, azure
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 8 #azure
      initial_position: (1,3) & (2,3) # top left corner of bounding box, and its height and width
      type: rectangle
      rows: 2
      columns: 2
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 2 #red
      initial_position: (6, 3)
      type: irregular
      rows: 3
      columns: 4
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The azure shape is located above the red shape.
actions:
    - type: move
      description: objects appear to move/be erased from certain areas

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate the azure (8) and red (2) shapes within the input grid.
2.  **Erase lower section:** Erase the lower section, starting at row index that matches height of blue object plus one, from the shapes.
3.  **Output:** The output is the modified shape.

In simpler terms - cut the input at row index equal to the heigh of the blue square, starting from top of red shape.
