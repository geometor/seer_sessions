The primary colors observed are red (2) and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve a shift or movement of a specific object within the grid. The overall grid size and shape remain consistent.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The relative structure within itself is maintained. The right-most edge of shifted red block maintains a 1-pixel offset from the blue block. The final position is such that the empty area to the left of the initial red object's position is equal to the position occupied to the right by the move.\n4.  **Background:** All other pixels remain white (0).\n\nEssentially, the program describes a rightward translation of the red object, while the azure object remains fixed, maintaining the background.\n"
