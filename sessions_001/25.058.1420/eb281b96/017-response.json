            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. While it correctly captured some aspects of the transformation, it failed to generalize to all training examples. The primary issue is that the replication logic is too specific, hardcoding the number of replications and, in the first row, varying this based on color. We need a more general rule.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze each example:** Examine the input/output pairs, focusing on how each *row* in the input relates to a corresponding set of rows in the output. We need to identify consistent behavior related to row expansion that apply to all of the input rows.\n2.  **Identify a pattern:** Look for a consistent rule about which rows are expanded and by how much they get expanded. Specifically, pay attention to the row index as a factor that might control replication, instead of relying on specific color or pixel.\n3. **Refactor Description**: Develop a new natural language program, that reflects a generalized row expansion rule that's consistent across *all* examples.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo get accurate metrics, I'll use a helper function to analyze each example and determine the expansion factor for each row.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_row_expansion(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the row expansion between input and output grids.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid (list of lists).\n        output_grid: The output grid (list of lists).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of expansion factors, one for each row in the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)\n    input_height = input_grid.shape[0]\n    output_height = output_grid.shape[0]\n\n    expansion_factors = []\n    output_row_index = 0\n    for input_row_index in range(input_height):\n        expansion_count = 0\n        while output_row_index < output_height and np.array_equal(output_grid[output_row_index], input_grid[input_row_index]):\n            expansion_count += 1\n            output_row_index += 1\n        expansion_factors.append(expansion_count)\n\n\n    return expansion_factors\n\n# Example Usage (using provided task examples):\ntask_id = '3ed85e60'\ntrain_examples = [\n    {\n        \"input\": [[0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2]],\n        \"output\": [[0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]],\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0]],\n        \"output\": [[8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]],\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[6, 1, 1, 6, 1], [1, 6, 6, 1, 6], [6, 1, 1, 6, 1]],\n        \"output\": [[6, 1, 1, 6, 1], [6, 1, 1, 6, 1], [6, 1, 1, 6, 1], [1, 6, 6, 1, 6], [1, 6, 6, 1, 6], [6, 1, 1, 6, 1], [6, 1, 1, 6, 1]],\n    }\n]\n\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(train_examples):\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    expansion_factors = analyze_row_expansion(example[\"input\"], example[\"output\"])\n    print(f\"  Expansion Factors: {expansion_factors}\")\n\n```\n\nExample 1:\n  Expansion Factors: [3, 2, 2, 3]\nExample 2:\n  Expansion Factors: [3, 2, 2, 3]\nExample 3:\n  Expansion Factors: [3, 2, 2]\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask_id: 3ed85e60\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Represents the initial state of the pixels.\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    description: Represents the transformed state of the pixels.\n  - name: row\n    type: 1D array\n    description: A horizontal line of pixels within a grid.\nactions:\n  - name: expand_row\n    description: Replicates a row from the input grid multiple times in the output grid.\n    parameters:\n      - name: row_index\n        type: integer\n        description: The index of the row in the input grid.\n      - name: expansion_factor\n        type: integer\n        description: The number of times the row is replicated.\n    logic: |\n      The expansion factor depends on the row index.

Each row of the input grid is replicated vertically in the output grid. The number of times a row is replicated (the expansion factor) depends on its index within the input grid:\n\n*   Row index 0: Replicated 3 times.\n*   Row index 1: Replicated 2 times.\n*   Row index 2: Replicated 2 times.\n*   Row Index 3: Replicated 3 times.\n*   If a row index does not exist, it is not used.\n\nThe horizontal arrangement (order of pixels within each row) remains unchanged. The output grid's height is the sum of all the replicated rows.\n"
