Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid's pattern is replicated vertically and horizontally to create a larger output grid. The spatial arrangement of non-zero digits is maintained. The output grid's dimensions are integer multiples of the input grid's dimensions.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Convert input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    input_height, input_width = input_array.shape

    # Determine replication factors. For this specific case it appears to always
    # replicate by factor of 3 vertically and 1 horizontally, then add
    # vertically to the original
    height_replication_factor = 3
    width_replication_factor = 1
    
    # initialize and build output in steps to clarify process
    output_array = np.tile(input_array, (height_replication_factor, width_replication_factor))
    output_array = np.concatenate((input_array, output_array), axis=0)


    return output_array.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
