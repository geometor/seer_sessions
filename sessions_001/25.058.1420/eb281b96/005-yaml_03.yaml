facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is always replicated vertically. The width of the
      output is identical to the width of the input.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (representing colors)
    actions:
      - replicated vertically
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      type: 2D array
      elements: integers (representing colors)
      width: same as input_grid width
      height: multiple of input_grid height
    derivation: derived from input_grid by vertical replication
  - action: vertical_replication
    description: |
      The input grid is copied a number of times vertically. The number
      of copies is determined by dividing the output grid's height by
      the input grid's height.
