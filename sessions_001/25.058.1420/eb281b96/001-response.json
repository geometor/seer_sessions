Here's my breakdown:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe core elements seem to be grids containing numerical values that correspond to colors. The transformation involves an apparent expansion or replication of the input grid to create a larger output grid. The pattern within the input grid seems to be preserved and repeated in the output grid. The non-zero digits are the focal points of the transformation. The zero digits seem to act as a background.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The core pattern within the input is maintained and expanded.\n"
