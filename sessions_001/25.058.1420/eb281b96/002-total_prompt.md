<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2236x1138 at 0x7A608CFC2210>Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements seem to be grids containing numerical values that correspond to colors. The transformation involves an apparent expansion or replication of the input grid to create a larger output grid. The pattern within the input grid seems to be preserved and repeated in the output grid. The non-zero digits are the focal points of the transformation. The zero digits seem to act as a background.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: [0-9] # Representing colors
      - pattern: repeating

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: The input grid's pattern is replicated vertically and/or horizontally.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The spatial arrangement of non-zero digits in the input grid is maintained in the output grid.
  - input_output_size: output is always a multiple dimension of the input - output height/input height is integer, output width/input width is an integer

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:** Examine the input grid and identify the repeating pattern of non-zero digits and their spatial arrangement relative to each other and the zero-valued cells.

2.  **Determine Replication Factor:**
    *   Calculate the ratio of the output grid's height to the input grid's height.
    *   Calculate the ratio of the output grid's width to the input grid's width.

3.  **Replicate the Pattern:**
    *   Copy Input to Output
    *   Repeat copying to fill rows and columns, according to factor determined above, until output grid dimensions are filled.

In simpler terms, the input grid is duplicated a certain number of times, both horizontally and vertically, to create the output grid. The core pattern within the input is maintained and expanded.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
