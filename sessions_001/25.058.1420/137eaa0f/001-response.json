The input grids contain single-digit integers (0-9) representing different colors. The output grid seems to be a condensed representation of the non-zero elements in the input grid. The '0' elements (white pixels) in the input grid appear to be ignored or background. There appears to be a consistent spatial relationship that is roughly preserved during transformation.  Objects that share some form of adjacency, either directly or diagonally, are somehow grouped. The most important element seems to be a gray (5) pixel, that may act like a pivot.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This element is most often represented by the color gray (value 5), though other colors sometimes play this central role, so color alone is insufficient for locating the pivot.\n2.  **Extract Neighbors:** Identify all non-zero pixels directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the identified pivot pixel. Include '0' pixels if the '0' is directly adjacent to pivot.\n3. **Construct 3x3 Output:** Create a 3x3 grid.\n4.  **Place Pivot:** Place the pivot pixel in the center cell (row 1, column 1; using 0-based indexing) of the output grid.\n5.  **Arrange Neighbors:** Place the neighboring pixels identified in step 2 into the corresponding relative positions around the center pixel in the 3x3 output grid. If a neighbor is not one of the 8 positions surrounding the pivot it should not be included in the output grid.\n6.  **Order:** The ordering appears to be based on a top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan. The pivot is always in the output.\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts a 3x3 region centered on a \"pivot\" element (often value 5) from the input grid, preserving the relative positions of the non-zero neighboring pixels, and discards the rest.\n"
