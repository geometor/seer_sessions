observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - object: pixels
    type: elements within grids
    properties:
      - color: determined by integer value
      - position: (row, column) index
      - state: zero or non-zero
actions:
  - action: identify_source_row
    description: Determine the row in the input grid from which to copy pixels.
    logic: TBD (needs further analysis of examples)
  - action: identify_destination_row
    description: Determine the row in the output grid to which pixels will be copied.
    logic: TBD (needs further analysis of examples)
  - action: copy_non_zero_pixels
    description: Copy non-zero pixels from the source row to the destination row.
    constraints:
      - Preserve color.
      - Maintain relative horizontal position.
  - action: maintain_horizontal_position
    description: copy pixels adjusting for horizontal position relative to the grid
    constraints:
        - left pad with zeros if output is wider
