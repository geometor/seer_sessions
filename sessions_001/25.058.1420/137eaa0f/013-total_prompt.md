Previous Code:
```python
"""
Copies non-zero pixels from the last row of the 4x4 input grid to the first row of the 3x3 output grid, preserving color and relative horizontal position.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize a 3x3 output grid filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Get the last row of the input grid.
    last_row = input_grid[-1, :]

    # Find non-zero pixels in the last row and their indices.
    non_zero_indices = np.nonzero(last_row)[0]
    non_zero_values = last_row[non_zero_indices]

    # Copy the non-zero pixels to the first row of the output grid.
    output_grid[0, :len(non_zero_values)] = non_zero_values
    
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
