Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (11x11) containing mostly zeros (white pixels), with a few isolated non-zero pixels, each representing a different color. The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) containing only the non-zero pixels from the input, seemingly arranged based on their original positions.  The background (white/0) is stripped, and only the non zero values remain.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [11, 11]  # Input grid dimensions
      elements: integers (0-9)
      background: 0  # White
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: [row, column]
  - type: reduced_grid
      dimensions: [3,3]
      elements: integers(0-9)

actions:
  - type: filter
    description: Remove all background (0) pixels.
  - type: condense
    description: Arrange remaining pixels into a smaller grid, preserving relative positions.

relationships:
  - input_grid: contains multiple pixels
  - output_grid: subset of input_grid pixels (excluding background)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Scan the input grid and identify all pixels with values other than 0.
2.  Create new output grid.
2.  **Extract and Position:** Extract these non-zero pixels.
3. Populate the output grid from top-left, setting non-zero pixels from the input grid, while all the other pixels are left out.

In simpler terms: Extract all colored pixels from the large grid, and place them into a smaller grid starting from the upper-left, discarding any position with a zero value, thus minimizing the size to fit.
