facts:
  - task: "Arrange colored pixels into a 3x3 grid."
  - objects: "Pixels of different colors (magenta, orange, grey, yellow)."
  - object_properties:
      color: "integer value (0-9), representing a specific color."
      count: "number of pixels of that color."
  - actions:
      - place_magenta: "Place magenta pixels in the top row, left-aligned."
      - place_orange: "Place orange pixels in the top row, rightmost. If two, place the second one in the second row, rightmost."
      - place_grey: "Place grey pixels in the second row, center position."
      - place_yellow: "Place yellow pixels in the bottom row, left-aligned."
  - constraints:
      - output_size: "Output grid is always 3x3."
      - pixel_priority: "Magenta, Orange, Grey and Yellow, if there is no space, do not add pixel to output"
  - observations:
      - example_0: "Correctly placed orange and grey, but misplaced magenta. Output shape is correct"
      - example_1: "Incorrect placement of yellow - only 3 pixels and incorrectly shaped (3,8)"
      - example_2: "Incorrect placement of orange - only 3 pixels, incorrectly shaped (3, 8) output"
      - example_3: "Correct transformation."
