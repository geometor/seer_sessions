facts:
  - observation: Input grids are larger and sparser than output grids.
  - observation: Input grids contain values 0-9, representing colors.
  - observation: Output grids contain a subset of the non-zero values from the input.
  - observation: '0' values in the input are treated as background and are not present in the output, except when directly adjacent to 5.
  - object: Non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: Integer value (1-9).
      - position: (row, column) coordinates.
  - object:  A special pivot or center, frequently, but not always, represented by the color gray (value 5).
    properties:
      - color: Integer Value
      - position: (row, column)
  - action: Condensation/Extraction of non-zero pixels.
  - relationship: Spatial proximity in the input grid influences the arrangement in the output grid.
  - relationship: The output grid appears to be a 3x3 grid centered around a 'pivot' element (often gray/5).
  - relationship: Elements beside the pivot become part of the output.
