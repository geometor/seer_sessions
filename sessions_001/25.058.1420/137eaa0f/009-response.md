Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception:**

The input is a large grid (11x11) mostly filled with zeros (white pixels).  There are a few clusters of non-zero colored pixels. The output is a smaller 3x3 grid containing only the non-zero colored pixels, arranged in a specific way. The positions of the colored pixels in the input grid are seemingly irrelevant; instead, it looks like only colors are kept, and their final locations are reordered. The specific relative locations of the colored pixels are preserved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 11x11
    elements: pixels
    description: Contains mostly 0 (white) pixels, with some non-zero colored pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    description: Contains only the non-zero colored pixels from the input grid, rearranged.
  - object: pixel
    type: element
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9) representing a color.
  - relationship: input_output
    type: transformation
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by extracting non-zero pixels and rearranging them.
  - observation: color_preservation
    description: All non-zero colors in the input grid are present in the output grid.
  - observation: size_reduction
    description: output grid is smaller (3x3) than input grid(11x11).

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color value.
2.  **Extract:** Create a list of these non-zero colored pixels.
3.  **Arrange:** The colored pixels are arranged in row-major order based on their appearance in the input. Duplicate colored pixels adjacent to one another horizontally are placed adjacent to each other, as well.
4. **Construct:** Place them into a 3x3 output grid, maintaining their relative positions and colors.
