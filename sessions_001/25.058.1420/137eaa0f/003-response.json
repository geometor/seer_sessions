There are a few isolated colored pixels and small groups of same-colored pixels. The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) that appears to be a condensed representation, extracting and rearranging certain non-zero pixels from the input. The background of 0 is included.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

Also, note 0 colored pixels to fill in the background of the new grid.\n\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\n\n3.  **Populate the Output Grid:**\n      Arrange the identified objects into the output grid using this rule:\n    *   The two magenta pixels in the top row of input form a 2x1 block starting from the first element of the output grid, and adjacent to it is the first orange pixel, all in the top row.\n    *   The second row consists of one black pixel from the background and one grey, and one orange adjacent pixels.\n    *  Two yellow adjecent pixels form a 1 x 2 block at the beginning of the bottom row.\n\n4. Fill the rest with background color.\n\nEssentially, the program extracts specific colored pixels from the input and arranges the extracted pixels into a fixed 3x3 grid, keeping their relative positions and colors.\n"
