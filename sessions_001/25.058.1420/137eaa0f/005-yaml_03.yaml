facts:
  - task: "Arrange colored objects in a 3x3 grid"
  - objects:
      - color: magenta (6)
        count: "0 or 1"
        shape: "Often 2 adjacent pixels, but may be a single pixel or absent."
        position: "Top row, left-aligned (if present)"
      - color: orange (7)
        count: "1 or 2"
        shape: "Single pixel"
        position: "Top row, rightmost if only one; also in second row, rightmost if two"
      - color: grey (5)
        count: "0 or 1"
        shape: "Single pixel"
        position: "Second row, center (if present)"
      - color: yellow (4)
        count: "0 or 1"
        shape: "Often 2 adjacent pixels, but may be single or absent"
        position: "Bottom row, left-aligned (if present)"
  - grid_size:
    input: variable
    output: 3x3
  - transformation: "Extraction and rearrangement of non-zero pixels"
  - color_preservation: "Pixels retain their original color"
