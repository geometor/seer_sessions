Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another grid of integers. The input grid contains the digits 0 and 1 (white and blue), while the output grid contains 0 and 2 (white and red). The dimensions of the grid seem to change, at least in terms of added rows.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input grid has values 0 (white) and 1 (blue)."
  - observation: "Output grid has values 0 (white) and 2 (red)."
  - observation: "The input grid's blue column becomes a red column in the output."
  - observation: "The output is longer (height) than the input"
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      width: 3
      height: 6
      colors: [white, blue]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      width: 3
      height: 9
      colors: [white, red]
  - relationship: "Every blue (1) pixel in the input is transformed into a red (2) pixel in the output."
  - action: "add rows at the bottom"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels with the value 1 (blue) in the input grid.
2.  **Transform:** Change the value of these pixels to 2 (red).
3.  **Extend:** Add three rows of the output grid to the bottom
