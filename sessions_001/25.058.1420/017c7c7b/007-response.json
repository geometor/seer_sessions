Copy each value to the output grid, with corresponding input row *r* mapping to the output row given by floor(1.5 * *r*). During this, if a cell in the input grid is blue (1), change it to red (2) in the corresponding output grid cell. If the input grid cell is white(0), then the output grid cell will also be white (0).\n\nThis program combines a row expansion of input to output mapping by a factor of 1.5, and a simple color substitution where 0 stays 0, and 1 becomes a 2.\n"
