The input grids contain pixels of two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output grids have the same dimensions as the input grids but contain white (0) and red (2) pixels. The transformation appears to be a simple color substitution. There's a consistent pattern where blue pixels in the input become red pixels in the output, while white pixels remain white.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

The dimensions (height and width) of input and output are the same.\n\nIn essence, the program performs a direct color substitution, replacing all blue pixels with red, and leaving white pixels unchanged.\n"
