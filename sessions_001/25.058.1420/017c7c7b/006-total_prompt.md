Replaces all blue (1) pixels in the input grid with red (2) pixels, keeping white (0) pixels unchanged.

    Transforms an input grid by replacing blue pixels with red pixels.

        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identified the transformation rule for the first training example (replacing blue pixels with red). However, the additional training examples reveal a more complex pattern. The provided code only works for the first example, and fails for the remaining two, because color '0' should become color '1'. Thus, it's not just about color 1, but more about a sequence, or mapping of colors. It is necessary to generalize our natural language program to a complete description.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Examine all input-output pairs, not just the first one, to identify the complete transformation rule.
2.  **Identify the color changes:** It seems like colors can be changed.
3.  **Update Program:** Describe the most simple and complete transformation pattern.
4.  **Prepare for coding:** Use complete report to prepare all the findings before coding.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

To thoroughly analyze the examples, I'll use a conceptual approach, simulating what code execution would reveal:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3 grid with blue (1) and white(0)
    *   Output: 3x3 grid with red (2) and white(0)
    *   Observation: Blue (1) becomes red (2), and white (0) stays white (0).
    *   Code Result: Correct
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5 grid with white (0)
    *   Output: 5x5 grid with blue (1)
    *   Observation: White (0) changes to blue (1)
    *   Code Result: Incorrect, all pixels remain white(0)
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7 with red(2)
    *   Output: 7x7 with white(0)
    *   Observation: Red (2) changes to white (0)
    *   Code Result: Incorrect, all pixels remain red(2)

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
observations:
  example_1:
    input:
      objects:
        - color: blue #1
          shape: contiguous block
        - color: white #0
          shape: contiguous block
    output:
      objects:
        - color: red #2
          shape: contiguous block, corresponds to input blue block
        - color: white #0
          shape: contiguous block, corresponds to input white block
    transformation: blue becomes red, white stays white

  example_2:
    input:
      objects:
        - color: white #0
          shape: entire grid
    output:
      objects:
        - color: blue #1
          shape: entire grid
    transformation: white becomes blue

  example_3:
    input:
      objects:
       - color: red #2
         shape: entire grid
    output:
      objects:
        - color: white #0
          shape: entire grid
    transformation: red becomes white

overall_transformation:
   mapping:
     0 : 1  #white to blue
     1 : 2  #blue to red
     2 : 0  #red to white
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a color mapping. Iterate through each pixel in the input grid. Apply the following color changes: White (0) becomes blue (1), blue (1) becomes red (2) and red (2) becomes white(0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
