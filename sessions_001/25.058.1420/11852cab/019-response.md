Okay, let's analyze the results of the first attempt and refine the approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code correctly identifies the core concept of symmetry around a blue pixel and focuses on vertically adjacent yellow pixels. However, the provided examples and results reveal that the transformation is not always solely vertical, and includes horizontal symmetry. The strategy needs to consider both vertical and horizontal mirroring of yellow pixels around the blue "center" pixel.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, using code execution to verify details when appropriate:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, expected_output, actual_output):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    expected_output = np.array(expected_output)
    actual_output = np.array(actual_output)

    blue_pixel_input = np.argwhere(input_grid == 1)
    blue_pixel_expected = np.argwhere(expected_output == 1)
    blue_pixel_actual = np.argwhere(actual_output == 1)

    yellow_pixels_input = np.argwhere(input_grid == 4)
    yellow_pixels_expected = np.argwhere(expected_output == 4)
    yellow_pixels_actual = np.argwhere(actual_output == 4)
    
    input_shape = input_grid.shape
    expected_shape = expected_output.shape
    actual_shape = actual_output.shape

    # check input and expected
    same = np.array_equal(input_grid, expected_output)
    same_actual = np.array_equal(input_grid, actual_output)

    print(f"  Input shape: {input_shape}, Expected shape: {expected_shape}, Actual shape: {actual_shape}")
    print(f"  Blue pixel (input): {blue_pixel_input}, Blue pixel (expected): {blue_pixel_expected}, Blue pixel (actual): {blue_pixel_actual}")
    print(f"  Yellow pixels (input): {yellow_pixels_input.shape[0]}, Yellow pixels (expected): {yellow_pixels_expected.shape[0]}, Yellow pixels (actual): {yellow_pixels_actual.shape[0]}")
    print(f"  input == expected: {same}, input == actual: {same_actual}")

**Example Analysis Summary:**

*   **Example 1:** Input and output are identical. The code correctly leaves the input unchanged as there are no blue or yellow pixels.
*   **Example 2:**  The code correctly identifies the blue pixel and the adjacent yellow pixels. It correctly duplicates the yellow pixels vertically.
*   **Example 3:** Input and output are identical. The code also correctly gets the same output.
*   **Example 4:** Input and output are identical. The code also correctly gets the same output.
*   **Example 5:** Input and output are identical. The code also correctly gets the same output.
*    **Example 6:** Input and output are identical. The code also correctly gets the same output.

**YAML Fact Representation:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: blue_pixel
    properties:
      color: blue (1)
      role: center_of_symmetry
      count: 0 or 1  # There can be zero or one blue pixel.
  - object: yellow_pixels
    properties:
      color: yellow (4)
      relationship: adjacent_to_blue_pixel # Horizontally or vertically.
    actions:
      - name: duplicate
        description: Replicated symmetrically across the blue pixel, both horizontally and vertically.
  - object: other_pixels
    properties:
       relationship: not_adjacent_to_blue
    actions:
      - name: no_change
        description: Pixels that are not yellow and adjacent to the blue pixel remain unchanged.
```

**Refined Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Blue Pixel (if present):** Search for a single blue (1) pixel within the grid. This pixel acts as the center of a two-fold rotational symmetry. If no blue pixel is found, the grid remains unchanged.

2.  **Identify Adjacent Yellow Pixels:** Locate all yellow (4) pixels directly adjacent to the blue pixel, either horizontally or vertically.

3.  **Duplicate Yellow Pixels Symmetrically:**
    *   For each yellow pixel found adjacent to the blue pixel, create a mirror image of that pixel on the opposite side of the blue pixel, at the same distance.  This mirroring occurs both horizontally and vertically.
    *   If a mirrored position is occupied by a yellow pixel in the input, the mirrored position remains a yellow pixel.
    *   Only yellow pixels adjacent to the blue pixel are mirrored.

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:**  All pixels that are not yellow and adjacent to the blue pixel retain their original values.
