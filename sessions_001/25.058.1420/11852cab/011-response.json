            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was designed to identify a cross-shaped pattern and extend the central red pixel horizontally. The tests reveal that this approach is too specific and doesn't generalize well to all cases. The crosses are not always perfectly centered or even perfectly cross-shaped, and the strategy of horizontal-only extension is a limiting factor. There is also ambiguity about what to do when no cross and no red pixel is present.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Examine each input/output pair, noting the code's success or failure. Identify where the assumptions of the initial code break down. Pay close attention to the structure, location and existence of the red pixels.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML block with specific observations about objects (red pixels, other colored pixels), their relationships (cross shape, horizontal/vertical lines), and the transformations (extending red). Focus on how it is that red pixels can be found, and what actions should be taken on those pixels.\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to reflect the updated observations. The new program should be more general and robust, handling different arrangements and not relying on strict cross shapes. The core concept seems to be *extending* a red pixel, and the new program will describe precisely how that is decided.\n\n**Code Execution for Metrics**\n\nI don't have the ability to execute code directly. I will use the provided inputs, outputs, and previous code to generate the metrics.\n\nMetrics Report\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Cross Detected | Red Pixel Found | Red Extended |  Success | Notes                                                                                                                       |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0       | (11, 11)   | (11, 11)     | Yes            | Yes           | Yes       | True    |  The original example.

If no red pixels are present, return the grid unchanged.\n"
