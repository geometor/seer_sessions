Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code focused on extending *horizontally* adjacent red pixels to the left and right, but only if the target cell is black (0). This strategy works for the first example but fails on subsequent examples. The core issue seems to be that the extension rule isn't universally applicable and doesn't capture the complete transformation logic, specifically:

1.  **Color Change Condition:** The extension doesn't *only* happen when the adjacent pixel is black. It might overwrite other colors. The training examples demonstrate the extension occurs regardless of the neighboring pixel's color, as long as we are within the grid boundary.
2.  **Missing Vertical Extension:** The initial logic only considers horizontal extensions. The other training examples demonstrate vertical extension.

The strategy to resolve these errors will involve:

1.  **Relaxing the Color Constraint:** Modify the extension logic to disregard the color of the neighboring pixel. Extension should occur as long as it's within the grid bounds.
2.  **Adding Vertical Extension:** Incorporate logic to identify vertically adjacent red pixels and extend them upwards and downwards, similar to the horizontal extension.
3.  **Object Recognition**: All groups of adjacent pixels should be extended

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformation, let's analyze each example pair individually:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A single horizontal line of red pixels.
    *   Output: The red line is extended by one pixel on each end.
    *   `transform` result: Correct.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: A 2x2 square of red pixels in the top-left corner, with various colored pixels.
    *   Output: The red square extends to become a 4x4.
    *   `transform` result: Incorrect. Only horizontal expansion occurs.
*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input: Two separate red pixels.
    *   Output: Both expand into a 3x3 block.
    *   `transform` result: Incorrect. Only horizontal expansion occurs for some reason.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - type: horizontal_line
          color: red
          length: 3
      output_objects:
        - type: horizontal_line
          color: red
          length: 5
      transformation: Horizontal extension of red line by one pixel on each end.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - type: square
          color: red
          size: 2x2
      output_objects:
        - type: square
          color: red
          size: 4x4
      transformation:  Expansion of the red square in all directions.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - type: single_pixel
          color: red
        - type: single_pixel
          color: red
      output_objects:
        - type: square
          color: red
          size: 3x3
        - type: square
          color: red
          size: 3x3
      transformation: Each red pixel expands into a 3x3 square.
general_rule: All contiguous groups of red pixels expand outwards by one pixel in all four directions (up, down, left, right), regardless of initial shape.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.

2.  **Group Adjacent Red Pixels:** Identify groups of adjacent red pixels. Adjacency includes both horizontal and vertical neighbors. Diagonal pixels are *not* considered adjacent for the purpose of forming groups.

3.  **Expand Red Groups:** For each group of adjacent red pixels:
    *   **Extend Left:** Add one red pixel to the left of the leftmost pixel(s) in the group, if the extension is within the grid boundaries.
    *   **Extend Right:** Add one red pixel to the right of the rightmost pixel(s) in the group, if within bounds.
    *   **Extend Up:** Add one red pixel above the topmost pixel(s) in the group, if within bounds.
    *   **Extend Down:** Add one red pixel below the bottommost pixel(s) in the group, if within bounds.

4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** Pixels that are not part of any expanded red group remain unchanged.

5. **No Red Pixels**: If the input array contains no red pixels, the output should be identical to the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
