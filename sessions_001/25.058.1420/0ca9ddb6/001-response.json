            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe task involves 9x9 grids. The input grids contain single pixels of various colors (besides white/0), while the output grids seem to expand these single pixels into cross-shaped patterns, using two different colors. The central color of input is maintained at the center, a new color outlines it. The output introduces two new colors, yellow(4) and orange(7). The location of the colored pixels in the input appears to determine the location of the cross-shaped patterns in the output. It seems each single non-zero pixel in the input maps to a 5-pixel cross in output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Otherwise, color top and adjacent bottom pixels with color 7(orange).\n    *   If the input pixel's row is less than 5, color the adjacent left and right pixels with color 4(yellow). Otherwise, color the adjacent left and right pixels with color 7(orange).\n3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Place the generated cross patterns onto a new 9x9 grid, initially filled with 0s. The center of each cross pattern should correspond to the position of the original non-zero pixel in the input grid.\n\nIn summary the rule creates a '+' shaped object centered on the position of each color pixel in the input. The color of the center is the same as the input pixel. The outline of the '+' uses color 4(yellow) if it's within the first 4 rows and columns of the input, and uses orange(7) otherwise.\n"
