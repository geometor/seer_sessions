The input grid appears to contain isolated, single-pixel colored objects (red, blue, magenta). The output grid seems to introduce new colored pixels (yellow, orange) around the original ones, expanding them in some way. The original colors seem to be preserved. There's a sense of \"filling\" or \"expansion\" around existing colored pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
