Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good start, correctly identifying the basic concept of non-white pixels triggering changes. However, the code and description failed to accurately capture the behavior of red and blue pixels in all cases, particularly edge cases and it seems like some colors where simply missed. The strategy will involve a detailed examination of each example, focusing on the discrepancies between the predicted output (generated by the current code) and the actual output. This will help pinpoint the specific rules that are missing or incorrectly implemented.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Comparison:** For each example, meticulously compare the provided input, expected output, and the output generated by the current code. Note every difference in pixel color and position.
2.  **Rule Refinement:** Based on the comparison, adjust the natural language program. Specifically, address the following:
    *   The exact conditions under which blue pixels create orange crosses.
    *   The exact conditions under which red pixels create yellow crosses.
    *   The exact behavior near the edges of the grid.
    *   The correct handling of any other non-white pixels (beyond the Azure handled correctly).
3.  **Iterative Improvement:** After revising the natural language program, the code will be updated to reflect the changes, and the process will be repeated on the training set until perfect matches on all example input-output pairs is achieved.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I will analyze each example and determine the differences:

    behavior: Remains unchanged
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Non-White Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (color 0).

2.  **Azure Pixel Rule:** If a pixel is azure (color 8), it remains unchanged in the output grid.

3. **Green Pixel Rule:** If a pixel is green (color 3), it remains unchanged.

4.  **Blue Pixel Rule:** If a pixel is blue (color 1), it remains blue in the output, and an orange (color 7) cross is created, centered on the blue pixel. The cross extends one pixel in each of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  If the blue pixel is at the edge, the cross is created only for the valid positions.

5.  **Red Pixel Rule:** If a pixel is red (color 2), it remains red, and a yellow (color 4) cross shape is created two spaces away from the red pixel in all four cardinal directions. If the red pixel is too close to an edge, the cross at two spaces away is only created in positions that are within the grid bounds.

6. **Other Colors:** All other cells not explicitly mentioned above should be white (0) in the output grid.
