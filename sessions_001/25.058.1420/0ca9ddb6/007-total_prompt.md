Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code correctly identifies the core concept of expanding around center pixels of specific colors (red=2, blue=1). However, it only considers immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). The third example reveals that the expansion isn't limited to direct neighbors, and it appears we need to consider an "aura" or filled in area around the color in question. Also, the choice of expansion color depends on *both* the center color and the existing color surrounding.  If the center is blue, but there's already a non-zero value, we don't overwrite the previous expansion with Orange (7) if that space has been claimed by a previous expansion. The error analysis of example 3 clearly shows that there are two expansion colors: Orange (7) and Yellow (4), depending on the color being expanded.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Neighbor Identification:** Instead of just direct neighbors, we need a way to identify all cells within a certain "radius" or that are "connected" to the center pixel. This sounds like a flood fill or a connected component analysis.
2.  **Conditional Expansion:** The expansion color depends on the center pixel's color.
3. **Prioritize Expansions:** We need to consider the order in which we handle the expansion. This might involve expanding all red center pixels first before expanding all blue.
4.  Re-run Error Analysis on the Test Case

**Metrics and Observations (from provided code execution output):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Number of Errors: 0
    *   Details: No errors found. The initial code works perfectly for this simple case.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Number of Errors: 0
    *   Details: No errors found. The initial code works perfectly for this simple case.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Number of Errors: 4
    *   Error Details:
        *   Row: 3, Col: 1, Expected: 4, Actual: 0, Input: 0
        *   Row: 3, Col: 4, Expected: 4, Actual: 0, Input: 0
        *   Row: 4, Col: 2, Expected: 4, Actual: 0, Input: 0
        *   Row: 4, Col: 3, Expected: 4, Actual: 0, Input: 0

    *   Analysis: The errors in Example 3 indicate that the yellow (4) expansion around the red (2) pixel is not wide enough.  It appears to extend by *two* on all sides.

**YAML Fact Representation:**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: center_pixel
    properties:
      color: [red, blue] # Values 2 and 1, respectively
      expansion_color: {red: yellow, blue: orange} # 4 for red, 7 for blue
      expansion_type: "aura" #all contiguous zeros around a center get the expansion color

  - object: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: variable # Rows and columns can vary.
      cell_values: [0-9] # Represents colors

  - action: expand
    description: "Fill contiguous zero-valued cells surrounding a center pixel with a specified color, dependent on the center pixel color. Expansion stops on the border of the grid or at any other non-zero value."
    constraints:
      - "Expansion color for red center is yellow."
      - "Expansion color for blue center is orange."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
2.  **Red Expansion:** Locate all red (value 2) pixels in the input grid. For each red pixel, change all directly and diagonally contiguous pixels (the "aura") with a value of 0 to yellow (value 4). Stop when reaching the border or a non-zero value.
3. **Blue Expansion:** Locate all blue (value 1) pixels. Fill their "aura" (contiguous zero-value region, directly or diagonally touching) with orange (value 7). Stop when the boundary or a non-zero value is hit.

This refined natural language program now accounts for the "aura" or connected region expansion, addresses the different expansion colors, and establishes the correct color expansion strategy.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
