"""
1. **Identify Centers:** Locate all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These are the "center" pixels.
2. **Red Center Expansion:** For each pixel with the value '2' (red) in the input grid, place pixels of value '4' (yellow) directly above, below, and to the left and right of it in the output grid. Do not replace the original '2'.
3. **Blue Center Expansion:** For each pixel with the value '1' (blue) in the input grid, place pixels with the value '7' (orange) directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it in the output grid. Do not replace the original '1'.
4.  **Preserve Zeros:** All '0' (white) pixels in the input that do not have colored pixels placed over them, remain '0' in the output.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept of expanding around center pixels of specific colors. However, the initial program failed because it did not account for existing colors. It overwrote them when placing yellow and orange pixels. The strategy for improvement involves modifying the code to *only* write to '0' (white) pixels, preserving other non-zero colors.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Examine the provided example grids and the outputs generated by the current code to pinpoint where the overwriting occurs.
2.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the natural language program to clearly state the condition of only placing the expansion colors (yellow and orange) on cells that are currently white (0).
3.  **Modify Code:** Adjust the `transform` function to include a check before placing a color. Only change the output grid cell if its current value is 0.
4. **Execution and validation**: use python to provide specific details of the grids

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution):**

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: center_pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - red (2)
        - blue (1)
      neighbors: [above, below, left, right]

  - name: expansion_pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - yellow (4)  # Expands from red
        - orange (7)  # Expands from blue
      location_constraint:
        - must be adjacent to center_pixel
        - must be on a white (0) cell

actions:
  - name: expand
    agent: center_pixel
    target: expansion_pixel
    condition: adjacent cell is white (0)
    result:
      - red (2) center_pixel creates adjacent yellow (4) expansion_pixels
      - blue (1) center_pixel creates adjacent orange (7) expansion_pixels
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Center Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have a value of '2' (red) or '1' (blue). These are the "center pixels."

2.  **Conditional Red Expansion:** For each red (2) center pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (above, below, left, and right). If a neighboring cell has a value of '0' (white), change that cell's value to '4' (yellow) in the output grid. Do *not* change the value of the center pixel or any non-white neighboring cell.

3.  **Conditional Blue Expansion:** For each blue (1) center pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (above, below, left, and right). If a neighboring cell has a value of '0' (white), change that cell's value to '7' (orange) in the output grid. Do *not* change the value of the center pixel or any non-white neighboring cell.

4. **Preserve:** Any input pixels that are not center pixels or changed during expansion, should keep the same value.

The key difference from the previous natural language program is the explicit condition that expansion only occurs onto white (0) cells, preventing the overwriting of other colors. This constraint directly addresses the errors observed in the test results.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
