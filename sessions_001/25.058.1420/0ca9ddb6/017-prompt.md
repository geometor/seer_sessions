Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all non-white pixels in the input grid. These are our "source" pixels.
2.  **For each** source pixel:
    *   If the source pixel is blue (1), create orange (7) pixels in all 8 directly adjacent positions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    *   If the source pixel is red (2) , create a yellow (4) cross pattern by adding a new yellow pixel on cells directly up and down, directly left and right.
    *.  If the source pixel is magenta(6), do not add new pixels
3.  **Preserve** the original source pixels in their original locations and colors.
4. **Return** the modified grid.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
