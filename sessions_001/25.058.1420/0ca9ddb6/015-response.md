Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to contain isolated, single-pixel colored objects (red, blue, magenta). The output grid seems to introduce new colored pixels (yellow, orange) around the original ones, expanding them in some way. The original colors seem to be preserved. There's a sense of "filling" or "expansion" around existing colored pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: [white, red, blue, magenta, yellow, orange]
      position: [row, column]
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9x9]

actions:
  - name: expand
    description: Add new pixels of a specific color around existing pixels.
    parameters:
      source_color: Color of the original pixel.
      target_color: Color of the newly added pixels.
      pattern:  The shape or rule of expansion (adjacent).

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description:  New pixels are placed adjacent to existing pixels of a particular color.
  - type: color_mapping
    description:  input colors map to different output expansion
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-white pixels in the input grid. These are our "source" pixels.
2.  **For each** source pixel:
    *   If the source pixel is blue (1), create orange (7) pixels in all 8 directly adjacent positions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals).
    *   If the source pixel is red (2) , create a yellow (4) cross pattern by adding a new yellow pixel on cells directly up and down, directly left and right.
    *.  If the source pixel is magenta(6), do not add new pixels
3.  **Preserve** the original source pixels in their original locations and colors.
4. **Return** the modified grid.
