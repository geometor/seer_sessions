The input grid appears to have regions of solid color and regions where colors are arranged in patterns. A significant portion of the grid is made of white (0) colored pixels. The task involves a transformation that dramatically alters the grid. It seems to blank large square regions to white (0).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
