The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical (21x21). A significant portion of the input grid seems to be \"filled in\" with white (0) pixels, forming a distinct shape, while the output grid does not have these white pixels. It appears that all other colored pixels and their locations are preserved, and the white pixels are removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
