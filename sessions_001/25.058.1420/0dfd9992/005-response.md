Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output appear to be grids of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The dimensions of the input and output grids are identical (21x21). A significant portion of the input grid seems to be "filled in" with white (0) pixels, forming a distinct shape, while the output grid does not have these white pixels. It appears that all other colored pixels and their locations are preserved, and the white pixels are removed.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_description:
  task_id: train_1
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [21, 21]
    data_type: integer
    color_map:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow
      5: gray
      6: magenta
      7: orange
      8: azure
      9: maroon
  output_grid:
    dimensions: [21, 21]
    data_type: integer
    color_map:
      0: white
      1: blue
      2: red
      3: green
      4: yellow
      5: gray
      6: magenta
      7: orange
      8: azure
      9: maroon
  objects:
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        color: [0-9]
        position: [row, column]
  actions:
    - name: remove_pixels
      condition: color == 0
  relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: pixels are arranged in a 2D grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to remove all pixels with the color white (0) from the input grid, while keeping all other pixels and their relative positions the same. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but with white pixels removed. The transformation effectively removes a "background" of white pixels, preserving the shape formed by other colors.
