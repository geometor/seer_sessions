- observation: The input grids are 10x10 and contain white pixels (value 0) and non-white pixels (other values).
- action: White pixels are removed.
- object_persistence: Non-white pixels retain their color value during the transformation.
- object_compaction: Non-white pixels in each column are compacted downwards, removing any gaps of white pixels.
- column_independence: Each column is treated independently during the compaction process.
- output_dimension: The output grid's height is determined by the column with the maximum number of stacked non-white pixels. The output grid's width is always 1.
