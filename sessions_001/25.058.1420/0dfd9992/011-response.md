Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The primary element is a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have regions of solid color and regions where colors are arranged in patterns. A significant portion of the grid is made of white (0) colored pixels. The task involves a transformation that dramatically alters the grid. It seems to blank large square regions to white (0).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 21
      - height: 21
      - cell_values: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - type: transformation
    description: Changes white pixels to other colors
    properties:
        - input: grid
        - output: grid
        - rule : Remove large white areas

  - type: colors
    description: map color values and common names
    properties:
        - 0: white
        - 1: blue
        - 2: red
        - 3: green
        - 4: yellow
        - 5: gray
        - 6: magenta
        - 7: orange
        - 8: azure
        - 9: maroon
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify White Regions:** Scan the input grid to identify contiguous regions of white (0) pixels. A "contiguous region" is defined as a group of white pixels connected horizontally or vertically.

2.  **Remove White Regions:** Set the entire region, including the white pixel and its surrounding 8 neighbors, to the value of its top left corner.

3. **Output Result**: output the result.
