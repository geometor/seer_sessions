Okay, I've reviewed the input and output grids for the `train_3` example. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid appears to contain multiple colored "objects" or regions. Some regions are solid blocks of a single color, while others seem to be composed of alternating colors in a checkerboard pattern. The output grid looks like a simplified or filtered version of the input grid, where certain colors have been removed or replaced, specifically the white (0) pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids have the same dimensions (21x21)."
  - object: "Checkerboard patterns"
    properties:
      colors: ["green/red", "blue/gray", "magenta/azure"]
      arrangement: "Alternating pixels of two colors."
  - object: "Solid blocks"
    properties:
      colors: [green, red, blue, grey, magenta, azure]
      arrangement: "Contiguous regions of a single color."
  - action: "Removal"
    target: "white pixels (0)"
    condition: "All instances."
  - relationship: "Output retains all non-white pixels from input."
  - relationship: "Output dimensions are identical to Input"

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** if it equals 0 (white color code).
3.  **Copy**: If not 0 keep the value in output grid
4.  **Remove:** if input pixel is equal to 0 (white), replace all white colored pixels to the color of its background, by checking for non-white neighbors.
5. **Ignore**: Copy all other input cells to corresponding output cell.

In essence, the transformation rule is to eliminate all the white pixels, maintaining the original positions and colors of all other pixels. The overall structure and non-white elements of the grid are preserved.
