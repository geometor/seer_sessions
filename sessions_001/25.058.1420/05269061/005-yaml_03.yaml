facts:
  - observation: "All input grids contain only colors 0, 2, 3, and 8."
  - observation: "All output grids contain only colors 2, 3, and 8 (no 0)."
  - observation: "Input and output grids have the same dimensions in all examples."
  - observation: "The 3x3 seed is always taken from the top-left of the input grid."
  - observation: "The seed always contains 0, 2, 3, and 8 in the input."
  - observation: "Zeros in the seed are replaced by non-zero values in the output."
  - observation: "The first row of the input contains a repeating sequence of non-zero values."
  - observation: "The repeating sequence in the output's first row matches the non-zero sequence from the input first row."
  - observation: "The output is created by repeating the seed, but the zeros in the seed are replaced dynamically based on their position and the repeating color sequence in the seed of the first row of non-zero values"
