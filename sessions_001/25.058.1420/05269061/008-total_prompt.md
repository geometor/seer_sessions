Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, assuming a 3x3 seed pattern that gets dynamically modified and then tiled. The results of running the code on the other training examples show that this assumption is incorrect. The code works for the first example, but fails for the subsequent examples, which clearly indicates the presence of a different, or at least a more nuanced, rule that it's not capturing. Therefore, we need to revise the transformation rule in the natural language program. The concept of a seed and tiling may still be valid, the approach to find the seed is different.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the input and output grids for each training example, along with the code's output. Note specific discrepancies.
2.  **Identify Correct Rule:** Attempt to discern a consistent rule that explains all the input-output transformations. Specifically, re-evaluate the logic used to determine the seed, and consider that the seed definition and tiling parameters may not be uniform.
3. **Update Natural Language Program:** revise the natural language program to accurately reflect the newly identified rule.
4. **Code Execution:** Utilize code execution to gain precise insights about objects, patterns, and discrepancies.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution when needed):**

Here's a breakdown of each example, I am also including the output of the current code, to check the result of the previous code:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 6x6, repeating pattern of `1, 0, 2, 0` in the first row.
    *   Output: 6x6, 3x3 seed `[[1, 0, 2], [0, 2, 1], [2, 1, 0]]` tiled.
    *   Code Output: Correct
    *   Observation: The original assumption and code are correct.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 9x9, repeating pattern of `3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0` in the first row.
    *   Output: 9x9, 3x3 seed`[[3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 3]]` tiled.
    *   Code Output: Incorrect. The code applies a similar dynamic seed mechanism, but using all zeros as the substitution.
    *   Observation: The substitution logic on zeros is dependent on position. The non-zero values from first row: 3, 4. the seed is 3x3, it replaces zeros by row index + 1.
    *   Discrepancy: code does not obtain `[[3, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 3]]`.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 12x12, repeating pattern of `5, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0` in the first row.
    *   Output: 12x12, 4x4 seed `[[5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0], [0,0,0,6]]` tiled.
    *   Code Output: Incorrect.
    *   Observation: The seed pattern is not based only on first row and is 4x4 instead of 3x3. Seed pattern seems to be derived from the distribution of non-zero values in the input. The seed's non-zero values appear in a diagonal-like pattern.
    *   Discrepancy: The code assumes a fixed 3x3 pattern and does not obtain the seed from first row of input.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Size:** The seed size corresponds to the repeating unit size in the input grid. Examine the input grid. Count the number of columns until the first non-zero number repeats, this is the dimension of the square seed.
2.  **Extract Seed:** Create an empty square matrix filled with zeros with dimensions obtained in previous step.
3.  **Populate seed:** Iterate through the non-zero elements of the input's first row. For each element, place the value into the dynamic seed at the row index corresponding to its position in the sequence, starting from 0.
4.  **Tile the Seed:** Tile the created seed across the output grid, repeating it both horizontally and vertically to match the dimensions of the input grid. The output grid's dimensions will be the same size of the input grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
