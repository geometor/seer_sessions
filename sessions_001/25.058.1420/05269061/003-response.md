Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a pattern of non-zero colored pixels (red, azure, green, white based on the color mapping) in the top-left corner, with the rest of the grid being white (value 0). The output grid appears to expand this initial pattern, filling the entire grid while alternating the original colors. The key seems to lie in how the initial non-zero sequence propagates and replicates across the entire output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - pattern: non-zero values in top-left corner, rest are 0
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - pattern: repetition of the input's non-zero sequence, maintaining relative positions. The 0s are replaced based on surrounding context.
  - relation: transformation
    type: pattern expansion
    details: |
      The non-zero sequence in the input grid is replicated horizontally and vertically to fill the output. The values in the non-zero sequence maintain their order as the pattern fills the output grid, alternating in the 'empty' areas.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Seed Pattern:** Locate the contiguous block of non-zero pixels in the top-left corner of the input grid. This constitutes the "seed" pattern. In this case, that's the 3x3 block with values:
    

```
    2 8 3
    8 3 0
    3 0 0
    ```


    and we want to extend that final row to fill the 3x3 seed, such as:
    

```
    2 8 3
    8 3 x
    3 x x
    ```


    where we will determine `x`

2.  **Determine Filling Logic:** Analyze the relationship between the seed and the overall dimensions. The seed will be used to generate the output. The output is the same dimension as the input.
    In the seed, wherever the original input had a `0`, an alternating sequence must fill that spot. Let's look at the input seed, and consider the values *before* the `0`:

    

```
    2 8 3
    8 3 0
    3 0 0
    ```


    The zero in `(1,2)` has `3` above it. The zero in `(2,1)` has `8` to the left. The last zero has both `3` and `0`, taking `2`.
    The rule is the value in the input `2 8 3` is inserted when there are `0`s.

3.  **Horizontal and Vertical Replication:**
    *   Take the completed 3x3 and propagate this pattern across and down.

4.  **Complete output.**



```
2 8 3 2 8 3 2
8 3 2 8 3 2 8
3 2 8 3 2 8 3
2 8 3 2 8 3 2
8 3 2 8 3 2 8
3 2 8 3 2 8 3
2 8 3 2 8 3 2
```
