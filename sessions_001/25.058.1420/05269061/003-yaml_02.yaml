  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - pattern: non-zero values in top-left corner, rest are 0

    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 7x7
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - pattern: repetition of the input's non-zero sequence, maintaining relative positions. The 0s are replaced based on surrounding context.
  - relation: transformation
    type: pattern expansion

      The non-zero sequence in the input grid is replicated horizontally and vertically to fill the output. The values in the non-zero sequence maintain their order as the pattern fills the output grid, alternating in the 'empty' areas.
