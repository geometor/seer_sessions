The input grid appears to have a diagonal pattern of azure (8), green (3), and yellow (4), moving from top-left to bottom-right. The rest of the grid is filled with white (0). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, but the white pixels are replaced, seemingly completing the diagonal patterns started by the non-white pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
