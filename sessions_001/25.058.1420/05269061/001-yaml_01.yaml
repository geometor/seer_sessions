objects:
  - grid: A 2D array of integers.
  - cell: An element within the grid, containing a single digit (0-9).
  - sequence:  A repeating pattern of non-zero digits extracted from the input grid.

properties:
  - grid_size:  The dimensions (rows x columns) of the grid.
  - cell_value: The integer value of a cell (representing a color).
  - non_zero_values: Set of digits in the input grid that aren't zero.

actions:
  - extract_sequence: Identify and order the unique non-zero digits from the input grid, it seems they are ordered numerically.
  - repeat_sequence:  Replicate the extracted sequence across the entire output grid, replacing 0 with repeating elements.

relationships:
  - input_to_sequence:  The non-zero values in the input grid define the repeating sequence in the output grid.
  - sequence_to_output: The sequence is used to fill all cells of the output grid, overwriting all original values.
