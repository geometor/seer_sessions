The input grid contains a pattern of non-zero colored pixels (red, azure, green, white based on the color mapping) in the top-left corner, with the rest of the grid being white (value 0). The output grid appears to expand this initial pattern, filling the entire grid while alternating the original colors. The key seems to lie in how the initial non-zero sequence propagates and replicates across the entire output grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
