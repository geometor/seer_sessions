The transformation rule involves identifying a 3x3 seed pattern in the top-left corner of the input grid and creating a dynamic seed by replacing the 0 values based on their position and a repeating sequence of non-zero colors from the input's first row. The output grid is then generated by tiling this dynamic seed.
