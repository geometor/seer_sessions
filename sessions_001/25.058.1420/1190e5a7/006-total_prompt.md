Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Border:** Locate the '7's (orange pixels) in the input grid. These form a large, thick-lined square open at the top.
2.  **Locate Upper Right Corner** Find the internal upper right corner created by open border
3.  **Define Extraction Area:** Identify the 2x4 rectangular region of '3's (green pixels) inside, and adjacent to this upper right corner.
4.  **Extract:** Extract this 2x4 region.
5.  **Output:** The extracted 2x4 region becomes the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the initial code against all training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it correctly identified the extraction logic for that specific case. However, the other examples reveal a flaw: the assumption that the 2x4 region of '3's is *always* adjacent to the upper-right *internal* corner of the orange border. The failure cases show extractions that are close but not quite right. It is clear that the extraction area is *inside* the border, but we will need a more robust method.

The general strategy will be to:

1.  **Refine Corner Detection:**  The current `find_upper_right_corner` function seems overly specific and brittle.  We need to robustly identify the inner border.
2.  **Object Identification:**  We'll try identifying the region of 3s as a coherent "object" and use its properties to determine the extraction.
3.  **Relationship-based Extraction**: Instead of relying solely on the corner, we'll use relationships between parts, the border, the inner empty space, and target 2 x 4 block.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the patterns better, let's use `code_execution` to get some concrete data about the input and output grids of each training example, focusing on the location of the 2x4 region of 3s, the overall dimensions, and corner locations.

I will also focus on the difference between the expected output and the actual output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
