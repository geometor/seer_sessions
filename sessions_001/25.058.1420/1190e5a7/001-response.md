Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), orange (7), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grids are significantly larger than the output grids. The output grids consist of only a single color, which is the most prevalent color in the input grid, excluding the colors that form the border/background. There appears to be a cross like object, the transformation extracts all of one color in the shape, excluding any borders, and produces a new grid of only that color.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: InputGrid
    type: 2D Grid
    properties:
      - colors: [green, orange, blue, azure]
      - size: Variable (large)
    attributes:
        - contains a cross shaped object
  - name: OutputGrid
    type: 2D Grid
    properties:
      - color: Single (green, blue)
      - size: Variable (small)
    attributes:
        - represents a compressed/extracted version of main color of InputGrid
  - name: CrossShape
    type: Object
    properties:
        colors: [green, blue]
        size: Variable
    attributes:
       - is the primary feature extracted from InputGrid

relationships:
  - InputGrid contains CrossShape
  - OutputGrid represents the CrossShape
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Cross-Shaped Object:** Locate the contiguous blocks of color that form the horizontal and vertical lines, excluding the surrounding border of a different color.
2.  **Extract the Primary Shape Color**: Determine the color of the cross shape that is *not* the border.
3. **Create the Output:** Generate a new grid filled entirely with the extracted color from step 2. The size of this new grid is equal to the height and width of the shape. The height of the shape is the number of horizontal lines filled with this color in input grid, and the width of the shape is equal to the number of vertical lines filled with this color.

Essentially, the transformation isolates and extracts the shape, defined by lines intersecting perpendicularly to form a cross shape. It then represents that object as a filled rectangle using the colors the object was constructed from.
