Previous Code:
```python
"""
Extracts the top-left subgrid of 1s from the input grid, stopping before the first occurrence of 8 in any row or column.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_first_occurrence(grid, value):
    """Finds the first row and column index where the given value appears."""
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == value:
                return r, c
    return rows, cols  # Return grid size if value not found


def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Extracts a sub-grid from the input, stopping before the first 8.
    """
    # Convert input_grid to numpy array
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)

    # Find the first occurrence of 8
    first_8_row, first_8_col = find_first_occurrence(input_grid, 8)

    # Extract the subgrid
    output_grid = input_grid[:first_8_row, :first_8_col]

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine our understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to extract a subgrid based on the first occurrence of the value '8'. This works for the first training example but fails on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule is more complex and isn't solely dependent on the presence of '8'. We need to consider other factors, potentially including the overall structure, other colors, and the relative positioning of elements. The examples show that sometimes the output grid is a cropped portion of the input, and the cropping can involve the number of '1' and also other numbers.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting not just the presence of '8', but also the dimensions of the output grid and any other patterns. I'll use `code_execution` to get precise dimensions and identify the presence and location of key colors.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll revise the initial hypothesis (which was "extract subgrid until the first 8"). I'll develop a more comprehensive natural language program that considers all observed factors.
3.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a structured YAML representation of the observed facts, properties, and actions for each example. This will help in forming a general rule.
4.  **Iterative Improvement:** Recognize that the first refined hypothesis might still be imperfect. Be prepared to repeat this process if further testing reveals discrepancies.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To help with the analysis, I need to check the result and dimensions of the grids.

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule identifies the first occurrence of the number '8' within the input grid. The output grid is a cropped section of the input grid.  If '8' appears as a vertical dividing line, the section *before* (to the left of) the first '8' is taken as the output.  If '8' appears as a horizontal dividing line, the section *before* (above) the first '8' is taken.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
