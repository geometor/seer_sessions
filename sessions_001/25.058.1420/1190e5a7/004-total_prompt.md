Okay, here's my analysis of the first example pair, focusing on perception, documenting facts, and creating a natural language program.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (15x15) primarily filled with the value '3' (green). There are '7's (orange) embedded within the grid, forming a distinct pattern: a large, thick-lined square, open at the top. The output is a much smaller 2x4 grid containing only '3's. The output seems to extract a specific region of the input, the internal space of upper right corner.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 15x15
    elements:
      - value: 3
        color: green
        role: background
      - value: 7
        color: orange
        role: border
    description: The main grid containing a pattern.
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 2x4
    elements:
      - value: 3
        color: green
        role: extracted_region
    description: A sub-region extracted from the input grid.
  - name: border_shape
    type: shape
    form:  open_square
    color: orange
    description: a border shape

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: input_grid
    to: border_shape
  - type: part_of
    from: output_grid
    to: input_grid
  - type: extraction
    subject: input_grid
    object: output_grid
    description: The output is a smaller, extracted section of the input.

actions:
   - name: extract_subregion
     agent: SEER
     input: border coordinates and grid
     description: the shape internal area is isolated.
     details: The upper right corner of the large open orange square is selected, where an internal 2x4 area filled with 3s (green) is selected as output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Border:** Locate the '7's (orange pixels) in the input grid. These form a large, thick-lined square open at the top.

2.  **Locate Upper Right Corner** Find the internal upper right corner created by open border

3.  **Define Extraction Area:** Identify the 2x4 rectangular region of '3's (green pixels) inside, and adjacent to this upper right corner.

4.  **Extract:** Extract this 2x4 region.

5.  **Output:** The extracted 2x4 region becomes the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
