There are '7's (orange) embedded within the grid, forming a distinct pattern: a large, thick-lined square, open at the top. The output is a much smaller 2x4 grid containing only '3's. The output seems to extract a specific region of the input, the internal space of upper right corner.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
