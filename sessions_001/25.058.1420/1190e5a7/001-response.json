The primary colors involved seem to be green (3), orange (7), blue (1), and azure (8). The input grids are significantly larger than the output grids. The output grids consist of only a single color, which is the most prevalent color in the input grid, excluding the colors that form the border/background. There appears to be a cross like object, the transformation extracts all of one color in the shape, excluding any borders, and produces a new grid of only that color.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The size of this new grid is equal to the height and width of the shape. The height of the shape is the number of horizontal lines filled with this color in input grid, and the width of the shape is equal to the number of vertical lines filled with this color.\n\nEssentially, the transformation isolates and extracts the shape, defined by lines intersecting perpendicularly to form a cross shape. It then represents that object as a filled rectangle using the colors the object was constructed from.\n"
