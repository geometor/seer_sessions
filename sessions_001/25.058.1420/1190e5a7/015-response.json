The output is a much smaller grid (5x5) consisting entirely of green (3). It seems like the transformation involves a significant reduction in size and a simplification of colors. The azure pixel seems to have disappeared. The blue lines seem to delineate areas of green and the output seems to one of the smallest green areas possible.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
