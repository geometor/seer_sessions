Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (27x27) composed of three colors: green (3), blue (1), and a very small amount of, what appears to be, a single random azure (8) pixel. The output is a much smaller grid (5x5) consisting entirely of green (3). It seems like the transformation involves a significant reduction in size and a simplification of colors. The azure pixel seems to have disappeared. The blue lines seem to delineate areas of green and the output seems to one of the smallest green areas possible.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [27, 27]  # Input grid dimensions
      colors: [3, 1, 8]    # Green, Blue, Azure
    relations:
      - contains: blue_lines
      - contains: green_areas
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [5, 5]  # Output grid dimensions
      colors: [3]      # Green
    relations: []
  - type: lines
    id: blue_lines
    properties:
      color: 1 # Blue
      shape: vertical_and_horizontal # Describes the arrangement of blue pixels
    relations:
      - separates: green_areas # Blue lines act as separators
  - type: areas
    id: green_areas
    properties:
      color: 3   # Green
    relations:
      - bounded_by: blue_lines
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Blue Lines:** Locate all blue (1) pixels in the input grid. These pixels form a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines.
2.  **Define Green Areas:** The blue lines divide the grid into multiple rectangular areas filled with green (3) pixels.
3.  **Select an Area**: I will assume the top left corner is selected
4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract the smallest green area.
5.  **Output:** The output is the selected subgrid.

Essentially, the blue lines act as borders, and the transformation extracts one of the smallest bounded green area as the output, which happens to be all green.
