Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the initial code against all training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it correctly identified the extraction logic for that specific case. However, the other examples reveal a flaw: the assumption that the 2x4 region of '3's is *always* adjacent to the upper-right *internal* corner of the orange border. The failure cases show extractions that are close but not quite right. It is clear that the extraction area is *inside* the border, but we will need a more robust method.

The general strategy will be to:

1.  **Refine Corner Detection:**  The current `find_upper_right_corner` function seems overly specific and brittle.  We need to robustly identify the inner border.
2.  **Object Identification:**  We'll try identifying the region of 3s as a coherent "object" and use its properties to determine the extraction.
3.  **Relationship-based Extraction**: Instead of relying solely on the corner, we'll use relationships between parts, the border, the inner empty space, and target 2 x 4 block.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the patterns better, let's use `code_execution` to get some concrete data about the input and output grids of each training example, focusing on the location of the 2x4 region of 3s, the overall dimensions, and corner locations.

I will also focus on the difference between the expected output and the actual output.

    max_row = np.max(border_coords[:, 0])

    max_col = np.max(border_coords[:, 1])

    for r, c in border_coords:
      if r > min_row and c < max_col:
        if grid[r-1,c] != 7 and grid[r, c+1] != 7:
          return r,c

    return None
