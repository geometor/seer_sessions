Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Yellow Stripes:** The grid is divided into vertical stripes that are 3 units wide. The pattern begins with two columns of any color, followed by a column of yellow.

2.  **Identify 2x2 Squares:** Locate 2x2 squares of green (3) or red (2) pixels within the grid.

3.  **Conditional Replication:**
    *   For each identified 2x2 square, determine the boundaries of the yellow stripe it resides in. The yellow stripe is the column of yellow pixels that either contains the square or, if the square starts to the left of a yellow column, includes the yellow column to the right of the start position.
    *   Replicate the 2x2 square bidirectionally *within* the yellow stripe.
    * The replication stops when it reaches the edge of the yellow stripe or another non-yellow pixel within that stripe. The replication moves 3 units at a time (one full stripe width).
    * If an object begins outside the yellow stripe (in the first two columns) it is replicated *into* the yellow stripe.

4.  **Preservation:** All other pixels remain unchanged.

5. **Output:** A new grid is created reflecting these changes.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the first training example. While it correctly captured the core concept of replicating 2x2 squares within yellow stripes, it made some incorrect assumptions that became apparent when applied to the other training examples. The main issues are:

1.  **Stripe Definition:** The initial program assumed stripes were always 3 units wide, starting with two non-yellow columns and then a yellow column. The provided examples show, and confirmed by the code, that the input grid is divided into 3 unit wide stripes. The yellow stripes appear to be related to the position of the 2x2 objects and aren't necessarily pre-existing.
2.  **Replication Logic:** The replication logic in the code is correct, replicating bidirectionally within a stripe.
3. **Object Selection** The code correctly selects 2x2 objects and colors.

The strategy for resolving these errors involves:

1.  **Refine Stripe Identification:** Correct the stripe definition and identification method. The stripes aren't pre-existing, but rather, defined relative to the position of the objects.
2.  **Maintain Replication Logic:** The core bidirectional replication logic within the now correctly calculated stripe is sound, keep it as is.

**Metrics and Observations**

To understand the results better, I'll gather some information using print statements inserted in the existing code. For brevity, I will only run the code on the training set.

**Code Execution Results and Analysis:**

The above code produces the following key results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   All objects (row, col): \[(5, 1)]
    *   Object at (5, 1) - color 3 - stripe\_start: -1, stripe\_end: 1
    *   Correct Result.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   All objects (row, col): \[(6, 0)]
    *   Object at (6, 0) - color 2 - stripe\_start: -1, stripe\_end: 1
    *   Correct Result.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   All objects (row, col): \[(6, 3)]
    *   Object at (6, 3) - color 3 - stripe\_start: 2, stripe\_end: 4
        *   Incorrect Result. The object should not be replicated.

Based on this and examining the grids, we can determine the accurate bounds of the yellow stripe by finding the nearest yellow (4) pixel column to the *right* of the 2x2 object's starting column, and then use that yellow column's position to calculate the stripe start and end.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - type: 2x2_square
    description: A 2x2 block of identical pixels.
    colors: [green, red]  # Observed colors for these squares.
    action: replicate
    constraints:
       - within_yellow_stripe

replication:
   direction: bidirectional # horizontally
   unit: 3 # moves by a full stripe width.
   bounds: "yellow_stripe"

yellow_stripe:
    width: 3
    defining_feature: "Contains a column of yellow (4) pixels. The stripe is *found* by looking for the nearest yellow column to the *right* of each 2x2 square."
    calculation: "Find the yellow column (c_yellow) to the right of the object. stripe_start = c_yellow - (c_yellow mod 3), stripe_end = stripe_start + 2."

grid:
  type: 2D_array
  cell_values: integers (0-9) # representing colors
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify 2x2 Squares:** Locate all 2x2 squares of green (3) or red (2) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Determine Yellow Stripe:** For each 2x2 square:
    *   Find the nearest column containing yellow (4) pixels to the *right* of the square's starting column. If no such column exists, the object does not get replicated.
    *   Calculate the yellow stripe boundaries based on this yellow column:
        *   `stripe_start = yellow_column - (yellow_column mod 3)`
        *   `stripe_end = stripe_start + 2`

3.  **Replicate within Stripe:** If a yellow stripe is found for a 2x2 square, replicate the 2x2 square bidirectionally (left and right) *within* that stripe.

    *   Replication occurs in steps of 3 units (the width of the stripe).
    *   Replication stops at the stripe boundaries or if it encounters a non-background pixel within the stripe.

4.  **Preservation:** All other pixels in the input grid remain unchanged.

5.  **Output:** Create a new grid reflecting these changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
