"""

import numpy as np

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example and focused on identifying clusters of non-blue, non-white pixels and duplicating some of them horizontally. The results on the other training examples reveal some limitations:

1.  **Incomplete Duplication:** The code only duplicates pixels to the right. Some examples might require duplication in other directions or different patterns.
2.  **Color-Specific Rules:** The duplication logic is color-specific (red, yellow, azure, maroon). The additional examples might introduce more color-based or position-based rules.
3.  **Ignoring Blue Regions:** The initial description mentions identifying clusters "within blue regions." While non-blue colors where the focus, the presence and position relative to the blue pixels isn't a component of the transform.
4. **Missing transformations**: other colors are affected but not yet included
   in the transformation rule

The strategy to address these issues involves:

1.  **Analyzing all examples:** Carefully examine *all* training input/output pairs to identify all applicable rules, not just the most obvious ones.
2.  **Generalized Duplication:** Explore different duplication patterns (left, up, down, diagonal) and conditions.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Develop more sophisticated conditional logic based on color, position, and potentially other pixel properties.
4.  **Refine the concept of clusters:** Reconsider whether the entire concept of clusters is needed. Perhaps individual pixels and their neighbors are a better starting point.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

To get precise information, I will use a simple python script and evaluate each example:

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Different Shapes"
    diff = grid1 != grid2
    return np.sum(diff)

def show_grid(grid):
    #shows the grid object as a string for compact view in this tool.
    return str(grid).replace(' [', '').replace('[', '').replace(']', '\n').replace(' ', ',')

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
task: 04b771f6
objects:
  - id: obj1
    color: blue
    description: background, static horizontal bars of blue
  - id: obj2
    color: red, yellow, azure, maroon, green
    description: pixels embedded within the blue horizontal bars that are duplicated 
    actions:
      - duplicate_right:
        conditions:
            color: [red, yellow]
            count: 1
      - duplicate_right:
        conditions:
            color: [azure, maroon]
            count: 3
      - duplicate_right:
        conditions:
            color: green
            count: 1
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Background:** The input contains horizontal blue bars that act as a background.
2. **Identify Pixels:** Find any non-blue pixels that are directly adjacent to blue pixels horizontally.
3. **Duplicate based on color**:
    -If the pixel color is red or yellow: Duplicate the colored pixel one position to the right.
    -If the pixel color is azure or maroon: Duplicate the colored pixel three positions to the right.
    -If the pixel color is green: Duplicate the colored pixel one position to the right.
4.  **Output:** Create the output grid by applying these duplication rules to the input grid.
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
