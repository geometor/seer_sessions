Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output grids consist primarily of background pixels of colors white (0) and azure (8).  Within this background, there are distinct 2x2 square blocks of pixels in red (2), blue (1), and green (3).  The key difference between the input and output seems to be the horizontal expansion or replication of these 2x2 colored blocks.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 20x20
      background_colors: [0, 8]
  - type: block
    properties:
      shape: 2x2 square
      colors: [1, 2, 3]
      initial_position: variable
      final_position: variable

actions:
  - name: replicate_horizontally
    properties:
      object: block
      condition: "color != 1"

relationships:
    - type: spatial
      description: Blocks are surrounded by background pixels.
    - type: transformation
      description:  Non-blue blocks are expanded horizontally.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all 2x2 square blocks of color within the grid. These blocks can be red (2), blue (1), or green (3).
2. **Conditional Replication:**
   - If a 2x2 block is red (2) or green (3), replicate it horizontally. Specifically, extend the block to the right by inserting an identical 2x2 block adjacent to the original.
    - If a block's original location has coordinates (r,c) for the upper left corner. After replication, there will be two adjacent blocks. One at location (r,c), the second at (r, c+2)
3. **Blue Block Preservation:** If a 2x2 block is blue (1), do not change it.  Leave it in its original position.
4. **Background Preservation:** All other pixels (the white and azure background) remain unchanged.

In short, the transformation rule is to horizontally duplicate the red and green 2x2 blocks, while leaving the blue 2x2 blocks and the background unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
