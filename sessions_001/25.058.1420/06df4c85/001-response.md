Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on object perception, relationships, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The primary colors observed are:

*   **Background:** White (0), Azure (8), Blue(1), Yellow(4)
*   **Object Colors:** Red (2), Green (3), Blue (1), Yellow (4), Maroon(9), Azure(8)

The objects appear to be $2\times2$ squares of non-background colors. The background seems to be a repeating tiled pattern of some sort, with lines of the same color and lines of alternating colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: square_object
    type: shape
    shape: square
    size: 2x2
    colors: [red, green, blue, yellow, maroon, azure]
    properties:
      - movable: false # Hypothesis: Objects don't change position relative to the background

  - name: background
    type: pattern
    pattern_type: tiled # Hypothesis: alternating colors and lines of the same color
    colors: [white, azure, blue, yellow]
    properties:
      - static: true
      - repeating: true

actions:
  - name: replicate_color
    description: Duplicate colors of existing squares within each tile
    parameters:
      - source: square_object
      - destination: tile

relationships:
 - subject: square_object
   relation: contained_within
   object: background_tile

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Background Tiles:** Divide the input grid into background tiles. By observation:
    *   In examples 1 and 3, the tile appears to be 3 rows x 6 cols
    *   In example 2, it seems that the background tiles are also 3 rows x 6 cols.

2.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all 2x2 squares of the same color that are distinct from the background colors.

3. **Replicate Object Color**: For each tile:
   * For each object that is partially in the tile
     * The colors within the tile are extended to all available columns

Based on the training examples this is the perceived rule.
