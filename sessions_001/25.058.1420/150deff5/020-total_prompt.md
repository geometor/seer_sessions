Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Gray Shapes:** Locate all contiguous shapes formed by the digit '5' (gray) in the input grid.  There may be multiple, distinct shapes.
2.  **Process Each Shape:** For *each* identified gray shape:
    a. **Find Extremes:** Determine the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates (horizontal positions) of the shape.
    b. **Split and Replace:** Replace the gray pixels within that shape.
        *   Pixels at the leftmost x-coordinate become '2' (red).
        *   Pixels at the rightmost x-coordinate become '8' (azure).
        *  Other pixels: those closer to leftmost are colored red (2), and those closer to rightmost, azure (8).
3.  **Maintain Background:** All other cells in the grid (those not part of any identified gray shape) remain unchanged.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the first attempt and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program correctly identified the core concept: finding gray shapes and modifying them based on their horizontal extent. However, the "closer to" logic for coloring pixels between the leftmost and rightmost points needs to be more robust, especially for the third example. The code generally works well for shapes that are wider than they are tall, but fails when the shapes have a more complex. The provided code works perfectly for examples 1 and 2, but completely fails on example 3, meaning that example 3 contains information essential to a robust solution.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Focus on Example 3:** Since the first two examples work correctly, Example 3 highlights the weakness in the current approach. We'll meticulously analyze the input and output of Example 3 to understand the precise transformation rule. It appears distance to edge might not be the main criteria for transformation, might be more complex.
2.  **Re-examine "Closeness":** The notion of "closer to" the leftmost or rightmost edge might be too simplistic. We may need to consider factors beyond simple horizontal distance. Explore alternative splitting or coloring criteria. Vertical position may matter.
3.  **Consider Shape Properties:** Might need to take height or width of shape into account.
4. **Updated YAML and Natural Language Program** create improved documents that accurately reflect how to solve all of the examples.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where needed):**

```python
import numpy as np

def describe_shape(shape_coords):
    """Provides a description of a shape's properties."""
    if not shape_coords:
        return "No shape"

    rows, cols = zip(*shape_coords)
    min_row, max_row = min(rows), max(rows)
    min_col, max_col = min(cols), max(cols)
    height = max_row - min_row + 1
    width = max_col - min_col + 1
    return f"Height: {height}, Width: {width}, Top-left: ({min_row}, {min_col}), Bottom-right: ({max_row}, {max_col})"

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task_name: Gray_Shape_Transformation
observations:
  - object_identification:
      - Gray (5) shapes in the input grid are the primary objects of interest.
      - Background pixels (non-5) are maintained.
  - object_properties:
      - Each gray shape has a leftmost and rightmost x-coordinate.
      - Gray shapes can have varying heights and widths.
  - actions:
    - color_leftmost: The leftmost pixels of a gray shape is changed to Red (2).
    - color_rightmost: The rightmost pixels of a gray shape is changed to Azure (8).
    - color_middle: The middle section of a gray shape might have a different pattern for coloring.
    - splitting: Gray shapes appear to be vertically split based on some rule.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Shapes:** Locate all contiguous shapes formed by gray (5) pixels in the input grid.

2.  **Process Each Shape:** For each identified gray shape:
    a.  **Find Extremes:** Determine the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates.
    b. **Leftmost Edge:** change the color the leftmost pixels to red (2).
    c. **Rightmost Edge:** Change the color of the rightmost pixels to azure (8).
    d. **Interior Pixels, first section**: If a gray pixel has the same x value of another pixel directly above or below, and is not on the rightmost edge, change color to red (2).
    e. **Interior Pixels, second section**: All remaining pixels are colored azure (8).

3.  **Maintain Background:** All other pixels (non-5) in the grid remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
