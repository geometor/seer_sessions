Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples. The initial natural language program and corresponding code were based on the first training example. Now we need to refine it based on how well it performs on *all* provided examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The code does a reasonable job on the first example, which it was designed for. However, the results on the other examples reveal that the transformation rule is more complex and nuanced than initially perceived. The core issue seems to be accurately identifying and processing the "inner" pixels of the gray object, particularly when there are variations in the shape and arrangement of the object. The initial assumption of simple horizontal lines within the object is not always valid. A strategy needs to consider objects of differing shape and size.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the discrepancies, I'll use a combination of observation and targeted code execution to analyze each example. I want to specifically look at:

1.  **Object Identification:** Is the gray object correctly identified in each case?
2.  **Outer Pixel Detection:** Are the outer pixels correctly identified and colored azure?
3.  **Inner Pixel Processing:** How does the code's logic for handling inner pixels differ from the actual transformation in the example?
4.  **Unchanged Pixels:** Are pixels that should remain unchanged (e.g., white pixels) actually left unchanged?

Here's a breakdown of each example, including calculated metrics:

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def calculate_metrics(input_grid, predicted_output_grid, expected_output_grid):
    """Calculates pixel-wise accuracy and discrepancy details."""
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    predicted_output_grid = np.array(predicted_output_grid)
    expected_output_grid = np.array(expected_output_grid)

    correct_pixels = np.sum(predicted_output_grid == expected_output_grid)
    total_pixels = input_grid.size  # Use input_grid size for consistency
    accuracy = correct_pixels / total_pixels

    discrepancies = []
    for r in range(expected_output_grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(expected_output_grid.shape[1]):
            if predicted_output_grid[r, c] != expected_output_grid[r, c]:
                discrepancies.append({
                    "row": r,
                    "col": c,
                    "predicted": int(predicted_output_grid[r, c]),
                    "expected": int(expected_output_grid[r, c]),
                    "input": int(input_grid[r,c])
                })

    return accuracy, discrepancies
