Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) to another 2D grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains a shape formed by the digit '5' (gray) on a background of '0' (white). The output grid seems to maintain the same shape, but the '5's are replaced by '2's (red) and '8's (azure). The '2's form the left side of 3 and the 8's form the right part of the 3.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    shape: 9x9
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    shape: 9x9
  - object: shape
    color_input: 5 (gray)
    color_output_left: 2 (red)
    color_output_right: 8 (azure)
    background: 0 (white)
  - action: color_replacement
    details: Replace a contiguous shape of a specific color with other color.
  - relationship: same_shape
    details: The input and output grids have the same shape.
  - relationship: shape_splitting:
      detail: the shape is formed by the digit 5 is splitted verticaly and each part is replaced by another digit.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate the contiguous shape formed by the digit '5' (gray) in the input grid.
2.  **Split and Replace:** Replace the gray colored pixels. The left part of the shape is replaced by '2's (red) and the right part by '8' (azure). A pixel belong to the left or right part based on a vertical split.
3.  **Maintain Background:** All other cells in the grid, which have the value '0' (white), remain unchanged.
4. **Vertical split reference:** to determine which pixels of the shape get the color on the left or right, we locate the leftmost and right most pixels of the shape. The x coordinate of leftmost pixel will form the reference to color with the left color and the x coordinate of the rightmost pixel will be the reference to color the right color. The shape's pixels that have and x between these 2 extreme values, will be assigned the color associated with the closest extreme.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
