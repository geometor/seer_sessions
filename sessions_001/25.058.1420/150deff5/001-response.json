The primary element is a single connected \"object\" composed of grey (5) pixels in the input grid. This object undergoes a color transformation, resulting in two distinct colored regions within the original object's shape in the output grid. The colors used for replacement appear to be azure (8) and red (2), with the assignment depending on the shape and position of the input object and adjacent colors.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
