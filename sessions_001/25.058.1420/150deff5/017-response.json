            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying a contiguous shape of '5' (gray) and splitting it vertically, replacing parts with '2' (red) and '8' (azure). However, the provided results indicate some discrepancies. The code generally works, but it needs to address cases where there are multiple groups of 5s.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Multiple Shapes:** The core issue seems to be the presence of multiple distinct shapes of color '5'. The current code only considers one shape. We need to modify the program to handle multiple shapes of 5s independently.\n2.  **Refine Splitting Logic:** Double check how we split and that the left and right coloring is always performed correctly.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Observations (using code execution for accuracy):**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_results(input_grid, output_grid, expected_output_grid):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes the results and provides metrics.\"\"\"\n\n    # Check if output matches expected output\n    match = np.array_equal(output_grid, expected_output_grid)\n\n    # Find shapes in input, output, and expected output\n    input_shapes = find_shapes(input_grid, 5)\n    output_shapes_2 = find_shapes(output_grid, 2)\n    output_shapes_8 = find_shapes(output_grid, 8)\n\n    expected_output_shapes_2 = find_shapes(expected_output_grid, 2)\n    expected_output_shapes_8 = find_shapes(expected_output_grid, 8)\n\n    print(f\"  Match: {match}\")\n    print(f\"  Input shapes (5s): {len(input_shapes)}\")\n    print(f\"  Output shapes (2s): {len(output_shapes_2)}\")\n    print(f\"  Output shapes (8s): {len(output_shapes_8)}\")\n    print(f\"  Expected output shapes (2s): {len(expected_output_shapes_2)}\")\n    print(f\"  Expected output shapes (8s): {len(expected_output_shapes_8)}\")\n\ndef find_shapes(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous shapes of the specified color and returns as list where\n    one item contains coordinates for one shape\n    \"\"\"\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    if len(coords) == 0:\n        return []\n\n    shapes = []\n    visited = set()\n\n    def dfs(row, col, current_shape):\n        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= col < grid.shape[1]) or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        current_shape.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, current_shape)\n        dfs(row -

If the pixel's x-coordinate is max_x, change its color to 8 (azure).\n            iii. Otherwise, if the pixel's x is closer to min_x, color it 2 (red).\n            iv. Otherwise, color it 8 (azure).\n    output:\n      - red_shape\n      - azure_shape\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Gray Shapes:** Locate all contiguous shapes formed by the digit '5' (gray) in the input grid.  There may be multiple, distinct shapes.\n2.  **Process Each Shape:** For *each* identified gray shape:\n    a. **Find Extremes:** Determine the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates (horizontal positions) of the shape.\n    b. **Split and Replace:** Replace the gray pixels within that shape.\n        *   Pixels at the leftmost x-coordinate become '2' (red).\n        *   Pixels at the rightmost x-coordinate become '8' (azure).\n        *  Other pixels: those closer to leftmost are colored red (2), and those closer to rightmost, azure (8).\n3.  **Maintain Background:** All other cells in the grid (those not part of any identified gray shape) remain unchanged.\n\nThe key improvement is explicitly handling *multiple* gray shapes and applying the splitting and replacement logic to each one independently. The previous program treated all 5s as a single connected shape. Also improved the clarity of the description.\n"
