The left part of the shape is replaced by '2's (red) and the right part by '8' (azure). A pixel belong to the left or right part based on a vertical split.\n3.  **Maintain Background:** All other cells in the grid, which have the value '0' (white), remain unchanged.\n4. **Vertical split reference:** to determine which pixels of the shape get the color on the left or right, we locate the leftmost and rightmost pixels of the shape. The x coordinate of leftmost pixel will form the reference to color with the left color and the x coordinate of the rightmost pixel will be the reference to color the right color. The shape's pixels that have and x between these 2 extreme values, will be assigned the color associated with the closest extreme.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_shape(grid, color):\n    # Find coordinates of pixels with the specified color.\n    coords = np.argwhere(grid == color)\n    return coords\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions and background color.\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n\n    # Find the shape formed by '5' (gray).\n    shape_coords = find_shape(input_grid, 5)\n\n    if len(shape_coords) > 0:\n      #find the leftmost and rightmost x coordinates\n      min_x = np.min(shape_coords[:, 1])\n      max_x = np.max(shape_coords[:, 1])\n\n      # Replace '5's with '2's (red) or '8' (azure) based on the vertical split\n      for r, c in shape_coords:\n          if c == min_x:\n            output_grid[r,c] = 2\n          elif c == max_x:\n            output_grid[r, c] = 8\n          elif abs(c - min_x) < abs(c-max_x):\n            output_grid[r, c] = 2\n          else:\n            output_grid[r, c] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
