"""
1.  **Identify the Red Rectangle:** Locate the rectangular region within the input grid that is bounded by red (color value 2) pixels.

2.  **Extract and Sample:** Extract the region of the input grid defined by the *interior* of the red rectangle. The output is generated by sampling pixels within this extracted sub-grid using an at-the-moment unknown sampling rule. The colors of the output pixels are from colors in the subgrid.

3. **Sampling Rule**: The sampling does not look regular, which means that there isn't an easy rule to compute indices from one grid to the other. Since there are very few examples, the sampling rule could be a complex combination of row and columns selection. I think a 'fitting' algorithm could be more successful than a direct geometrical rule computation.
