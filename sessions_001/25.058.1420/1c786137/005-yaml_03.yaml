facts:
  - object: red_rectangle
    description: A contiguous block of red (value 2) pixels forming a rectangle.
    properties:
      color: 2 (red)
      shape: rectangular
      solidity:  Must be a solid rectangle (all internal pixels are red)

  - object: interior_region
    description: The region inside the red_rectangle, excluding the red border.
    properties:
        derivation: Extracted from the input_grid based on red_rectangle bounds.

  - object: output_grid
    description: The transformed grid.
    properties:
        relationship: Derived from the interior_region, likely via a sampling or mapping process.

  - action: find_rectangle
    description: Locates the red_rectangle in the input_grid.
    input: input_grid
    output: Bounding box coordinates (top_left, bottom_right) or None if no rectangle is found

  - action: extract_interior
    description: Extracts the interior region of the red_rectangle.
    input: input_grid, top_left, bottom_right
    output: interior_region (a sub-grid)

  - action: transform
    description:  The overall transformation, combining find_rectangle, extract_interior and an as-yet-undetermined mapping of the interior to output.
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

  - observation_1:
    example: 1
    note: "Output dimensions are larger than interior dimensions."

  - observation_2:
    example: 2
    note: "Output is the first two rows of interior"

  - observation_3:
      example: 3
      note: "Output is exactly the interior."

  - observation_4:
    example: 4
    note: "Output is exactly the interior"
