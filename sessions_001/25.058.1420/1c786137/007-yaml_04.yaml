facts:
  - task: "Extract and transform the interior of a red rectangle within a grid."
  - objects:
    - name: "Input Grid"
      properties:
        - "A 2D array of integers representing colors."
        - "Contains a single solid rectangle of red pixels (value 2)."
    - name: "Red Rectangle"
      properties:
        - "Defined by a contiguous block of red pixels."
        - "Serves as a boundary for the region of interest."
    - name: "Interior Region"
      properties:
        - "The sub-grid contained within the Red Rectangle, excluding the boundary."
        - "Its dimensions vary across examples."
        - "Its pixel values vary across examples."
        - "height can be 1 or more"
        - "width can be 1 or more"
    - name: "Output Grid"
      properties:
        - "A 2D array of integers representing colors."
        - "Derived from the Interior Region through an as-yet-undetermined transformation."
        - "Dimensions are not always the same as the Interior Region."
        - "contents are not always the same as the Interior Region"
  - actions:
    - "Locate the Red Rectangle within the Input Grid."
    - "Extract the Interior Region from the Input Grid."
    - "Transform the Interior Region into the Output Grid (details TBD)."
  - constraints:
      - "There is only 1 red rectangle"
      - "if interior height is 1 or 2, output = interior"
      - "if interior height is 3, output rows may not match interior"
