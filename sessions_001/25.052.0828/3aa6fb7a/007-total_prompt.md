"""
This program transforms the input grid as follows:
1. It identifies all objects of color 8 (azure) in the input grid.
2. For each azure object:
    - If the object is a vertical line, a blue (color 1) pixel is placed immediately to the right of the top-most cell of the object.
    - If the object is a horizontal line or an L-shape, a blue pixel is placed immediately to the left of the right-most cell of the object.
3. All other cells in the input grid remain unchanged.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
