"""
The transformation can be described as a "decoration" rule centered around the initial red and blue cells. The red cell gets a yellow cross, the blue cells are sorrounded by orange cells in the four cardinal directions.

1. Copy the red and blue cells from the input grid.

2. Create a yellow cross centered on the position of the red cell from the input grid, extending one cell in each cardinal direction.

3. Create a set of four orange cells surrounding the blue cell in the input grid, one cell away in each cardinal direction.

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
