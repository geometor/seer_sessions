Ignore other color.\n2.  **Yellow Cross Creation:** For *each* red cell, create a cross pattern using yellow (color 4) cells.  The cross extends one cell in each cardinal direction (up, down, left, and right) from the red cell.\n3.  **Orange Surround:** For *each* blue cell, place orange (color 7) cells around it in each of the cardinal directions.\n4.  **Preservation**: The magenta cell, and all red and blue cells remain in the same place.\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule remains consistent. We apply the \"decoration\" rule around every red and blue cell, and leave any other cells untouched.\n\n1.  Copy all cells from the input to the output.\n\n2.  For each red cell in the input grid:\n    *   Place a yellow cell one position above, below, to the left, and to the right of the red cell's location.\n\n3.  For each blue cell in the input grid:\n    *   Place an orange cell one position above, below, to the left and to the right of the blue cell's location.\n"
