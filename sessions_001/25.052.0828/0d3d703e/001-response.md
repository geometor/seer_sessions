Okay, let's analyze the transformation from the input grid to the output grid.

**Observations and Documentation**

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial findings:

```yaml
input_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 3 (green)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 1 (blue)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)

output_grid:
  size: 3x3
  objects:
    - color: 4 (yellow)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0)
    - color: 5 (gray)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)
    - color: 6 (magenta)
      shape: vertical line
      position: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2)
```

**Determining the Transformation Rule**

The transformation rule appears to be a simple color mapping or substitution. Each color in the input grid is consistently replaced by a different, specific color in the output grid:

*   Green (3) is replaced by Yellow (4).
*   Blue (1) is replaced by Gray (5).
*   Red (2) is replaced by Magenta (6).

The shape and position of the objects (vertical lines in this case) remain unchanged. The transformation only affects the color of the cells.

**Natural Language Program**

Here's a step-by-step natural language description of the transformation:

1.  **Identify Objects:** For each column (or vertical line of cells) in the input grid, identify its color.
2.  **Color Substitution**: Replace the color of each column by the corresponding color as follows:
    *   If color is Green (3), change to the column to Yellow (4)
    *   If color is Blue (1), change to the column to Gray (5)
    *   If color is Red (2), change to the column to Magenta (6)
3. **Preserve Structure**: Maintain the shape of each column during transformation.

This transformation is memoryless. Previous states are irrelevant and all objects of the same type are treated the same.
