Previous Code:
```python
"""
Iterates through each pixel of the input grid. If a pixel is blue (value 1),
a 3x3 block of pixels centered on that pixel's location in the output grid is
created.

The pixel at the center of the 3x3 block remains blue (1).
The pixel immediately to the left of center becomes gray(8)
The pixel immediately above and to the left of the center becomes red (2).
The pixel directly above the center becomes orange(7)
The pixel directly above and to the right of center becomes magenta (6).

Pixels in the output grid that are not part of any 3x3 block created
retain their input value, implicitly zero.
If two or more 3x3 block overlap, pixels are re-written according to the final
overlapping transformation.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
