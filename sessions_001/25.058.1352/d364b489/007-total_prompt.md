Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialization:** Begin with the output grid being an exact copy of the input grid.

2.  **Blue Pixel Identification:** Iterate through each pixel of the *input* grid. Identify pixels that are blue (color value 1).

3.  **3x3 Pattern Application:** For *each* blue pixel found:
    *   Overwrite the corresponding pixel in the *output* grid with a '1' (blue).
    *   If possible (i.e., not exceeding grid boundaries), set pixels in the *output* grid relative to the blue pixel's location as follows:
        *   One pixel up and one pixel to the left: set to 2 (red).
        *   One pixel up: set to 7 (orange).
        *   One pixel up and one pixel to the right: set to 6 (magenta).
        *   One pixel to the left: set to 8 (gray).

4. **Pixels Not Modified:** If a pixel is not part of the 3x3 transformation triggered by any blue pixel in the input, the output retains its input value.

5. **Overlapping Transformations:** If multiple blue pixels trigger transformations that would modify the same location, the transformation associated with the final processed blue applies.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
