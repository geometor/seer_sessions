objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
      - dimensions: variable height and width

  - name: blue_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: 1 (blue)
      - role: seed for color expansion

  - name: white_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: 0 (white)
      - role: can be transformed based on proximity to blue pixels (or pixels colored from blue pixels)

  - name: colored_pixel
    type: cell
    properties:
      - color: determined by relative position to expanding pixel
      - role: becomes a new expanding pixel

actions:
  - name: color_expansion
    description: >
      Expands colors from blue pixels (and subsequently colored pixels) to
      adjacent white pixels based on a deterministic rule.
    parameters:
      - source_pixel: The pixel initiating the expansion (initially blue, later any colored pixel)
      - target_pixel: The white pixel being colored.
      - direction: The relative position of the target pixel to the source (Up, Down, Left, Right).
    rules:
      - Up: target pixel becomes 2 (red)
      - Down: target pixel becomes 6 (magenta)
      - Left: target pixel becomes 7 (orange)
      - Right: target pixel becomes 8 (azure)

  - name: iterative_process
    description: The color expansion happens iteratively until no more white pixels can be colored.
