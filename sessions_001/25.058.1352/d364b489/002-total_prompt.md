<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1340x1330 at 0x7ACD21382030>Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output examples and discern the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single-digit integer (0-9), representing different colors. The primary change observed between the input and output grids is the replacement of the blue (1) pixels with a 3x3 block of pixels with colors orange (7), blue (1), and magenta (6) arranged in sequence horizontally, and red(2), white(0), azure(8) vertically, centered on the original blue pixel. All of the original '0' value pixels remain '0'.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 10x10
      - cells: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replace_pixel
    input:
      - object: pixel
        property: color = blue (1)
    output:
      - object: 3x3 subgrid
        properties:
          - center: original pixel position
-         - arrangement:
            - row 1: [orange(7), blue(1), magenta(6)]
            - row 2: [red(2), white(0), azure(8)]
            - row 3: depends on existing data in this position in the grid.

relationships:
 - type: spatial
   description: the output subgrid replaces the input pixel, centered at its location.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** Iterate through each cell of the input grid. Locate all pixels with the value 1 (blue).

2.  **Create Replacement Block:** For each identified blue pixel, create a 3x3 block of pixels.

3.  **Populate Replacement Block:**
    *   The center cell of the 3x3 block will get a value of '0' (white).
    *   The top row of the block is colored: orange (7), blue (1), magenta (6).
    *    The middle row is: red (2), white (0), and azure (8).
    *   The values for the bottom row seem to be the top row of the pattern, rotated clockwise by one position for each successive blue pixel transformation. The first occurrence has the values [red(2), white(0), azure(8)]. The next has the values [orange(7), blue(1), magenta(6)]. The full pattern appears to repeat, as seen in example 2.

4.  **Replace Pixel:** Replace the original blue pixel in the input grid with this newly created 3x3 block, centered at the blue pixel's original location.

5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the grid that are not blue (value 1) remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
