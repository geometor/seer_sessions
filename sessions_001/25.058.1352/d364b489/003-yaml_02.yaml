actions:
  - name: transform_pixel
    input: single pixel (color 1)
    output: 3x3 block of pixels
    transformation_rule: >
        Input blue pixel at (r, c) becomes a 3x3 block centered at (r, c)
        in the output grid.
        The 3x3 block has a specific color pattern:
          - Top Left: 2
          - Top Middle:7
          - Top Right: 6
          - Middle Left:8
          - Center: 1
          - Middle Right: (empty - see next point)
          - Bottom Left: (empty - see next point)
          - Bottom Middle: (empty - see next point)
          - Bottom Right: (empty - see next point)
    constraints: >
      Some cells in the 3x3 block created can be overwriten by
      later applications of this rule
      Only cells with values from the input grid can have the rule applied, others are
      left as their original value.

relationships:
    -  input pixel position (r, c) maps to the center of a 3x3 block in the output grid.
