Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and made some specific assumptions:

1.  It assumed that *all* gray objects should be replaced.
2.  It assumed a *specific* 3x3 red/yellow pattern for replacement.
3.  It assumed the replacement size is always 3x3, regardless of the gray object.
4. It assumed mirroring would occur, and implemented that over the center row.

The test results clearly show these assumptions are incorrect, because some test cases did not execute successfully, meaning that there was an out of bounds write. Looking at the input and output example pairs, it is clear that it only operates on square shapes, and the replacement size matches the original object's bounding box size.

The strategy to resolve this is as follows:

1.  **Refine Object Selection:** Instead of assuming *all* gray objects, the code should identify which gray objects are transformed.
2.  **Adaptive Replacement:** The replacement pattern and size should be determined by the original object's size, rather than hardcoded.
3. **Remove mirroring.** Mirroring does not occur.
4. **Bounds checking:** Add bounds checking using the original gray object shape to make sure writes do not extend beyond that.

**Metrics and Observations**
Here's a breakdown of each example, including an execution report to get accurate metrics:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):
    """Analyzes an example and provides metrics."""

    report = {
        'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
        'output_shape': output_grid.shape,
        'predicted_shape': predicted_grid.shape if predicted_grid is not None else None,
        'success': np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_grid) if predicted_grid is not None else False,
    }

    # Find gray objects in the input
    def find_objects(grid):
        objects = []
        visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)

        def dfs(row, col, color, obj_pixels):
            if (row < 0 or row >= grid.shape[0] or col < 0 or col >= grid.shape[1] or
                    visited[row, col] or grid[row, col] != color):
                return
            visited[row, col] = True
            obj_pixels.append((row, col))
            dfs(row + 1, col, color, obj_pixels)
            dfs(row - 1, col, color, obj_pixels)

  - general:
      rule: >
        Only square gray objects are replaced. The replacement uses red and yellow pixels and the shape of the replacement is a square with same dimensions as the source gray object.  The replacement pattern forms an "L" shape using red along the top and left, and yellow along bottom and right.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Gray Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of gray (color 5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Filter for Squares:**  From the identified gray objects, select only those that form a perfect square (width equals height).
3.  **Determine Replacement Size:** For each square gray object, the replacement size is identical to the dimensions of that gray square.
4.  **Create Replacement Pattern:** The replacement pattern is a square of the determined size, filled with red (2) and yellow (4) pixels. An "L" shape is created in the top left corner, filling the top row with red and the leftmost column with red, except the top-left corner is red. Similarly, an inverted "L" shape of yellow occupies the bottom right corner.
5. **Replace:** Replace the gray square object in the input grid with the generated replacement pattern.
6.  **Leave other objects unchanged.**  Any gray object that is *not* a square is left as-is.

This refined program addresses the issues observed in the test results by being more precise about *which* objects are transformed and *how*.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
