There are distinct \"objects\" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The colors involved are white (0), red (2), yellow (4), and gray (5). The transformation seems to involve a substitution of gray objects by colored ones of the same shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The top right pixel is red, the pixel to the left is red. The pixel below this one is yellow.\n6. **Mirror**: gray objects are mirrored along x axis.\n\nIn summary, gray objects will be replaced by a certain color configuration while maintaining relative position and mirroring along the x axis.\n"
