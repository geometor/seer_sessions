Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are both 10x10 grids.
*   The input grid contains pixels of colors white (0), gray (5), magenta (6), and azure (8).
*   The output grid contains pixels of colors white (0), magenta (6), and azure (8). Gray (5) is no longer present, and locations where gray was present is now one of the colors (6) or (8).
*    It appears a shape defined by color 5 in the input image is being replaced by color 6 and 8.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output are 10x10 grids.
  - object: shape1
    property: color: gray (5)
    location: top right corner and center
    action: replaced
  - object: shape2
    property: color: magenta (6)
    location: various
    action: expands into gray area
  - object: shape3
      property: color: azure (8)
      location: various
      action: expands into gray area
  - relation: shape2 and shape3 replace parts of shape 1 based on an unknown criteria.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Locate the magenta (6) and azure (8) pixels within the input image.
3.  Iterate the gray area. For each gray pixel
   a. Replace the gray area (5) by either majenta (6) or azure (8) according to the original colors of input.

Essentially the input is a map of gray areas to be recolored with colors that are present.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
