Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are grids of size 15x14.\n*   Most of the grid cells are filled with '0' (white).\n*   The input grid contains a cluster of non-zero colored pixels in the center.\n*    The input has single cells with colors yellow (4), azure(8), red(2), and green(3). The red, green, and azure colors are arranged in a horizontal line; a yellow cell is on top of the azure.\n*   The output grid has a similar, but vertically elongated and mirrored structure. The 3 x 1 horizontal sequence of red, green, and azure becomes a 1 x 3 vertical sequence. The sequence is then duplicated (and include the yellow above the azure) across the entire vertical space of the output grid.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically, identify the horizontal sequence of red (2), green (3), and azure (8), and the yellow (4) positioned above the azure (8).\n\n2.  **Vertical Elongation:** In the output grid, starting from the center row, replace the central column pixels. Transform the horizontal sequence '2 3 8' into a vertical sequence, with '2' at the bottom, '3' above it, and '8' above '3'. Place '4' (yellow) directly above '8'.\n\n3. **Vertical Duplication**: Copy that vertical sequence of 2, 3, 8 and 4 in the center column of the output. Make copies up and down from the center. Make sure all the available rows in the output have pixels in the center defined in this color sequence.\n\n4.  **Horizontal Duplication:** Duplicate this established 4-color pattern up to the available grid boundaries.\n\n5. **Horizontal Seed Extension**: Create the horizontal sequence in the middle.\n\n6. **Copy and Extend Vertically**: Extend to the available rows the sequence 3, 8, 4, 2.\n\n7.  **Fill Remaining:** Leave all other cells in the output grid as '0' (white).\n"
