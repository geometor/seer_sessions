The primary element is a connected \"object\" or \"shape\" composed of non-zero pixels. In the examples, this object appears to be the focus of the transformation. The background is composed of '0' (white) pixels. The object seems to consist of adjacent pixels forming a contiguous block. The critical observation is the replication and rearrangement of this object within the output grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n"

The replication maintains the original object's color sequence and relative pixel positions. The row chosen for replication seems consistently positioned vertically within the grid (e.g., row 4 in the first example, row 6 in second example).\n\nThe key is identifying the input object, and then repeating it horizontally while moving the extracted vertical bar. The background remains unchanged (filled with 0s).\n"
