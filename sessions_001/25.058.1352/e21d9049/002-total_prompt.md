<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1660x1970 at 0x7ACD213822B0>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements**

The task involves 2D grids containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary element is a connected "object" or "shape" composed of non-zero pixels. In the examples, this object appears to be the focus of the transformation. The background is composed of '0' (white) pixels. The object seems to consist of adjacent pixels forming a contiguous block. The critical observation is the replication and rearrangement of this object within the output grid.

**YAML Fact Block**


```yaml
facts:
  - domain: 2D grid
  - elements:
    - background:
        value: 0
        color: white
    - object:
        definition: connected non-zero pixels
        properties:
          - colors: [red, blue, green, azure, yellow] # Observed colors
          - shape: irregular, contiguous
  - transformation:
    - description: Object replication and arrangement.
    - steps:
      - 1: Identify the connected non-zero pixels (the object).
      - 2: Extract a vertical bar of pixels, and place at output's matching x coordinates.
      - 3: Replicate the entire input object along a single row of the output grid, repeating the sequence of object's pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the contiguous block of non-zero pixels within the input grid. This forms the primary "object."

2.  **Extract Vertical Bar, Copy**: Locate the vertical bar crossing with original object, and copy to corresponding x coordinates in the output grid.

3.  **Replicate Horizontally:** Replicate the entire initial object horizontally across a single row in the output grid. The replication maintains the original object's color sequence and relative pixel positions. The row chosen for replication seems consistently positioned vertically within the grid (e.g., row 4 in the first example, row 6 in second example).

The key is identifying the input object, and then repeating it horizontally while moving the extracted vertical bar. The background remains unchanged (filled with 0s).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
