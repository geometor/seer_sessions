facts:
  - object: cluster
    description: The contiguous block of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
    properties:
      color:
        - Consistently gray (value 5) across all examples.
      shape:
        - Rectangular.
      size:
        - Varies in height and width across examples.
      location:
        - Varies across examples.
  - action: expansion
    description: The cluster's color expands to fill a larger rectangular region in the output grid.
    properties:
      direction:
        - Both horizontal and vertical.
      extent:
        - The output rectangle's height is determined by adding the original
          cluster's height and the output's row which the top of the cluster would be.
          The width extends to match the width of input grid.
      color_source:
        - The color of the cluster (gray/5) is used for the expansion.
