The input grid contains a cluster of non-zero pixels (8, 3, and 2 - azure, green, and red, respectively) in the top-left quadrant, surrounded by zeros (white). The output grid retains the original cluster but also extends it. Specifically, the fifth row of the input, containing `8 3 2`, appears to be replicated horizontally to fill the rest of that row. Moreover, a vertical mirrored expansion is observed, where the non-zero section of the first three rows ( `8`, `3` and a column containing `3`, `2` on rows 2,3 and 8 on rows 1 ) are mirrored downwards along column 3.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
