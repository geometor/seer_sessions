Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Core:** Find the smallest rectangular region enclosing all non-zero pixels in the input grid. This is the "core" cluster.
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:**
    *   Locate the row in the output grid that corresponds to the *bottom* row of the core cluster in the input grid.
    *    Replicate the values of that row *from the input grid* across the entire width of the output grid on the corresponding row.
3. **Vertical Fill (Example 1 Only):**
      *   The first training example included filling of the column below the cluster with colors from that column
      *    This appears to be unique to this example.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
