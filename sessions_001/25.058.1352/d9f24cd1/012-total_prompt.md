Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of size 10x10.
*   The grids contain digits 0, 2, and 5, representing white, red, and gray colors, respectively.
*   The most noticeable change is the propagation or filling of '2' (red) in areas where '0' (white) was present.
*   The locations of '5' (gray) appear to influence where the '2' (red) values are placed. The '2' values expand.
*   The output grid maintains the original gray pixels, they are unchanged
*   The white pixels in the bottom row of the input that had the value '2' are unchanged in the output, except adjacent to '5'.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: [0, 2, 5]
  - id: gray_pixels
    value: 5
    role: boundary/influence
    change: none
  - id: red_pixels
    value: 2
    role: expanding
    change: propagate from the original location
  - id: white_pixels
    value: 0
    role: background
    change: replaced by 2 based on the location of the gray and original red
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Gray Pixel Preservation:** Identify all pixels with the value '5' (gray). These pixels remain unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Red Pixel Expansion:**
    *   Locate the red pixels ('2') in the bottom row.
    *   All white pixels ('0') above this bottom row of red are changed to red ('2').
4. **Gray Influence**
    *   Red pixels ('2') replace white pixels ('0') on the same row and directly adjacent.
5.  **Output:** The resulting grid is the output.

In essence, the transformation rule involves preserving the gray pixels and using original red pixels to expand upward to fill the whole column, and spread horizontally adjacent to the gray.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
