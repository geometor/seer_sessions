Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Copy the grid:** Start with a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve gray pixels** Keep existing gray (5) pixels in their original positions.
3. **Fill red columns:** In the output grid, make every other columns that have red pixels, to only contain red pixels.
4. **Propagate to gray Columns:** Take every gray (5) pixel. If there is space on either side of it, Fill the whole column with 2 (red).
5. If a column has both red and gray, fill every empty (0) cell to the left of the gray with red.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code have several issues. While it correctly identifies the importance of red and gray pixels, the logic for filling columns and propagating colors is flawed and doesn't generalize across all examples. The current strategy seems to overfit to the first example and doesn't handle variations in object placement and grid structure. The main strategy should include finding the gray and red pixels first and using them as "anchors" for actions, however, the conditional actions are not correctly executed.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refocus on Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes an "object" in each example (contiguous blocks of the same color).
2.  **Re-evaluate Conditional Logic:** The conditions for filling columns with red and propagating colors based on gray pixels need to be re-examined and corrected. The current left and right fill is too excessive.
3.  **Prioritize Gray, Then Red:** The gray pixels seem to be the primary "anchor," influencing the placement of red.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Test the revised natural language program and code after each example, making adjustments as needed.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately analyze the results, I need to compare the provided code execution on the examples with the given ground truth outputs.

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Find columns with red pixels
    red_cols = []
    for c in range(cols):
        for r in range(rows):
            if output_grid[r,c] == 2:
                red_cols.append(c)
                break;

    # Fill those columns with red
    for c in red_cols:
        for r in range(rows):
            output_grid[r, c] = 2

    # Iterate through gray pixels
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if output_grid[r, c] == 5:
                # Fill current column with red up to the gray pixel
                for r_above in range(r):
                  output_grid[r_above,c] = 2
                
                #Fill to left with red.
                for c_left in range(c):
                    output_grid[r,c_left] = 2
                
                # Check left and right and fill the columns
                if c > 0:
                    for r_index in range(rows):
                        output_grid[r_index,c-1] = 2

                if c < cols-1:
                    for r_index in range(rows):
                        output_grid[r_index, c+1] = 2


    return output_grid

 [2 5 2]
 [2 2 2]]
Correct: True

 [[0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 5 0]
 [0 0 2 0]
 [0 0 0 0]]
Expected Output:
 [[2 2 2 2]

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: gray_pixel
    color: gray (5)
    role: primary_anchor
    behavior: Determines the column where it resides.

  - object: red_pixel
    color: red (2)
    role: secondary_anchor
    behavior: Appears adjacent to gray pixels

  - action: fill_column
    trigger: presence of gray_pixel
    result: The entire column containing the gray pixel, becomes red.

  - action: conditional_fill
    trigger: presence of red_pixel in same column as gray pixel.
    result: red extends throughout entire column.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Gray Pixels:** Identify all gray (5) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Fill Gray Column:** For each gray pixel, fill the entire column it occupies with red (2).

```python
import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    output_grid = np.full(input_grid.shape, 2)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape
    for r in range(rows):
      for c in range(cols):
        if input_grid[r,c] == 5:
          output_grid[r,c] = 5

    return output_grid
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
