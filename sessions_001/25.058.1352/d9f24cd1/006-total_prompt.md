Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (10x10).
*   The grids contain numerical values representing colors (0-9). Most of the grid is 0 (white), with a few cells of 2 (red) and 5 (gray).
*   The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid.
*   The locations of the gray (5) pixels seem to influence, or seed, the placement of red (2) pixels in the output.
*    There are 2's (red) at the bottom of the input

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            2: red
            5: gray

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: [white, red, gray]
      - position: [row, column]

actions:
  - name: copy_and_modify
    description: The input grid is copied to the output grid, with modifications.
  - name: propagate_color
    description: Red (2) pixels are added or maintained, influenced by the position
     of gray cells and other red cells.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description:  The relative positions of gray and red pixels determine
      the transformation. Gray pixels seem to be preserved, and
      red pixels fill every column, with a certain pattern.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy the grid:** Start with a copy of the input grid.
2.  **Preserve gray pixels** Keep existing gray (5) pixels in their original positions.
3. **Fill red columns:** In the output grid, make every other columns that have red pixels, to only contain red pixels.
4. **Propagate to gray Columns:** Take every gray (5) pixel. If there is space on either side of it, Fill the whole column with 2 (red).
5. If a column has both red and gray, fill every empty (0) cell to the left of the gray with red.

Essentially, the red pixels from the bottom row get copied to the rest of its respective column.
And the gray pixels cause the propagation of red, from their own position, towards the beginning of rows and to their adjacent columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
