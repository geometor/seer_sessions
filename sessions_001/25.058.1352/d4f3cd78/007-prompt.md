Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify the Hollow Square: Find the hollow square object formed by gray (5) pixels.
2. Fill the Square: Fill the interior of this square with azure (8) pixels.
3. Define Modification Region: Determine the columns spanned by the identified square (from the square's leftmost column to its rightmost column).
4. Modify Last Two Rows: In the last two rows of the grid, change the color of white (0) pixels to azure (8), but *only* within the columns determined in step 3.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
