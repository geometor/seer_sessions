The primary colors observed are white (0), blue (1), and green (3). The transformation seems to involve a relationship between the blue (1) pixels in the input and the placement of green (3) pixels in the output. The green pixels seem to form a '+' shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Example 1\n    *   using a 1 (blue) as an endpoint. Example 2\n\n3.  **Construct Green Cross:** If the center of cross is existing blue, then\n   add four green (3) around the center of blue pixels in a plus-sign (+) configuration:\n    *   One green pixel directly above the determined center.\n    *   One green pixel directly below the determined center.\n    *   One green pixel directly to the left of the determined center.\n    *   One green pixel directly to the right of the determined center.\n4.  **Output Grid:** Create an output grid identical to the input grid. Replace the appropriate cells, using the position of the green crosses, by the value '3'. Retain other cells like 1.\n\nBased on example 2, I hypothesize case 2 will work well, because, if there are more than 2 blue pixels, cross using different pairs would intersect.\n"
