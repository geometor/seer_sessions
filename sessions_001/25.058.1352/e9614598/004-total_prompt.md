Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid is mostly empty (filled with 0s, representing white). It contains two blue pixels (1s) horizontally aligned near the center. The output grid introduces green pixels (3s) forming a cross-like shape centered between the two blue pixels. The blue pixels remain in their original positions. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    color: blue (1)
    initial_positions: [(4,1), (4,7)] # (row, col)
  - type: pixel
    color: green (3)
    created_positions:  # Positions where green pixels are created
      - (3, 4)
      - (4, 4)
      - (5, 4)
      - (4, 3)
      - (4, 5)
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    background: white (0)

actions:
  - type: create
    object: green pixel
    positions: relative to blue pixels
  - type: preserve
    object: blue pixel
    positions: original

relationships:
  - green_cross_center: midpoint of blue pixels
  - green_pixel_adjacency:  adjacent to each other forming a cross
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the two blue pixels (value 1) in the input grid.
2.  **Calculate** the midpoint between the two blue pixels.
3.  **Create** a green pixel (value 3) at the calculated midpoint.
4.  **Create** four additional green pixels (value 3) directly adjacent (above, below, left, and right) to the central green pixel, forming a cross shape.
5. **Preserve** all other pixels, including the original two blue, as they were in their original positions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
