Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved radiating gray lines from a central azure pixel. The results on the other training examples show that this program works perfectly for the other examples too, even when the initial position of the azure pixel and grid sizes are changed.

Since the program correctly captured the intended transformation on all available examples, we can be confident that the solution is correct. The strategy therefore will be focused on improving the description of the logic.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the results:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid with a single azure pixel at (4, 4).
    *   Output: 9x9 grid with gray lines radiating from the center, forming a combined "X" and "+" shape. The center remains azure.
    *   Result: Perfect match.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 13x13 grid with single azure pixel at (6,6).
    *   Output: 13x13 grid with gray lines radiating and the center azure.
    *   Result: Perfect match.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 9x9 grid with a single azure pixel at (0,4).
    *   Output: 9x9 grid with gray lines radiating, center is azure.
    *   Result: Perfect Match.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_grid_size: 9x9
      start_pixel_color: azure (8)
      start_pixel_location: (4, 4)
      output_pattern: "Combined X and + shape formed by gray (5) pixels radiating from the start pixel. Start pixel remains azure."
      result: "Perfect match"
  - example_2:
      input_grid_size: 13x13
      start_pixel_color: azure (8)
      start_pixel_location: (6, 6)
      output_pattern: "Combined X and + shape formed by gray (5) pixels radiating from the start pixel. Start pixel remains azure."
      result: "Perfect match"
  - example_3:
      input_grid_size: 9x9
      start_pixel_color: azure (8)
      start_pixel_location: (0, 4)
      output_pattern: "Combined X and + shape formed by gray (5) pixels radiating from the start pixel. Start pixel remains azure."
      result: "Perfect match"
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate the Azure Pixel:** Find the single azure (8) pixel within the input grid. This pixel serves as the origin point.
2.  **Radiate Gray Lines:** From the azure pixel's location, draw gray (5) lines extending outwards in all eight directions: horizontally (left and right), vertically (up and down), and diagonally (all four diagonal directions).
3. **Extend to Boundaries:** Continue these gray lines until they reach the edges of the grid.
4. **Preserve start:** The initial azure pixel should remain.

The transformation creates a pattern that combines a cross ("+") and an "X" shape, centered on the original azure pixel, with the lines extending to the grid boundaries. The azure pixel remains in the center, and does not get colored by the radiating.
