Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. While it performed partially correctly on some of the other examples, it failed to generalize the complete transformation rule. The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example. The original rule for extending gray cells assumed they only go upward and leftward, and diagonally upwards and leftwards. The code review shows the transformation also happens downwards, rightwards, and diagonally, downwards, rightwards.

The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Examine each input-output pair, noting where the code's output matches the expected output and, more importantly, where it deviates.
2.  **Object Identification:** Clarify the role of the azure cell (the "seed") and how the grey cells interact with it and the grid boundaries.
3.  **Rule Refinement:** Modify the natural language program to accurately describe the grey cell expansion in all directions (up, down, left, right, and all diagonals) from the seed cell until a border is encountered.
4.  **Metrics Gathering**: use code execution to get dimensions of the grids and locations of key colors, like the seed and other important information.

**Metrics Gathering and Example Analysis**

I'll use code execution to gather information about each example and then analyze the results.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: seed
    color: azure (8)
    description: The starting point for the transformation.  Its position in the input grid is maintained in the output grid.
  - object: grey_fill
    color: grey (5)
    description:  Expands from the seed cell's location in all directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) until the edge of the grid is reached.
  - grid_size:
    description: The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - transformation_rule:
    description:  The grey color (5) fills outward from the seed cell (8) in all directions, stopping at the grid boundaries.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate the Seed:** Find the azure (8) cell within the input grid. This cell is the "seed" for the transformation.
2.  **Preserve the Seed:**  The seed cell's position and color (azure) are unchanged in the output grid.
3.  **Expand Grey Fill:** From the seed cell's location, fill all adjacent cells with grey (5).
4.  **Iterate Expansion:** Continue expanding the grey fill outwards in all directions (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) from every grey cell.
5.  **Boundary Condition:** Stop the expansion of grey at the edges of the grid.  The expansion does *not* wrap around.
6. All other cells remain their original color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
