            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a refined natural language program and a YAML block summarizing the observations:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the azure pixel as the origin of an \"L\"-shaped gray path. However, it only implemented a few hardcoded \"L\" shapes, and does not generalize to all the variations in the training examples. The core issue is that direction and length of the \"L\" are not determined algorithmically, but with fixed if/else blocks. The updated strategy will involve:\n\n1.  **Analyzing all examples**: Determining the relationship between the azure pixel's location and the \"L\" shape's orientation and dimensions across *all* training examples.\n2.  **Developing a general rule:** Finding pattern that explains the transformation.\n3. **Refactoring existing code:** The function `find_azure_pixel` is working correctly. The `transform` function needs modification of how to draw the \"L\".\n\n**Example Metrics and Results**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including a description of what actually happened vs. the expected behavior of the current code. I'll refer to rows and columns starting from index 0.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Azure Pixel: (5, 5)\n    *   Output \"L\": Extends upwards and left.\n    *   Code Result: Correct. The `if r > 2 and c > 2` condition matches.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Azure Pixel: (5, 5)\n    *   Output \"L\": Extends downwards and left\n    *   Code Result: Correct. The `if r < 10 and c > 2` condition matches.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Azure Pixel: (5, 5)\n    *   Output \"L\": Extends downwards and right\n    *   Code Result: Correct. The `if r < 10 and c < 10` condition matches.\n\nAll the examples currently work, but only because of hard coded directions. A general approach will be necessary to pass the test data. The azure pixel is always at (5, 5), so we do not have adequate information to generalize at the current time.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: azure_pixel\n    properties:\n      color: azure (8)\n      role: origin\n      location: varies # (row, col) coordinates\n    description: The starting point for the transformation.\n\n  - object: gray_L_shape\n    properties:\n      color: gray (5)\n      shape: L\n      orientation: variable # up-left, down-left, down-right, up-right\n      length: variable  # Length of each segment of the L\n    description: The shape created in the output, originating from the azure pixel.\n    related_to: azure_pixel\n\n  - task: create_L_shape\n    input: input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n    action: draw_L\n    agent: gray_L_shape\n    description: An L-shaped path of gray pixels is created, starting from the azure pixel.\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Find the Azure Pixel:** Locate the single azure pixel (color value 8) within the input grid. This pixel serves as the origin point (the corner) of the \"L\" shape.\n\n2.  **Determine \"L\" Orientation and Dimensions:** The orientation (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right) and the length of each segment of the \"L\" vary. *We do not yet have enough information to define the general rule.*\n\n3.  **Draw the \"L\" Shape:** Starting from the azure pixel's location, draw an \"L\"-shaped path using gray pixels (color value 5). The \"L\" consists of two perpendicular line segments.\n\n4.  **Output:** The output grid is a copy of the input grid with the added gray \"L\" shape. All other pixels remain unchanged.\n"
