Okay, here's my analysis of the first example pair, focusing on perception, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 13x13 grid. Most cells are white (0), except for a single azure (8) cell near the center.
*   **Output:** A 13x13 grid. The azure (8) cell remains in the same position. There are grey (5) cells forming a kind of "inverted-L" or "mirrored-L" shape, extending upwards, leftwards, and upwards-leftwards from the azure cell. The grey shapes include the original coordinates and expands until any non zero cell is found.
* **Transformation:** It appears the azure cell acts as a seed, and the grey color "grows" or "floods" from it in specific directions, filling in the original shape.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    size: 13x13
    elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - object: seed_cell
    color: azure (8)
    property: stationary, origin point for transformation
    input_coordinates: [3,4]
    output_coordinates: [3,4]
  - object: filled_cells
    color: grey (5)
    property: replaces white (0) cells, forms a specific shape
    relation_to_seed: expands upwards, leftwards, and upwards-leftwards.
  - action: fill
    agent: seed_cell (implied)
    target: white (0) cells
    direction: up, left, up-left (diagonal)
    result: change color to grey (5)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate the azure (8) cell in the input grid. This is the "seed" cell.
2.  Maintain the position and color of the seed cell in the output grid.
3. From the position of the seed cell start creating grey cells.
4. Extend grey cells upwards until a non zero cell is found or the border is met.
5. Extend grey cells to the left until a non zero cell is found or the border is met.
6. Extend grey cells diagonally upwards and leftwards, creating grey blocks upwards, and leftwards. All the way to the border.
7.  All other cells in the input grid remain unchanged.
