**Perception of Elements:**

The core element is a 2D grid of single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors. The primary object is a vertical line of '7's (orange). The transformation seems to involve adding '8' (azure) pixels adjacent to the '7's, primarily above them, and shifting/expanding the 7's and 8's to form the new shape. The rest of the grid is filled with '0' (white).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: vertical_line
    color: 7  # orange
    shape: vertical line
    initial_position: variable column
    height: variable

  - id: adjacent_pixels
    color: 8 # light blue
    shape: single pixels
    initial_position: adjacent to vertical_line

  - id: background
    color: 0
    shape: fill remaining grid cells
    initial_position: all cells not occupied other objects

actions:
  - name: add_adjacent
    object: adjacent_pixels
    target: vertical_line
    rules:
      - add 8 above 7, and add 8 to the left and right of 7 when 7 is not at the border of image
      - add 7 to the left or right when 7 is at left or right of border

  - name: fill background
    object: backgound
    target: empty cells

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Find the vertical line of orange (7) pixels. Note its height and starting column.
2.  **Add/Transform:**
    *   Iterate through the original orange line from top to bottom. For each orange pixel: Add an azure (8) pixel above it.
    *   If the orange (7) is not on an edge (left or right boundary), add an azure (8) to the left and to the right.
    *   If the orange (7) pixel is at the left edge of grid, add a '7' to its left.
    *   If the orange (7) pixel is on the right edge, add a '7' to its right.
3. Fill background: keep all other pixels to '0'.

The program describes a mirrored and expanded adjacent filling based on the orange line.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
