The primary object is a vertical line of '7's (orange). The transformation seems to involve adding '8' (azure) pixels adjacent to the '7's, primarily above them, and shifting/expanding the 7's and 8's to form the new shape. The rest of the grid is filled with '0' (white).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

For each orange pixel: Add an azure (8) pixel above it.\n    *   If the orange (7) is not on an edge (left or right boundary), add an azure (8) to the left and to the right.\n    *   If the orange (7) pixel is at the left edge of grid, add a '7' to its left.\n    *   If the orange (7) pixel is on the right edge, add a '7' to its right.\n3.
