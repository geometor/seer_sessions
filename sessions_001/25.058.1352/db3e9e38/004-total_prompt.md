Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The primary colors involved are white (0), orange (7), and azure (8). The input grid contains a vertical line of orange pixels in the center, while the output grid introduces azure pixels around the orange ones, creating a sort of "cross" or "plus" shape centered on the original orange line. The shape and size of the input influence the shape of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x7 (rows x columns)
      elements: pixels
      colors: [white, orange, azure]

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

  - type: vertical_line
    properties:
      color: orange
      length: 4
      start_position: (0, 3)
      end_position: (3, 3)

actions:
  - type: surround
    description: "Place azure pixels around orange pixels."
    parameters:
      source_color: orange
      target_color: azure

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "The azure pixels are placed adjacent to the orange pixels, both horizontally and vertically."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the orange (7) pixels in the input grid. These form a vertical line.
2.  **Copy** the original input grid to create the output grid
3.  For each orange pixel in the output grid:
    *   Change the color of pixels directly above and below it, if present, to azure(8).
    *   Change the colors of the pixels left and right of it, if present, to azure(8).
4. All the original orange pixels remain.

In other words, we are outlining the existing orange line of pixels, both on the sides, and, above and below, changing adjacent pixels to azure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
