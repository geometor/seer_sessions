The input grids contain gray (value 5) pixels on a white (value 0) background. The output grids seem to replace those gray pixels with 3x3 blocks of blue (value 1) pixels, centered on the original gray pixel's location, but the white pixels are unchanged. There is also a combination view.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Identify the coordinates (row, column) of all pixels with a value of 5 (gray).\n3. **Replace with Blue Blocks:** For each gray pixel found:\n    a. Calculate the top-left corner coordinates of a 3x3 block, centered on the gray pixel. This is done by subtracting 1 from both the row and column of the gray pixel.\n    b. If the top-left, bottom-right, or intermediate cells of the block are out of bounds, use `0` value, otherwise use a value of 1.\n    c. Replace the gray pixel and its surrounding 8 neighbors in a 3x3 area with blue pixels (value 1) at the calculated position.\n4. **Output:** The resulting grid, after all gray pixels have been replaced, is the output grid. Keep `0` values unchanged.\n\n**Combination View:**\n\n1. The four images represent the 2 input grids, and the two output grids.\n"
