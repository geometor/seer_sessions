Okay, I will analyze the provided input and output grids to understand the transformation. Here's my plan:

1.  **Examine the Grids:** I'll visually inspect the input and output grids, noting the positions and colors of the pixels. I'll pay close attention to any changes.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Based on the "objectness" prior, I'll consider contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color as objects.
3.  **Describe Changes:** I'll describe how the objects in the input grid have changed in the output grid. This might involve changes in color, position, size, or shape.
4. **Formulate NL Program:** I will write a concise natural language program of the transformation.

Here's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:



```yaml
observations:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [7, 7]
      objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
          shape: irregular, two separate blobs
  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [7, 7]
      objects:
        - color: azure (8)
          positions: [[1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]
          shape: irregular, two separate blobs
        - color: blue (1)
          positions: [[1,2], [4,4]]
          shape: two single pixels

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all azure (8) colored pixels in the input grid.
2.  Locate azure pixels that are alone, meaning that they do not touch any other azure pixel, even diagonally.
3.  Change the color of those single azure pixels to blue (1).
4. All other pixels remain unchanged.
