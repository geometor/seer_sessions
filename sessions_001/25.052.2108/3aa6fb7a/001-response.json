Here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Examine the Grids:** I'll visually inspect the input and output grids, noting the positions and colors of the pixels. I'll pay close attention to any changes.\n2.  **Identify Objects:** Based on the \"objectness\" prior, I'll consider contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color as objects.\n3.  **Describe Changes:** I'll describe how the objects in the input grid have changed in the output grid. This might involve changes in color, position, size, or shape.\n4. **Formulate NL Program:** I will write a concise natural language program of the transformation.\n\nHere's a YAML block summarizing my initial observations:\n\n"
