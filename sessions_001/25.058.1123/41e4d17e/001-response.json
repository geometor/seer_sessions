The dominant colors are azure (8) and blue (1). Magenta (6) appears in the output grids. The input grids contain blue shapes on an azure background. The output grids add magenta elements while retaining the blue shapes from the input, with some modifications.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

It could be open on one or more sides, which are connected.\n3. **Locate Mid points**. Find the y coordinate of shape 1.\n4.  **Add Magenta Markings:**\n    a. Place magenta around a blue shape\n    b. create a line that intersects all the points on the y axis\n    c. create a line around the shape by using all the points that are adjacent to it\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies the y level of the blue shape, and creates magenta lines adjacent to it. The magenta outlines the shape.\n"
