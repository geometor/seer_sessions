Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    - object_1:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (1,1) # Top-left corner of the object
    - object_2:
        color: 8 (azure)
        shape: L-shape
        position: (3,4) # Top-left corner of the object
  output_grid:
      - object_1:
          color: 8 (azure)
          shape: L-shape
          position: (1,1)
      - object_2:
          color: 8 (azure)
          shape: L-shape
          position: (3,4)
      - object_3:
          color: 1 (blue)
          shape: single cell
          position: (1,2)
      - object_4:
          color: 1(blue)
          shape: single cell
          position: (4,5)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we can see two L-shaped objects made of azure (color 8) pixels.

2.  **Preserve Objects:** These objects keep shape, color and location in the output grid.

3. **Add blue pixel:** In the output, a blue pixel (color 1) appears on the right of the corner of each object.

**Transformation Rule (In Natural Language):**

The transformation preserves the two azure L-shaped objects, maintaining their original positions and shapes. Additionally, it adds a single blue pixel (color 1) to the right of each object's corner, in both cases.
