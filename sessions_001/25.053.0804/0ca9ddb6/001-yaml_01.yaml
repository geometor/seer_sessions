transformations:
    - create yellow pixels:
        - description: "Yellow pixels are created based on the position of the red pixel."
        - relative_positions: "One row above and one column to the left and right.  And, one row below, one column to the left and right"

    - create orange pixels:
        - description: "Orange pixels are created based on the position of the blue pixel."
        - relative_positions: "One row above, same column; Same row, one column left and right, one row below, same column"
