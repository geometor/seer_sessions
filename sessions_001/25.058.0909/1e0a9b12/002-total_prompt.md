Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 4x4 grids. Both input and output grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary change seems to be the rearrangement of non-zero colored pixels, while the zero-valued (white) pixels seem to act as a background or filler. The non-zero pixels maintain original colors. It seems the non-zero pixels are gathered in the bottom right, while the zero pixels are in the upper left.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: rearrange_pixels
    description: Moves non-zero pixels to specific locations.
    parameters:
        destination: bottom-right

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Non-zero pixels are consolidated, leaving zero-valued pixels elsewhere.
  - type: color_preservation
    description: The color of each non-zero pixel remains unchanged during the rearrangement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Locate all non-zero pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** Maintain a record the color and original location of each non-zero pixel.
3. **Clear:** Make all of the input image zero
4.  **Rearrange:** reposition the non-zero pixels to the bottom right of the grid, filling empty spaces from the left of the row to the right, and rows from the bottom row and up, preserving the color of the original cells.
5. **Fill:** Ensure any unassigned spaces is filled with white pixels.

In summary, the transformation rule involves extracting all non-zero pixels from the input grid and repositioning them at the bottom-right corner of the output grid, maintaining their original colors, filling empty spaces with zero-value pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
