            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on observations from the *first* training example. By testing against *all* training examples, we've identified discrepancies. The core concept of anchor (yellow/orange) and mover (azure/maroon) pixels is still valid, but the movement rules need adjustment, especially for the maroon ('9') pixel. The original logic incorrectly assumed '9' *always* moves adjacent to '8' if '8' moves. The additional examples reveal a more complex interaction.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Carefully re-examine *all* examples:** Pay close attention to the initial and final positions of *all* colored pixels, not just '8' and '9'. Look for consistent patterns in how '9' moves (or doesn't move) relative to '8', the anchors, and the grid boundaries.\n2.  **Refine movement rules:** Develop a more precise rule for '9''s movement that accounts for all observed cases. Consider edge cases and constraints.\n3.  **YAML and Natural Language Program Update:**  Document the revised observations and create a natural language program that reflects the updated, more accurate transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using hypothetical code execution - actual would happen in the code phase, this is just to organize the analysis)**\n\nSince I'm in the \"dreamer\" phase, I can't *actually* execute code. I'll simulate what I *would* do with code execution to gather metrics and will describe the results I'd expect. This is critical for informing the later coding phase.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Already analyzed, but included for completeness)\n    *   `Input`: '8' at (2,2), '9' at (2,3), '4' at (4,2), '7' at (5,2).\n    *   `Expected Output`: '8' at (3,2), '9' at (3,3), '4' at (4,2), '7' at (5,2).\n    *   `Actual Output`: '8' at (3,2), '9' at (3,3), '4' at (4,2), '7' at (5,2).\n    *   `Result`: **Correct**.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   `Input`: '8' at (1,3), '9' at (1,4), '4' at (3,3), '7' at (4,3).\n    *   `Expected Output`: '8' at (2,3), '9' at (1,4), '4' at (3,3), '7' at (4,3).\n    *   `Actual Output`: '8' at (2,3), '9' at (2,4), '4' at (3,3), '7' at (4,3).\n    *   `Result`: **Incorrect**. '9' moved when it should not have.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   `Input`: '8' at (4,6), '9' at (4,5), '4' at (2,6), '7' at (3,6).\n    *   `Expected Output`: '8' at (5,6), '9' at (4,5), '4' at (2,6), '7' at (3,6).\n    *   `Actual Output`: '8' at (5,6), '9' at (5,7), '4' at (2,6), '7' at (3,6).\n    *   `Result`: **Incorrect**. '9' moved when it should not have, and also moved to an incorrect location.\n\n**Key Observation from discrepancies:** '9' *only* moves if it starts to the *right* of '8'. If '9' starts to the *left* of '8', it does *not* move, even if '8' moves.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 08ed6ac7\nobjects:\n  - id: anchor_group\n    color: [yellow, orange]\n    properties:\n      - static: true\n      - adjacent: vertically\n    initial_positions:\n      - example_1: [(4,2), (5,2)]\n      - example_2: [(3,3), (4,3)]\n      - example_3: [(2,6), (3,6)]\n  - id: mover_8\n    color: azure\n    properties:\n      - static: false\n      - movement: vertical_down\n    initial_positions:\n      - example_1: (2,2)\n      - example_2: (1,3)\n      - example_3: (4,6)\n  - id: mover_9\n    color: maroon\n    properties:\n      - static: conditionally  # Key change\n      - movement: conditional_adjacent_right\n    initial_positions:\n      - example_1: (2,3)\n      - example_2: (1,4)\n      - example_3: (4,5)  # Left of '8'\n    movement_conditions:\n      - \"mover_9 moves only if its initial column is greater than mover_8's initial column\" #very explicit description\n\ngrid_properties:\n  - background: white\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Anchors:** The yellow ('4') and orange ('7') pixels form a vertically adjacent anchor group. These pixels do not change position.\n\n2.  **Identify Movers:** The azure ('8') and maroon ('9') pixels are potential movers.\n\n3.  **Move '8':** Move the azure ('8') pixel down as far as possible within its *original column*. It stops when it reaches the bottom edge of the grid or another non-white pixel.\n\n4.  **Move '9' (Conditionally):**\n    *   Check if '9' is initially to the *right* of '8' (i.e., '9''s initial column index is greater than '8''s initial column index).\n    *   If '9' is to the right of '8', move '9' to the cell immediately to the right of the *new* position of '8'.\n    *   If '9' is *not* to the right of '8', '9' does *not* move.\n\n5.  **Preserve Background:** All other white ('0') pixels remain unchanged.\n"
