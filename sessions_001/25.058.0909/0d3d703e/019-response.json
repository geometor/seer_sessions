Each grid cell contains a single digit, representing a color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve a one-to-one mapping of colors/digits.  There's no obvious spatial transformation (like rotation, reflection, etc.). The black borders seem to be irrelevant.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
