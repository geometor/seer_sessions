Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the information, strategy, and documentation for the provided task, focusing on incorporating the results from all training examples:

**General Assessment**

The initially generated code implements a simple color substitution (3->4, 1->5, 2->6). This works perfectly for all training examples. This suggests the core transformation rule is a direct color mapping. The strategy is to codify this mapping in a clear, concise natural language program and subsequently in Python code.

**Metrics and Observations (Inferred from the perfect validation result, no need for extra code execution)**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 4x4
    *   Output Shape: 4x4
    *   Color Changes: All greens (3) become yellow (4), all blues (1) become gray (5), and all reds (2) become magenta (6).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x5
    *   Output Shape: 3x5
    *   Color Changes: All greens (3) become yellow (4), all blues (1) become gray (5), and all reds (2) become magenta (6).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 4x6
    *   Output Shape: 4x6
    *   Color Changes: All greens (3) become yellow (4), all blues (1) become gray (5), and all reds (2) become magenta (6).

Since the code produced perfect results, the transform function already embodies the complete transformation rule.

**YAML Documentation**

```yaml
task_description:
  task_id: color_mapping_simple
  objects:
    - name: grid
      description: A 2D array of pixels.
      properties:
        - property: color
          description: Represents the color of a pixel, ranging from 0-9.
  actions:
    - name: color_substitution
      description: Replaces specific color values with new ones.
      details:
        - original_color: 3 (green)
          new_color: 4 (yellow)
        - original_color: 1 (blue)
          new_color: 5 (gray)
        - original_color: 2 (red)
          new_color: 6 (magenta)
  transformation_rule: >
    The transformation rule involves a direct color substitution within the
    grid. The colors green (3), blue (1), and red (2) are consistently replaced
    with yellow (4), gray (5), and magenta (6) respectively.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input:** A grid of pixels, where each pixel has a color value (0-9).
2.  **Process:** For each pixel in the input grid:
    *   If the pixel's color is green (3), change it to yellow (4).
    *   If the pixel's color is blue (1), change it to gray (5).
    *   If the pixel's color is red (2), change it to magenta (6).
    *   Otherwise, leave the pixel's color unchanged.
3.  **Output:** A grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, but with the specified color substitutions applied.

The code provided accurately represents the natural language program. No changes are needed as a perfect solution was achieved on all examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
