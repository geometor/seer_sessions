Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a direct color substitution.  The following mapping is applied consistently across all input pixels:

1.  Maroon (9) is replaced with Azure (8).
2.  Yellow (4) is replaced with Green (3).
3.  Red (2) is replaced with Magenta (6).
4.  All other colors remain unchanged.

The size and shape of the grid do not change. The transformation operates on each pixel independently, based solely on its initial color value.
"""

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies a color substitution to the input grid based on a predefined mapping.
    """
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]

    # Define the color mapping.
    color_map = {
        9: 8,
        4: 3,
        2: 6,
    }

    # Iterate through each cell of the grid.
    for i in range(len(output_grid)):
        for j in range(len(output_grid[0])):
            # Check if the current color is in the mapping.
            if output_grid[i][j] in color_map:
                # Apply the color substitution.
                output_grid[i][j] = color_map[output_grid[i][j]]

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
