Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. Each cell within the grids contains a single digit, representing a color. The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation appears to involve a consistent change in the digits (and therefore colors) across the entire grid. There's no indication of object movement, rotation, or complex spatial reasoning. It seems to be a simple color substitution.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: digits (0-9) representing colors
  - observation: input and output grids have identical dimensions
  - transformation_type: color substitution
  - mapping:
      input:
        2: red
        3: green
        8: azure
      output:
        6: magenta
        4: yellow
        9: maroon
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color substitution. Each digit in the input grid is replaced by a corresponding digit in the output grid according to the following mapping:

1.  Replace all instances of digit '2' (red) with digit '6' (magenta).
2.  Replace all instances of digit '3' (green) with digit '4' (yellow).
3.  Replace all instances of digit '8' (azure) with digit '9' (maroon).

The spatial arrangement of the digits is preserved; only the digit values (colors) are changed.
