Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the perceived transformation rule for the provided example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input and Output Grids:** Both input and output are 9x9 grids.
*   **Colors/Values:** The grids contain numerical values representing colors, with '0' being the most prevalent (background). Other colors present are azure (8), blue (1), red (2), yellow(4), and orange(7).
*   **Objects:** Non-zero pixels appear to form individual objects or clusters.
*	**Changes:** The output grid shows new instances, and modification of the colors of pixels near, and specific to, the non-zero values.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  grid_size:
    width: 9
    height: 9
  input_objects:
    - color: 8 #azure
      positions: [[0,3]]
    - color: 1 #blue
      positions: [[3,2]]
    - color: 2 #red
      positions: [[2,6],[7,1]]
      
    - color: 1
      positions: [[6,6]]
  output_objects:
      - color: 8
        positions: [[0,3]]
      - color: 1
        positions: [[3,2]]
      - color: 2
        positions: [[2,6],[7,1]]
      - color: 4
        positions: [[1,5],[1,7],[3,5],[3,7],[8,0],[8,2],[6,0],[6,2]]
      - color: 7
        positions: [[2,2],[3,1],[3,3],[5,6],[6,5],[6,7],[7,6]]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Iterate** through each of the original non-zero pixels found.
3.  **Check** the locations of the pixel values of '1', and '2'.
4.  **Introduce** a new '7' (orange) colored pixel in the output grid in all empty spaces (value 0) adjacent to the locations.
5. **Check** the locations of the pixel values of '1', and '8'.
6. **Introduce** a new '4' (yellow) colored pixel in the output grid, in the locations that complete a 3x1 or 1x3 cluster, if a straight line of two empty spaces exists between the locations.
7. **Copy** all original pixel values to the output.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
