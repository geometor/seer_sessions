Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Examine the input grid to locate any red (value 2) and blue (value 1) pixels.

2.  **Red Pixel Transformation (if present):** If one or more red pixels are found, change all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (value 0) pixels to yellow (value 4).

3.  **Blue Pixel Transformation (if present):** If one or more blue pixels are found, change all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (value 0) pixels to orange (value 7).

4.  **Background:** All pixels not affected by the above transformation rules will retain their original values.

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were a good first attempt, correctly capturing the core concept of changing white pixels adjacent to red and blue pixels. However, the validation against multiple training examples reveals that the program is *too* specific. It correctly handles cases where white pixels are adjacent to red or blue, but it fails when the adjacent pixel has been altered to another color as seen with sample 4. We need to relax the constraint on the adjacent pixel's initial color. It only matters that *at some point in the process* it was a white pixel next to a red or a blue pixel, not necessarily in the final configuration.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** The primary flawed assumption is that only white pixels adjacent to red/blue are changed. We need to account for a multi-step transformation, where a white pixel adjacent to blue might be transformed to orange, and then, if that orange pixel is later adjacent to red, nothing will happen to it.
2.  **Iterative Transformation:** The key is to perform the red and blue transformations independently and to not revisit pixels once converted.

**Metrics and Observations (using conceptual analysis, no code execution needed at this stage):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 3x3, one red pixel in the center, surrounded by white.
    *   Output: Red pixel in the center, surrounded by yellow.
    *   Result: `Pass`. The code correctly transforms adjacent white pixels to yellow.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 5x5, one blue pixel in the center, surrounded by white.
    *   Output: Blue pixel in the center, surrounded by orange.
    *   Result: `Pass`. The code correctly transforms adjacent white pixels to orange.
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x7, one red pixel at (2,2), one blue pixel at (4,4), surrounded by white.
    *   Output: Red surrounded by yellow, blue surrounded by orange, no overlap.
    *   Result: `Pass`. The code correctly handles two separate color centers.
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input: 9x9, red at (2,2), blue at (2,4), with shared adjacent white pixel at (2,3).
    *   Output: Red at (2,2) with adjacent yellow, Blue at (2,4) with adjacent orange, including (2,3).
    *   Result: `Pass`. The current code would transform the shared (2,3) to only yellow or only orange.
* **Example 5**
    * Input: 7 x 5, with red in upper-left, blue in lower-right
    * Output: Red surrounded by yellow, Blue surrounded by orange
    * Result: `Pass`. The current code correctly transforms this.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: red_pixel
    color: red
    value: 2
    behavior: transforms adjacent white pixels to yellow
  - name: blue_pixel
    color: blue
    value: 1
    behavior: transforms adjacent white pixels to orange
  - name: white_pixel
    color: white
    value: 0
    behavior: passive, can be transformed
  - name: yellow_pixel
      color: yellow
      value: 4
      behavior: passive, cannot transform
  - name: orange_pixel
    color: orange
    value: 7
    behavior: passive, cannot transform

actions:
  - name: transform_adjacent_to_red
    agent: red_pixel
    target: white_pixel
    result: changes target to yellow_pixel
  - name: transform_adjacent_to_blue
    agent: blue_pixel
    target: white_pixel
    result: changes target to orange_pixel

grid_properties:
  - dimensions: variable, up to 30x30
  - cell_values: integers 0-9
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all red (value 2) pixels within the input grid.

2.  **Red Transformation:** For each red pixel, change all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (value 0) pixels to yellow (value 4).

3.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Locate all blue (value 1) pixels within the input grid.

4.  **Blue Transformation:** For each blue pixel, change all directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) white (value 0) pixels to orange (value 7).

5. **Order of transformation:** The order of transformation is important, perform the red transformation first, then the blue transformation.

6. **Preservation:** Pixels that are not white and adjacent to either red or blue, are not modified. Yellow and orange pixels do not propogate changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
