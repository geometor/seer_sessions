Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identify existing colored pixels (non-white pixels) in the input grid.

For each colored pixel:

- If the colored pixel is blue (1), place orange (7) pixels adjacent to it, both horizontally and vertically, if empty.
- If the colored pixel is red (2), place a yellow(4) pixels adjacent, both horizontally and vertically, if empty.
- Magenta (6) is not affected, it is copied to same place.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a reasonable interpretation of the first training example. However, testing against the full training set reveals that the transformation rule is more nuanced.  The initial program correctly identifies that blue pixels get orange neighbors and red pixels get yellow neighbors. However, the code applies the rules to *all* the red and blue pixels. Reviewing the examples suggests that the transform is applied only to *specific* occurrences of the red and blue pixels.

**Strategy**:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis**: Carefully examine each input/output pair in the training set, paying close attention to *which* blue and red pixels are triggering the neighbor changes.
2.  **Identify Selection Criteria**: Determine the criteria (e.g., position, proximity to other colors, shape) that determine *which* blue and red pixels have their neighbors modified.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program**: Rewrite the program to precisely capture the complete, accurate transformation rule, including these selection criteria.
4. **Update Code** Based on testing and verification, and update the `transform` function to implement the revised rules, using the refined natural language program.

**Metrics and Observations**

To gain more concrete insights, let's examine the grids. I won't execute code here in the dreamer phase; that's for the coder phase. However, I'll simulate what I *would* do with code execution to get metrics, and describe the anticipated observations. I cannot see the visualizations, so I will perform a manual examination of the text data.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: blue (1)
    shape: single pixel
    behavior: "Adds orange (7) neighbors, vertically and horizontally, if not blocked"
    constraints: "Only adds to the blue at the center of a cross of empty space."

  - color: red (2)
    shape: single pixel
    behavior: "Adds yellow (4) neighbors, vertically and horizontally, if not blocked"
    constraints: "Only adds to the red at the center of a cross of empty space."

  - color: magenta (6)
    shape: single pixel
    behavior: Does not change
    constraints: "None"

  - color: white (0)
      shape: single pixel
      behavior: "Can be replaced"
      constraints: None

actions:
  - name: add_orange_neighbors
    target: blue pixel
    condition: "The blue pixel must be horizontally and vertically surrounded by at least one white pixel."
    result: "White pixels in the four adjacent (up, down, left, right) positions become orange."

  - name: add_yellow_neighbors
    target: red pixel
    condition: "The red pixel must be horizontally and vertically surrounded by at least one white pixel."
    result: "White pixels in the four adjacent (up, down, left, right) positions become yellow."
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate Key Pixels**: Scan the input grid to identify "key" blue (1) and red (2) pixels. A "key" pixel is one that is at the center of a plus shaped empty space - it must have at least one adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white (0) pixel.
2.  **Expand Around Blue**: For each key blue pixel, change any adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white pixels to orange (7).
3.  **Expand Around Red**: For each key red pixel, change any adjacent (up, down, left, and right) white pixels to yellow (4).
4. **Preserve Magenta:** Copy any magenta (6) pixels from the input to output with no change.
5.  **Unchanged Pixels**: All other pixels remain unchanged in their original color and position.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
