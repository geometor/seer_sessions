Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 9x9 grids containing colored pixels. The colors present in the input are red (2), magenta (6), and blue (1), along with the background white (0). The output introduces new colors: yellow (4) and orange (7). The positions of the original colored pixels seem to be preserved. The new colored pixels appear adjacent to the original ones.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements: pixels
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - red (2)
        - magenta (6)
        - blue (1)
        - yellow (4)
        - orange (7)
      position:
        row: [0-8]
        column: [0-8]
actions:
  - type: add_pixels
    description: New pixels are added adjacent to existing colored pixels.
    properties:
      color_mapping:
        - original: blue (1)
          new: orange (7)
        - original: red(2)
          new: yellow (4)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: New pixels are placed horizontally or vertically adjacent to existing colored pixels.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** existing colored pixels (non-white pixels) in the input grid.
2.  For each colored pixel:
    *   If the colored pixel is blue (1), place orange (7) pixels adjacent to it, both horizontally and vertically. Only place the new orange pixel if the location is empty (white).
    *   If the colored pixel is red (2), place a yellow(4) pixels adjacent, both horizontally and vertically. Only place the new yellow pixel if the location is empty (white).
    *   If a color other than blue(1) or red(2), maintain the original input color.

In short, blue(1) gets an outline of orange(7) and red(2) gets an outline of yellow(4). Magenta (6) is not affected, it is copied to same place.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
