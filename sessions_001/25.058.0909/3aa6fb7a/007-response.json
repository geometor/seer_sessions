The primary colors observed are white (0) and azure (8). In the output, there's an introduction of blue (1) pixels. The overall shape and size of the grid remain constant between input and output. The azure (8) pixels appear to form a somewhat connected shape, and the blue (1) pixels appear within the bounds of this shape, seeming to trace a line segment along pixels that are 8 in the input, but the trace isn't complete (not all the 8s are replaced by 1s).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

This is the core rule of transformation in this task.\n"
