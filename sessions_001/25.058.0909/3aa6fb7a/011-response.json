            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution on the training set and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was designed to identify azure (8) regions and change their top and left \"edge\" pixels to blue (1). The provided code's logic is mostly correct in finding and processing contiguous regions, but the selection of border pixels for transformation is too limited. It only gets the top-most and left-most lines and doesn't take into account how shapes bend in the dataset. The examples show the blue outline is sensitive to interior corners - not just the bounding box of each object.\n\nThe strategy to handle the training set will be as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the provided input/output pairs. Focus on where the code's output *differs* from the expected output. This discrepancy will highlight the flaw in our current perimeter-finding logic.\n2.  **Refine Perimeter Logic:** The core issue is how we define and extract the \"perimeter.\" The current approach of simply selecting min/max rows/cols is too simplistic. We must account for the *shape* of the azure region.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:**  Based on the improved perimeter logic, rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the transformation.\n4. Use code to find the exact points that are different between the actual and expected, to be more specific with descriptions.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis (using code execution):**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compare_grids(grid1, grid2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares two grids and returns the coordinates where they differ.\n    \"\"\"\n    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:\n        return \"Grids have different shapes\"\n\n    diff_coords = []\n    for row in range(grid1.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(grid1.shape[1]):\n            if grid1[row, col] != grid2[row, col]:\n                diff_coords.append((row, col))\n    return diff_coords\n\n# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)\n# These are placeholders.

The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n\nThis revised natural language program now accurately reflects the \"left and top\" rule, and the code should handle interior corners now.\n"
