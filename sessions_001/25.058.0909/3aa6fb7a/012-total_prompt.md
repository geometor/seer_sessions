Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identifies contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
Then, changes a subset of these azure pixels to blue (1) based on a line-tracing rule.
The rule traces the outer perimeter of each azure region, changing azure pixels to blue
if they are part of the outer "edge" of the shape, specifically the top and left edges, creating
an L-shape, with a preference for the longest segment of each edge.
The original grid dimensions and the positions of unchanged pixels are preserved.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution on the training set and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to identify azure (8) regions and change their top and left "edge" pixels to blue (1). The provided code's logic is mostly correct in finding and processing contiguous regions, but the selection of border pixels for transformation is too limited. It only gets the top-most and left-most lines and doesn't take into account how shapes bend in the dataset. The examples show the blue outline is sensitive to interior corners - not just the bounding box of each object.

The strategy to handle the training set will be as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the provided input/output pairs. Focus on where the code's output *differs* from the expected output. This discrepancy will highlight the flaw in our current perimeter-finding logic.
2.  **Refine Perimeter Logic:** The core issue is how we define and extract the "perimeter." The current approach of simply selecting min/max rows/cols is too simplistic. We must account for the *shape* of the azure region.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:**  Based on the improved perimeter logic, rewrite the natural language program to accurately reflect the transformation.
4. Use code to find the exact points that are different between the actual and expected, to be more specific with descriptions.

**Example Metrics and Analysis (using code execution):**

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
    """
    Compares two grids and returns the coordinates where they differ.
    """
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        return "Grids have different shapes"

    diff_coords = []
    for row in range(grid1.shape[0]):
        for col in range(grid1.shape[1]):
            if grid1[row, col] != grid2[row, col]:
                diff_coords.append((row, col))
    return diff_coords

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: azure_region
    color: 8
    property: contiguous
    action: outline

  - name: blue_outline
    color: 1
    property: perimeter
    action: replaces_azure

actions:
  - name: outline
    input: azure_region
    description: >
      Identifies the outer perimeter of each contiguous azure region.  The
      perimeter follows the "left and top" rule. The "left" includes any
      pixel to the right of an interior empty cell.
      The "top" includes any pixel below an interior empty cell.
    output: blue_outline

  - name: replaces_azure
    input: [azure_region, blue_outline]
    description:  Azure pixels on the identified perimeter are changed to blue.
    output: modified_grid
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Perimeter:** For each azure region, trace its outer perimeter.  The perimeter is defined as the set of azure pixels that satisfy *any* of the following:
    * It is on the top-most row of the object
    * It is on the left-most column of the object
    * It has an empty (non-azure) neighbor *directly above* it.
    * It has an empty (non-azure) neighbor *directly to its left*.
3.  **Change Perimeter Color:** Change the color of all identified perimeter pixels from azure (8) to blue (1).
4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (those not part of any azure region's perimeter) retain their original colors. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

This revised natural language program now accurately reflects the "left and top" rule, and the code should handle interior corners now.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
