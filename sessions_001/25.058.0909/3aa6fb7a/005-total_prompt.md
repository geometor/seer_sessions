```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all distinct groups of contiguous azure (8) pixels within the input grid. A distinct group is one that is not connected to another group, either directly or diagonally.
2.  **Identify Border Pixels:** For each azure (8) pixel group, identify its border pixels. A border pixel is an azure pixel that is adjacent (horizontally or vertically, *not* diagonally) to a white (0) pixel.
3.  **Locate Target Pixel:** Within each group, select the *top-leftmost* border pixel. "Top-leftmost" is defined relative to the overall grid coordinates, i.e., the pixel with the smallest row index; and among those with the same row index, the one with the smallest column index.
4.  **Transformation:** Change the color of the selected top-leftmost border pixel in each azure group to blue (1).
5.  **Output:** Create an output grid which is identical to the input grid, except for the transformed pixels.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
