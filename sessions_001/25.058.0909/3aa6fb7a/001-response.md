Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 7x7 grids. The input grid contains azure (8) pixels arranged in two separate groups. The output grid is identical to the input grid, except that some of the azure pixels have been changed to blue (1). The change seems to be specific to individual azure pixels, not entire groups. Specifically a single azure pixel at the border between a group of pixels and background pixels has been changed to blue.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            1: blue
            8: azure

  - type: pixel_group
    properties:
      - color: azure
      - shape: irregular
      - adjacency:
          to: white pixels
      - action: 
          change_color:
              target: border_pixel
              new_color: blue
      - border_pixel:
          defined_as: 
            pixel: 
              with_color: azure 
              adjacent_to:
                pixel: 
                  with_color: white

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all groups of contiguous azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Identify border pixels.** For each group of azure (8) pixels identify border pixels
3.  **Locate Target Pixels:** Find the specific azure pixels that are along the border of the group with white background.
4.  **Transform:** Change the color of one of these border azure (8) pixels in each group to blue (1).
5.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the modified pixel colors, leaving all other pixels unchanged.
