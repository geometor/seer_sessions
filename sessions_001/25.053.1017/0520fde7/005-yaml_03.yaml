facts:
  - observation: |
      The input is a 7x3 grid of pixels with colors white (0), blue (1), and gray (5).
  - observation: |
      The output is a 3x3 grid of pixels with colors white (0) and red (2).
  - observation: |
     The central column, all Gray(5), in the input grid is absent in output grid.
  - observation: |
     Blue pixel in input at 0-indexed position [0,2] changes to Red(2) at 0-indexed position[0,1]
  - observation: |
      Blue pixel in input at 0-indexed position [1,1] changes to Red at 0-indexed position [1,0]
  - observation: |
     Blue pixel in the input at 0-indexed position [2,2] changes to Red at 0-indexed position[2,2]
  - relationship: |
      The output grid's width is less by four. The output grid's height is equal.
  - action: |
    Input is transformed to Output, keeping some structure, while the colors change and the central Gray(5) pixels are removed.
