            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, the assessment, and the updated documentation:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code were on the right track, identifying azure objects and attempting to modify a specific pixel within them. However, the logic for selecting *which* pixel to modify was too simplistic and didn't generalize correctly across all examples. The code selects pixels in either the second or second to last row of the object, and changes the *first* one it finds. The examples show that there can be multiple azure objects, and the transformed pixel is always the *right-most* pixel in the target row.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is to:\n1. Correct the targeting logic - we want the *right most* pixel.\n2. Ensure we're selecting all appropriate azure objects, not just the first one.\n\n**Metrics and Reports - Example Set**\n\nWe will revisit the examples with additional information:\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input:** 2 azure objects,\n    - Top-left: top-left: (1,1), bottom-right: (2, 2)\n    - Bottom-Right: top-left (3,4), bottom-right: (4,5)\n- **Expected Output:** Top-left pixel (1,2) and Bottom-right pixel (4,4) changed from 8 to 1.\n- **Actual Output:** Top-left pixel (1,1) and Bottom-right pixel (4,4) changed from 8 to 1.\n- **Analysis:** selected the correct objects, but incorrect pixel in the first object.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:** 3 azure objects,\n    - Top-Right: top-left: (0,4), bottom-right: (1,5)\n    - Middle-left: top-left: (2,2), bottom-right: (3,3)\n    - Bottom-Center: top-left (5,4), bottom-right: (6,5)\n- **Expected Output:** Top-Right pixel (0,5), Middle-left pixel (2,3), and Bottom-Center pixel (5,4) changed from 8 to 1.\n- **Actual Output:** Top-Right pixel (0,4), Middle-left pixel (2,2), and Bottom-Center pixel (5,3) changed from 8 to 1.\n- **Analysis:** selected the correct objects, but incorrect pixel in all objects.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task_id: \"002\"\n  - example_set: \"train\"\n  - objects:\n      - description: \"Contiguous regions of azure (8) pixels.\"\n        properties:\n          - color: 8  # Azure\n          - shape: \"Irregular, defined by contiguous blocks.\"\n        instances:\n          - example_1:\n            - bounding_box: [1, 1, 2, 2]  # top-left x, top-left y, bottom-right x, bottom-right y\n            - bounding_box: [3, 4, 4, 5]\n            - changed_pixel: [1,2]\n            - changed_to: 1\n            - changed_pixel: [4,4]\n            - changed_to: 1\n          - example_2:\n            - bounding_box: [0, 4, 1, 5]\n            - bounding_box: [2, 2, 3, 3]\n            - bounding_box: [5, 4, 6, 5]\n            - changed_pixel: [0,5]\n            - changed_to: 1\n            - changed_pixel: [2,3]\n            - changed_to: 1\n            - changed_pixel: [5,4]\n            - changed_to: 1\n  - actions:\n    - description: \"Change the color of a specific pixel within each azure object.\"\n      target: \"The right-most pixel in the second row of multi-row objects or the right-most pixel in the second to last row for multi-row objects. Single row objects aren't changed.\"\n      from_color: 8  # Azure\n      to_color: 1  # Blue\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels within the grid. These are the target objects.\n2.  **Iterate:** For each identified azure object:\n    a. **Check Height:** Get the number of rows in the object.\n    b. **Select Row:**\n        * If the object's height is greater than 1, get the second row and the second to last row.\n        * If only one of these rows exist, choose that row.\n    c. **Select Pixel:**\n        * Find all pixels in that row.\n        * Of those, find the pixel that is the furthest right (largest column value).\n    d. **Modify:** Change the color value of this selected pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).\n3.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the modified pixels within each azure object.\n"
