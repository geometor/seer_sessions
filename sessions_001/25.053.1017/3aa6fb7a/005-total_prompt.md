Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels within the grid. These are the target objects.
2.  **Iterate:** For each identified azure object:
    a. **Check Height:** Get the number of rows in the object.
    b. **Select Row:**
        * If the object's height is greater than 1, get the second row and the second to last row.
        * If only one of these rows exist, choose that row.
    c. **Select Pixel:**
        * Find all pixels in that row.
        * Of those, find the pixel that is the furthest right (largest column value).
    d. **Modify:** Change the color value of this selected pixel from azure (8) to blue (1).
3.  **Output:** The output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the modified pixels within each azure object.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
