Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another grid of the same dimensions. The primary element appears to be a recognizable shape formed by connected pixels of the same color (gray '5' in the input) against a background of a different color (white '0'). This shape is then seemingly decomposed into two distinct sub-shapes, each assigned a unique color (red '2' and azure '8'). The decomposition seems to follow the contours of the original shape, splitting it based on connectivity.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: background
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      role: static
  - object: foreground_shape
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      shape: irregular, connected
    actions:
      - decomposed:
        part1:
          color: red (2)
          shape: sub-shape_1
        part2:
          color: azure (8)
          shape: sub-shape_2
  - relationship: foreground_shape within background
  - relationship: sub-shape_1 and sub-shape_2 compose foreground_shape

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Foreground Object:** Locate the contiguous block of pixels that are not the background color (0). In this case, it's the gray (5) shape.
2.  **Decompose the Object:** Divide the foreground object into two distinct sub-objects. The division appears to be based on runs along the rows. The first two '5' pixels encountered on row 2 will be the starting elements of a breadth-first search. Pixels that are adjacent (not diagonal) to these pixels will be included in sub-shape\_1.
3. **Recolor sub-shapes:** sub-shape\_1 receives color red (2).
4.  **Remaining Pixels:** The pixels from the original shape that are not assigned to sub-shape\_1 are assigned to sub-shape\_2.
5. **Recolor sub-shapes:** sub-shape\_2 receives color azure (8).
6.  **Output:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, with the background color (0) everywhere except for the locations of sub-shape\_1 and sub-shape\_2, colored as defined.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
