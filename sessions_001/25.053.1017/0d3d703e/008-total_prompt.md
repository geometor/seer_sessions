# Example

**input:**
```
9 4 2
9 4 2
9 4 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470FC70>

**output:**
```
8 3 6
8 3 6
8 3 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470EAA0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit numbers. Each number corresponds to a specific color (as defined in the system prompt's `COLOR_MAP`). The input grid is transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a consistent mapping of input numbers to output numbers.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - each integer maps to a color

actions:
  - map_values:  Input values are replaced with different output values.

relationships:
  - input_grid:  Corresponds to a specific output_grid.
  - input_value:  Maps to a unique output_value.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by replacing each number with a corresponding new number. The mapping is as follows:

*   9 is replaced by 8.
*   4 is replaced by 3.
*   2 is replaced by 6.

The structure of the grid (3x3) and relative position of the pixels are preserved; only the values of the pixels change according to this mapping.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
