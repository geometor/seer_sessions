# Example

**input:**
```
5 8 6
5 8 6
5 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470FC70>

**output:**
```
1 9 2
1 9 2
1 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x75C2E470EBF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers.  Each number in the input grid corresponds to a specific color (as defined by the `COLOR_MAP`). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, but the numbers, and thus the colors, are different.  The transformation appears to be a consistent mapping of input numbers to output numbers.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_type: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 3x3 grid
  elements: integers (0-9)
  representation: color-coded pixels
output:
  type: 3x3 grid
  elements: integers (0-9)
  representation: color-coded pixels
transformation:
  type: number_mapping
  details: Each input number is consistently mapped to a different output number.
objects:
    - name: input_grid
    - name: output_grid
    - properties:
      - grid
      - color
      - number
relationships:
  - input grid maps to output_grid
  - numbers map to other numbers
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed into the output grid by applying a fixed substitution rule to each number. The rule based on this example is:

1.  Replace the number 5 with the number 1.
2.  Replace the number 8 with the number 9.
3.  Replace the number 6 with the number 2.

This rule is applied to every cell in the input grid to produce the corresponding cell in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
