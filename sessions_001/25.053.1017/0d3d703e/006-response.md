The input grid is transformed into the output grid by applying a fixed substitution rule to each number. The rule is:

1.  Replace the number 5 with the number 1.
2.  Replace the number 8 with the number 9.
3.  Replace the number 6 with the number 2.

This rule is applied to every cell in the input grid to produce the corresponding cell in the output grid.
