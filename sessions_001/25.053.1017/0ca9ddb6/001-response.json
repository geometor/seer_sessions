The input grid contains a red pixel (2) and a blue pixel (1), while the output grid introduces yellow (4) and orange (7) pixels in specific patterns around the original colored pixels. The background is white (0) and remains unchanged. The key seems to be the spatial relationship between the newly introduced colors and the original colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
