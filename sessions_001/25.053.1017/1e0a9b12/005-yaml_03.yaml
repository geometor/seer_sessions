objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 5x5
      cells: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color: integer (0-9)
      position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: move
    properties:
      source: (row, column)
      destination: (row, column)
    conditions:
      - color of source pixel is not 0

  - type: change_color
    properties:
      target: (row, column)
      new_color: integer
    conditions:
      - specific to the transformation logic (to be determined)
      
relationships:
  - spatial: pixels are arranged in a grid, adjacency matters.
  - conditional: movement and color changes depend on certain conditions.
