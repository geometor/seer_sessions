            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program correctly identified the column duplication pattern. However, a complete and thorough analysis requires checking *all* examples to ensure the rule is universally applicable within the training set. The provided information doesn't explicitly state whether the code passed or failed on other examples. We need to assume it might have failed and prepare to revise. My strategy is to:\n\n1.  **Verify all examples:** Execute the code on *each* training input and compare the output with the expected output.  I will record success/failure.\n2.  **Identify discrepancies:** If failures occur, pinpoint the exact differences between the produced output and the expected output. This will involve examining the grids visually (through code execution, since I can't \"see\" them directly).\n3.  **Refine the program:** Based on the discrepancies, I'll adjust the natural language program to accurately capture the transformation rule that applies to *all* training examples.\n4. **Document the context:** Develop a YAML block of relevant information about the task, the objects, and transformations.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Results (using code execution):**\n\nI need to see the actual input/output grids and the results of the `transform` function. I will add print statements within a wrapped version of the provided code to accomplish this and run this combined code.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n
