## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 6 6
1 6 1
8 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D4070>

**output:**
```
6 6 6 6 6 6
1 6 1 1 6 1
8 8 6 6 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D65C0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The primary change appears to be a horizontal expansion or duplication of the original grid. The dimensions of the grid change from 3x3 to 3x6, with the width doubling. It is likely that the input file size information isn't needed for the model, but the images do help clarify the meaning of the integer numbers.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D arrays of integers representing colors.
  - property: color
    values: {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 5: gray, 6: magenta, 7: orange, 8: azure, 9: maroon}
    description: Each integer corresponds to a specific color.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - data_type: integer
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x6
      - data_type: integer
  - relationship: transformation
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
    type: horizontal_duplication
    details: Each column in the input grid is duplicated once, resulting in a doubled width.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** Receive a 3x3 grid of integers, where each integer represents a color.
2.  **Process:** For each column in the input grid, duplicate that column immediately to its right.
3.  **Output:** Produce a 3x6 grid, where each original column from the input is now present twice in sequence. This effectively doubles the width of the grid while maintaining the original height.

Essentially, every column gets duplicated, and the newly duplicated column is put right next to the original.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
