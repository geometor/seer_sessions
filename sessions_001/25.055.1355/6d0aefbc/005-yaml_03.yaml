  The task involves transforming an input grid into an output grid by duplicating each column of the input. The height of the grid remains the same, while the width is doubled.

objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: variable
      - width: variable
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: Output Grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: same as Input Grid
      - width: twice the width of Input Grid
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

  - name: Column
    type: 1D array (sub-component of Grid)
    properties:
      - elements: integers (0-9 representing colors)

actions:
  - name: Duplicate Column
    input: Column
    output: Two identical, adjacent Columns
    description:  A column from the Input Grid is copied, and both the original and the copy are placed side-by-side in the Output Grid.
