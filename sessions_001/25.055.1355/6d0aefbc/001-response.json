The colors are represented by single-digit integers. The primary change appears to be a horizontal expansion or duplication of the original grid. The dimensions of the grid change from 3x3 to 3x6, with the width doubling. It is likely that the input file size information isn't needed for the model, but the images do help clarify the meaning of the integer numbers.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

This effectively doubles the width of the grid while maintaining the original height.\n\nEssentially, every column gets duplicated, and the newly duplicated column is put right next to the original.\n"
