The input grid appears to be smaller (3x3) than the output grid (3x6). The colors in the input grid seem to be replicated and rearranged in the output grid. There's a clear expansion of the original pattern. The core concept seems to be mirroring or reflection, likely along a vertical axis. The shape changes from a square to a horizontal rectangle.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

The original input will form columns 1, 2, and 3. The mirror image of those columns will form columns 4, 5, and 6. Specifically do the following:\n    *  Column 4 of output becomes a copy of Column 3 of input\n    *  Column 5 of output becomes a copy of Column 2 of input\n    *  Column 6 of output becomes a copy of column 1 of input\n3. **Combine:** The output grid is the combination of the original input grid and its reflected copy, side-by-side. The output will be a 3 x 6 grid.\n\nEssentially, the input grid is duplicated and mirrored horizontally to form the output grid.\n"
