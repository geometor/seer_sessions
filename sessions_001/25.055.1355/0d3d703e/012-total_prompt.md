"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid by adding 4 to the value of each pixel.

    Args:
        input_grid: A 2D numpy array representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A 2D numpy array representing the transformed output grid.
    """
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate over each cell in the grid
    for row_index in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        for col_index in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
            # change output pixels by adding 4
            output_grid[row_index, col_index] = output_grid[row_index, col_index] + 4

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too simplistic. It assumed a constant addition of 4 to each pixel's value. The provided training examples demonstrate this isn't universally true. Some pixels change according to the rule +4 mod 10 and other pixels are unchanged. We need to identify the conditions under which the transformation (+4 mod 10) is applied and when it isn't.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output grids for each example. Identify the pixels where the expected and actual outputs differ.
2.  **Look for Patterns:** Determine if there's a pattern in the locations or values of the mismatched pixels. Consider spatial relationships (adjacency, position), original pixel values, and any other relevant features.
3.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Based on the patterns observed, revise the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation rule, including the conditions for applying the +4 operation. It is very likely it is +4 mod 10, not just +4.
4.  **YAML Documentation:** Create a detailed YAML document describing the observations.
5.  **Iterate:** if the next run still has issues, we will look for the more complex rule.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To help analyze I'll use `code_execution` to prepare details about each training example, showing the differences.

```python
import numpy as np

    """

    Also prints these values.

        expected_grid: The expected output grid.
        actual_grid: The actual output grid produced by the transform function.

    Returns:

**Observations and Insights from Code Execution:**

*   **Example 1:** The original code *happens* to work, only because all of the pixels that change happen to be 5 and 5 + 4 = 9.
*   **Example 2:** The +4 rule works for the pixel with value 5 (becoming 9) but not for the pixels with value 8, which need to become 2. If we consider the correct operation is +4 mod 10, we would have 8 + 4 = 12, and 12 mod 10 = 2 - a match.
*    **Example 3:** The +4 rule does not directly apply. Pixels with 6 are supposed to change to 0. If we consider +4 mod 10, we get 6 + 4 = 10, and 10 mod 10 = 0.

**Conclusion:** The transformation rule appears to selectively apply +4 mod 10 to *some* pixel values, while leaving others unchanged. The pixels with value 1 are not changed.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  If the pixel's value is 5, 6, or 8 change the pixel's value by adding 4 and taking the modulus of 10.
3.  Otherwise, leave the pixel's value unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
