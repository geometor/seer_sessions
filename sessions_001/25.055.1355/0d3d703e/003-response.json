            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a revised natural language program and supporting documentation.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was too simplistic. It performed a basic element-wise increment, which worked for the first example but failed on subsequent ones. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't simply incrementing every pixel's value. There's a conditional or contextual element that the original program missed, most likely having to do with the color or the value. The mention of modulo in the failed test cases strongly suggests a wrap-around effect, where values exceeding a certain limit (likely 9) reset to 0 or another base value. Modulo is implicit in the task's color scheme, since the values are integers from 0-9.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Failed Cases:** Carefully examine the input and output grids of the failed examples to pinpoint the exact conditions under which the increment *doesn't* happen or happens differently.\n2.  **Identify the Rule:** Determine the precise rule governing the transformation. This will likely involve a conditional statement (if-then-else) based on the pixel value.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the observed rule.\n4.  **Update YAML and code:** Generate an improved YAML documentation and python function, and re-test on *all* training examples.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nI will go through each input/output pair to observe differences. Note I don't have the ability to execute code at this stage, but will use my analysis.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`\n    *   Output: `[[2, 3], [4, 5]]`\n    *   Result: `[[2, 3], [4, 5]]`\n    *   `Correct: True`\n    *   Observation: All values incremented by 1.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[5, 6], [7, 8]]`\n    *   Output: `[[6, 7], [8, 9]]`\n    *   Result: `[[6, 7], [8, 9]]`\n    *   `Correct: True`\n    *    Observation: All values are incremented by 1.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[9, 1], [2, 9]]`\n    *   Output: `[[0, 2], [3, 0]]`\n    *   Result: `[[10, 2], [3, 10]]`\n    *   `Correct: False`\n    *   Observation: Values of 9 become 0, other values are incremented by one. This indicates a modulo operation.\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n\n    *    Input: `[[0, 4, 9], [9, 2, 1]]`\n    *    Output: `[[1, 5, 0], [0, 3, 2]]`\n    *    Result: `[[1, 5, 10], [10, 3, 2]]`\n    *    `Correct: False`\n    *    Observation:  9 becomes 0. The rest are incremented. Confirms modulo.\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      - cells: individual pixels with integer values 0-9\n      - dimensions: variable, between 1x1 and 30x30\n    actions:\n      - name: increment_with_modulo\n        description: Each pixel's value is incremented by 1. If the original value is 9, the new value is 0.\n        parameters:\n          - input_grid: 2D array of integers\n        result:\n          - output_grid: 2D array of integers with each value incremented (modulo 10)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n\"The output grid is derived from the input grid by incrementing the value of each pixel by 1. If a pixel's value is 9, it is changed to 0 in the output grid. In other words, each value has 1 added, modulo 10.\"\n"
