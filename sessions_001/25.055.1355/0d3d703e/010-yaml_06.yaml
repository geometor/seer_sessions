facts:
  - observation: |
      Each example shows a grid transformation where some pixel values change, and some remain the same.
  - object_identification: |
      The grids can be seen as collections of pixels, or as regions of contiguous pixels of the same color.
  - transformation_type: |
      The transformation is a color replacement, but it's not a simple arithmetic operation.
  - example_1:
      color_mapping: {5: 9, 1: 1}
      border_effect: false
  - example_2:
      color_mapping: {1: 1, 8: 2, 5: 9}
      border_effect: false
  - example_3:
      color_mapping: {6: 0, 8: 2}
      border_effect: false
