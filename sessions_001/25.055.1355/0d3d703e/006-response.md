"""
The transformation rule between the input and output grids involves a simple arithmetic operation on each pixel. Specifically, each pixel's value in the input grid is incremented by 1 to obtain the corresponding pixel's value in the output grid. Because the pixel values must stay within the range of 0-9, inclusive, a modulo 10 operation is applied. This means that if a pixel's value is 9, adding 1 results in 10, and the modulo 10 operation changes the value to 0. The dimensions (height and width) of the input and output grids are always identical. The grids can have different shapes.
