## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B80D0>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B8610>
Okay, here's a report on my perception of the task, including a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains single-digit integers (2, 3, and 8), and the output grid contains single-digit integers (6, 4, and 9). The transformation appears to be a simple numerical operation applied to each corresponding cell in the input and output grids. The spatial arrangement of the cells seems irrelevant, as each cell is transformed independently. The colors represent the digits, and there are three distinct "objects" or pixel types because of the three input digits.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: integer (0-9)
      color: corresponds to value per COLOR_MAP
      position: (row, column) in grid
    possible_values: [2, 3, 8]  # For input
    transformed_values: [6, 4, 9] # For output

grid:
  - properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels

actions:
 - type: transformation
   description: Changes the value of each pixel based on a consistent rule
   input: pixel value from the input grid
   output: pixel value in the output grid

relationships:
  - type: one-to-one correspondence
    description: Each pixel in the input grid maps directly to a corresponding pixel in the output grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** We have a 3x3 input grid and a 3x3 output grid.
2.  **Iteration:** For each pixel in the input grid, at position (row, column):
    *   Get the pixel's integer value.
    *   Apply transformation defined as input value + 4 to get the output value.
    *   Place the new value in the output grid at the same (row, column).
3.  **Termination:** The output grid is complete.

Essentially the program performs the operation of *input pixel value + 4 = output pixel value*.
Since the digits represent colors, this same description can be phrased as a color transformation of *red + 4 = magenta*, *green + 4 = yellow*, and *azure + 4 = maroon*.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
