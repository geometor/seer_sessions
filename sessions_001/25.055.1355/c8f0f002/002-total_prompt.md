## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 8 8 7 7 8
1 1 7 7 1 8
7 1 1 7 7 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA6E0>

**output:**
```
1 8 8 5 5 8
1 1 5 5 1 8
5 1 1 5 5 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7DCBFF213340>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation appears to involve a change in color of specific elements within the grid. The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The most obvious change is that all 7s (orange) in the input become 5s (gray) in the output. Other digits remain unchanged.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: |
      Each cell in the grid contains a single-digit integer representing a color.
  - observation: |
      The integers correspond to colors as per a predefined mapping.
  - observation: |
      Only digits with initial value 7 become 5 in output
  - observation: |
      all other values remain unchanged
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x6
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)
    relationships:
      - "contains: cells"
  - object: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color: derived from value (COLOR_MAP)
    actions:
      - change_value: |
         if value is 7, change to 5
         otherwise remain same

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  **Check** the value of the cell.
3.  **If** the value is 7, **change** it to 5.
4.  **Otherwise**, keep the original value.
5.  **Place** new value to output at same cell location.
6.  Construct the output grid using the transformed cell values.

Essentially the transformation rule is this: Replace all occurrences of the digit 7 with the digit 5, preserving the grid structure and all other digit values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
