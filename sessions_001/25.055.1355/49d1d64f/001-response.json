The input grid consists of four distinct colored pixels, each represented by a unique digit (1, 2, 3, and 8). The output grid appears to be an expansion of the input grid, where each original pixel is replicated in a 2x2 block within the larger grid.  The colors/digits are preserved in this expansion. Additionally, the output grid has cells that aren't part of the 2x2 blocks, they are at the top row, and leftmost and rightmost columns. These cells are colored white (represented by 0).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

Specifically, if the input pixel is at `(row, col)`, the 2x2 block in the output grid will start at `(row*2 + 1, col*2 + 1)` and fill cells `(row*2 + 1, col*2 + 1)`, `(row*2 + 1, col*2 + 2)`, `(row*2 + 2, col*2 + 1)`, and `(row*2 + 2, col*2 + 2)`.\n\n3. **Fill Borders**:\n    * set the value of cells in the first row to 0\n    * set the value of cells in the last row to 0\n    * set the value of cells in the first column to 0\n    * set the value of cells in the last column to 0\n\nEssentially, the program doubles the input grid, placing the expanded pixels in the \"inner\" 2x2 squares, starting the placement from the second row and second column, leaving the first and last row and first and last column to be filled by 0.\n"
