facts:
  - observation: Each input pixel appears to be transformed into a region in the output.
  - observation: The output dimensions are not always double the input dimensions.
  - observation: Example 3 suggests a 3x3 output for a 1x1 input.
  - observation: Example 1 and 2 show that a 2x2 block can become a specific padded region.
  - object: Input pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
      - location: (row, column)
    transformation:
      - expanded: True
      - rule: Becomes a 2x2 or padded section in the output.
  - object: Output region
    properties:
      - dimensions: Variable, dependent on input.
      - padding: appears to use 0 (white)
