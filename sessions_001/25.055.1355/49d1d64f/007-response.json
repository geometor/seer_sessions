The input grid appears to be embedded within the output grid, and the output grid seems to be an expanded version of the input, with added padding and duplication of some elements. The colors (represented by numbers) in the input grid are preserved in the output grid. There's a clear geometric relationship between the input and output. The background or padding color appears to be 0 (white).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
