# Hypothetical code_execution results - Example 1 (Correct)

# Input: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# Expected Output: [[1, 2, 3, 0, 1], [4, 5, 6, 0, 4], [7, 8, 9, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 4, 7, 0, 1]]
# Actual Output: [[1, 2, 3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 6, 5, 4], [7, 8, 9, 8, 7], [4, 5, 6, 5, 4], [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]]

# Metrics:
#   - Input Shape: (3, 3)
#   - Output Shape (Expected): (5, 5)
#   - Output Shape (Actual): (5, 5)
#   - Correct Pixels: Some, including mirroring of content but zero padding is missing
#   - Incorrect Pixels: All the padding cells.

# Hypothetical code_execution results - Example 2 (Incorrect)

# Input: [[6, 6, 6], [6, 8, 6], [6, 6, 6]]
# Expected Output: [[6, 6, 6], [6, 8, 6], [6, 6, 6]]
# Actual Output: [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [6, 8, 6, 8, 6], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]

# Metrics:
#   - Input Shape: (3, 3)
#   - Output Shape (Expected): (3, 3)
#   - Output Shape (Actual): (5, 5)
#   - Correct Pixels: 9
#   - Incorrect Pixels: 16

# Hypothetical code_execution results - Example 3 (Incorrect)

# Input: [[5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]
# Expected Output: [[5]]
# Actual Output: [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]
# Metrics:
#   - Input Shape: (3, 3)
#   - Output Shape (Expected): (1, 1)
#   - Output Shape (Actual): (5, 5)
#   - Correct Pixels: Some are correct (the mirrored 5s), but location and output size is wrong.
#   - Incorrect Pixels: Many

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
