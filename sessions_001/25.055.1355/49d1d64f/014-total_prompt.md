## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 1 4
8 0 2
3 2 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF213340>

**output:**
```
0 2 1 4 0
2 2 1 4 4
8 8 0 2 2
3 3 2 8 8
0 3 2 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7DCBFF1118D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a smaller grid (3x3) into a larger grid (5x5). The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or replication of the original grid's elements. The colors (represented by digits) in the input grid seem to be preserved and repositioned in the output grid. There's a clear geometric relationship, but it's not a simple scaling. The central element of the input (0, white) appears to be somewhat "centered" within the output, and the other elements fan out, almost like a "mirrored cross" of the original. The additional 0s seem to "fill in" areas with no mirrored counterpart.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: grid_transformation
input:
  type: 2D_grid
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  properties:
    - object: individual cells
      attributes:
        color: integer_value
        position: (row, column)
output:
  type: 2D_grid
  dimensions: 5x5
  elements: integers (0-9, representing colors)
  properties:
    - object: individual cells
      attributes:
        color: integer_value
        position: (row, column)
transformation:
  type: expansion_with_mirroring_and_padding
  padding_color: 0 # white
  actions:
       - mirror input grid horizontally
       - mirror input grid vertically
       - pad: fill remaining cells with 0

relationships:
  - input cell (i, j) maps to multiple output cells, including (i+1, j+1)
  - mirroring creates symmetrical placements of colors around center cell.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Center Preservation:** The center element (1,1) of the input grid is placed at the center (2,2) of the output grid.
2.  **Horizontal and Vertical Mirroring:** Copy each cell from input to output. Each non-center cell is mirrored, copying the color/value:
    *   Horizontally across the central vertical axis.
    *   Vertically across the central horizontal axis.
    *    Across both center axes, copying diagonally
3. **Padding with '0'**: Any remaining empty cells in the output grid that were not filled during the mirroring process are filled with the value '0' (white).

In essence, the transformation takes the input grid, expands it by creating mirrored copies around a central vertical and horizontal axis, and fills in any leftover space with zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
