Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is: white (0) pixels in the input grid shift down by one row, wrapping around from the bottom row to the top. Maroon (9) pixels remain in their original positions. Other color pixels are unaffected by the white pixel movement.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the rule: white pixels shift down one row, wrapping around.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the input grid
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Apply transformation based on current pixel above
            if r == 0:
                above = input_grid[rows-1,c]
            else:
                above = input_grid[r-1,c]

            if above == 0:
                output_grid[r,c] = 0
            elif input_grid[r, c] == 0:
                output_grid[r,c] = above



    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan for improvement:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, capturing the basic idea of a downward shift of white pixels. However, it fails to correctly handle cases where the downward shift of a white pixel should overwrite a non-white, non-maroon pixel. The current logic incorrectly preserves the original pixel's color in those situations. The core issue is that the code considers what color should go *into* a space, instead of determining what color should *move out of* a space.

The strategy for improvement involves reframing the logic. Instead of thinking about what value should occupy a cell based on the cell above, we should focus on identifying *where each white pixel will move to*. This requires a shift in perspective from "filling in" the output grid to "relocating" the white pixels within a copy of the input grid.

**Example Metrics and Results:**

To accurately describe what is happening it is important to build a report of each example.

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def describe_grid(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    description = {
        'dimensions': f'{rows}x{cols}',
        'counts': {}
    }
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    for color, count in zip(unique, counts):
        description['counts'][int(color)] = int(count)  # Convert to native int
    return description

def analyze_example(example):

    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    predicted_grid = transform(input_grid)  # Assuming 'transform' is defined
    correct = np.array_equal(output_grid, predicted_grid)

        'input': describe_grid(input_grid),
        'output': describe_grid(output_grid),

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
