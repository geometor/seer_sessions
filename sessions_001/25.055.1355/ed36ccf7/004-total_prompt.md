Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is: white (0) pixels in the input grid shift down by one row, wrapping around from the bottom row to the top. Maroon (9) pixels remain in their original positions.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the rule: white pixels shift down one row, wrapping around.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through the input grid to find white pixels
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] == 0:
                # Calculate the new row index, wrapping around
                new_r = (r + 1) % rows
                # Shift the white pixel down
                output_grid[r, c] = 9  # original spot becomes maroon
                output_grid[new_r, c] = 0 # new location

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of applying the initial transformation rule to the training examples and refine our understanding of the task.

**General Assessment:**

The initial rule, "white (0) pixels shift down by one row, wrapping around, while maroon (9) pixels remain in their original positions," was partially correct. It correctly identified the movement of white pixels and the stationary nature of maroon pixels. However, the implementation had a flaw: it incorrectly set the original location of a moved white pixel to maroon (9) when it did a swap with the current pixel in the next row. The training set feedback clearly demonstrates cases where this swap process does not occur. Therefore, a revised strategy is needed to reflect the independent nature of the white pixels.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Correct the Swapping Error:** The primary issue is the incorrect assumption that white pixels *swap* with whatever is below. We need to treat the movement of each white pixel as a discrete action. A white cell needs to change to the value of the cell above it, the value of the top cell, if on the bottom row.
2.  **Re-examine Edge Cases:** Carefully consider what happens at the boundaries (top and bottom rows) to ensure the wrapping behavior is accurately captured.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_results(examples, results):
    analysis = []
    for i, (example, result) in enumerate(zip(examples, results)):
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        actual_output_grid = np.array(result)

        correct = np.array_equal(expected_output_grid, actual_output_grid)
        
        white_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 0)
        maroon_pixels_input = np.sum(input_grid == 9)
        
        white_pixels_expected = np.sum(expected_output_grid == 0)
        maroon_pixels_expected = np.sum(expected_output_grid == 9)
        
        white_pixels_actual = np.sum(actual_output_grid == 0)
        maroon_pixels_actual = np.sum(actual_output_grid == 9)

        analysis.append({
            'example_index': i,
            'correct': correct,
            'input_grid_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'white_pixels_input': int(white_pixels_input),
            'maroon_pixels_input': int(maroon_pixels_input),
            'white_pixels_expected': int(white_pixels_expected),
            'maroon_pixels_expected': int(maroon_pixels_expected),
            'white_pixels_actual': int(white_pixels_actual),
            'maroon_pixels_actual': int(maroon_pixels_actual),
        })

    return analysis

# get these from the environment
examples = task_data['train']
results = transform_results

analysis = analyze_results(examples, results)
print(analysis)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
