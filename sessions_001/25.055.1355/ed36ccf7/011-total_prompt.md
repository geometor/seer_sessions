Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Identify Object:** Find the contiguous block of magenta (color 6) pixels. This constitutes the primary object.
2.  **Identify Context:** Consider the 3x3 grid. The magenta object is always, in these training example, surrounded by white.
3.  **Rotate Object:** The magenta pixel moves one position counter-clockwise around the perimeter of the 3x3 grid. The previously occupied space become white (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
