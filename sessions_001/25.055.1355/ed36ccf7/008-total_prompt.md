## Example 2

**input:**
```
6 6 6
0 0 0
6 6 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D7310>

**output:**
```
6 0 0
6 0 6
6 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D48E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of pixels. Each pixel has a color value, represented by a single digit integer. The input grid appears to be transformed into the output grid based on a specific rule related to the position and color of the pixels. The colors involved are magenta (6) and white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - name: color
        values: [0, 6] # white, magenta
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - name: row
        type: integer
      - name: column
        type: integer
      - name: color
        type: integer

actions:
  - name: transform_pixel_color
    description: Changes the color of a pixel based on its original color and position.

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: Pixels are arranged in a grid structure, with defined row and column positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** if the pixel's color is magenta (6).
3.  **If** the pixel is magenta (6):
    *   **If** it is the top-left pixel (row 1, column 1) remain.
    * **If** it is on the top row, set the color to white (0).
    * **If** on the bottom row, and is the right-most pixel, set the color to magenta(6)
    * **Otherwise** remain.

    4.  **Check** if the pixel's color is white (0).
    5. **If** on the first row, the last two pixels should be white (0)

In essence, the transformation rotates a block one step counter clockwise.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
