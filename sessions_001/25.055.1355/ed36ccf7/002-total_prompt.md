## Example 1

**input:**
```
9 0 0
9 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC23BA90>

**output:**
```
0 9 9
0 9 9
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC23BD60>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains maroon (9) and white (0) pixels.  The output grid also contains maroon and white pixels, but their positions have changed. The most obvious change is a shift in the position of the white pixels. It appears the transformation involves some form of movement or rearrangement of existing pixels, rather than introducing new colors or complex calculations.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 3x3 matrix of pixels
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [maroon, white]
  - object: pixel
    description: Individual cell within the grid
    properties:
      - color:
          type: integer
          values: [0, 9] # 0=white, 9=maroon
  - action: move
    description: Pixels change their position within the grid.
    details: >
        Specifically, the white pixels appear to shift.
  - relationship: input_output
    description: The input grid transforms into the output grid.
    transformation: pixel_movement
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all white (0) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Shift** the identified white pixels down by one row. If a white pixel in input is in row index `r`, and column index `c`, the new location will be row `r+1` and column `c`.
3.  If a pixel is at the bottom row before a move, it moves to the top row and is inserted at the same column. So, for a white pixel in input at row index 2 (the bottom row), and column index `c`, after the transformation, it will be at row index 0, and column index `c`.
4.  All other pixels (maroon (9)) remain in their original positions. *or*, are shifted as needed to fill the remaining spaces in the grid.

Essentially, the white pixels "cycle" downwards, wrapping from the bottom row to the top. The maroon pixels stay in place, or passively fill the empty spaces.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
