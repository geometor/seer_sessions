The input grid appears to be smaller (3x3) than the output grid (3x6).  The most prominent feature is the presence of a single orange pixel (value 7) in the input, which seems to be duplicated and repositioned in the output. The background is all white pixels (value 0). The dimensions change, and object '7' is duplicated.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
