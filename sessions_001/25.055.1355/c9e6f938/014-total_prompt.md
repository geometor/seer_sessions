## Example 3

**input:**
```
0 0 0
7 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF213340>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0
7 0 0 0 0 7
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CB820>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of numerical values (representing colors) to another grid. The input grid appears to be smaller (3x3) than the output grid (3x6).  The most prominent feature is the presence of a single orange pixel (value 7) in the input, which seems to be duplicated and repositioned in the output. The background is all white pixels (value 0). The dimensions change, and object '7' is duplicated.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        location: [1, 0] # row, col

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x6
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        locations: [[1, 0], [1, 5]] # row, col

  - action: duplication
    target: orange pixel (7)

  - action: repositioning
    target: orange pixel (7)
    details: "Original position is [1,0]. New positions are [1,0] and [1,5]"
  - action: dimension_change
    details: input width is doubled, height is preserved

  - relationship: input to output
    type: transformation
    rule: "Duplicate the orange pixel and place one at the original x,y and one copy on the far right side of output, same row"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find the single orange pixel (value 7) within the input grid. Note its row and column position.
2.  **Double Width:** Create a new output grid with double of input grid, but keep same height.
3.  **Duplicate and Reposition:** Place a copy of the orange pixel at its original location in the new grid.
4.  **Place second object:** Place an additional copy of the orange pixel at the far right side of the new grid, on the same row.
5.  **Fill Background:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with white pixels (value 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
