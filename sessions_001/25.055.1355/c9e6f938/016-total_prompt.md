Previous Code:
```python
"""
Duplicate the orange pixel and place one at the original x,y and one copy on the far right side of output, same row.
"""

import numpy as np

def find_orange_pixel(grid):
    # Find the coordinates of the orange pixel (value 7).
    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[r,c] == 7:
                return (r, c)
    return None  # Should not happen in this specific task, but good practice.


def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid with double the width of the input_grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros((input_grid.shape[0], input_grid.shape[1] * 2), dtype=int)

    # Find the orange pixel in the input grid.
    orange_pixel_coords = find_orange_pixel(input_grid)

    if orange_pixel_coords:
      # Place the original orange pixel.
      output_grid[orange_pixel_coords[0], orange_pixel_coords[1]] = 7
      # Place the duplicated orange pixel on the right edge.
      output_grid[orange_pixel_coords[0], output_grid.shape[1] - 1] = 7

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and refine our understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the assumption that the output grid's width is double that of the input grid, and that an orange pixel from the input is duplicated at the original location and the far right edge of the output. The provided examples show that this assumption is incorrect. The output grid's dimensions seem related, but not simply a doubling. The placement of the orange pixel is also not on the right edge. The duplicated orange pixels locations appear related to the position of original.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Gather Metrics:** For each example, I'll record:
    *   Input grid dimensions.
    *   Output grid dimensions.
    *   Location of the orange pixel in the input.
    *   Locations of the orange pixels in the output.
    * differences in height and width between input and output

2.  **Analyze Metrics:** I'll look for relationships between these metrics to determine:
    *   How the output grid dimensions are calculated.
    *   How the positions of the output orange pixels are determined relative to the input orange pixel.

3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, I'll update the program description to reflect the observed rules accurately.
4. **Refine Facts YAML**: Create a yaml file describing the facts.

**Code Execution for Metrics Gathering**

I need to use the provided `code_execution` tool to extract the necessary metrics from the `task` object.

```tool_code
task_data = []
for example in task["train"]:
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    orange_input = find_orange_pixel(input_grid)
    orange_output = []
    for r in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
      for c in range(output_grid.shape[1]):
        if output_grid[r,c] == 7:
          orange_output.append((r, c))
    
    task_data.append({
        'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
        'output_shape': output_grid.shape,
        'orange_input': orange_input,
        'orange_output': orange_output,
        'width_diff': output_grid.shape[1] - input_grid.shape[1],
        'height_diff': output_grid.shape[0] - input_grid.shape[0]

    })

print(task_data)
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
