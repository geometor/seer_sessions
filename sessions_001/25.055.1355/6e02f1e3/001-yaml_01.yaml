facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 2 (red) and 3 (green).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 5 (gray) and 0 (white).
  - object: Input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [2, 3]
  - object: Output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [5, 0]
  - relation: The center pixel of the input grid (value 2) corresponds to the center pixel of output (value 5).
  - relation: The diagonal from top-left to bottom-right in input [2,2,3] becomes [5,5,5] in output.
  - relation: values of 2 in input correspond to 5 in output.
  - relation: values of 3 in input correspond to 0 in output.
