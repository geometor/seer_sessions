## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 2 2
3 2 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>

**output:**
```
5 0 0
0 5 0
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D6770>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains red (2) and green (3) pixels. The output grid contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels. The transformation seems to involve a change in color and potentially a diagonal pattern.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 2 (red) and 3 (green).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 5 (gray) and 0 (white).
  - object: Input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [2, 3]
  - object: Output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [5, 0]
  - relation: The center pixel of the input grid (value 2) corresponds to the center pixel of output (value 5).
  - relation: The diagonal from top-left to bottom-right in input [2,2,3] becomes [5,5,5] in output.
  - relation: values of 2 in input correspond to 5 in output.
  - relation: values of 3 in input correspond to 0 in output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   If a pixel in the input grid has a value of 2 (red), change it to 5 (gray) in the output grid.
    *   If a pixel in the input grid has a value of 3 (green), change it to 0 (white) in the output grid.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.

Essentially, the transformation is a direct color substitution: red becomes gray, and green becomes white. The spatial arrangement (3x3 grid) remains constant.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
