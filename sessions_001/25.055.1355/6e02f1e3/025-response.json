The input grid contains two distinct colors (yellow and green, represented by 4 and 3, respectively). The output grid uses gray and white (5 and 0) where gray seems to replace one instance of each of the input colors, located diagonally. The consistent size of the grids (3x3) suggests this might be a constraint or inherent to the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this case, yellow (4) and green (3).\n2. **Locate Diagonal:** Imagine/draw a diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the input grid.\n3.  **Replace with Gray:** For each of the colors identified, replace the color on the diagonal line with Gray (5).\n4.  **Other pixels to white:** Fill any other position in the grid with white (0)\n\nEssentially, the rule seems to be a combination of color and position: for all colors on the diagonal, change to gray, otherwise, make the pixels white.\n"
