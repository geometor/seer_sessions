The input grid is composed entirely of yellow pixels (represented by the number 4). The output grid has the top row changed to gray pixels (represented by the number 5), and the remaining two rows changed to white pixels (represented by the number 0). The dimensions of the grid (3x3) remain constant.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
