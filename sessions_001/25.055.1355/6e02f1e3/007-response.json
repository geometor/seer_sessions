The input grid contains pixels of various colors (represented by digits), while the output grid seems to predominantly feature white (0) and gray (5) pixels. The positions of non-white/gray pixels in the output seem to correlate with specific color arrangements in the input. It appears that the transformation might involve replacing certain colors with either white or gray based on their original position or their relationship with neighboring pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
