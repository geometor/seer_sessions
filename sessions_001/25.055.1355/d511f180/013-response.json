Each pixel has a single digit value (0-9) representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement or swapping of colors between specific positions within the grid. The core concept relates to objectness where colors at specific co-ordinates swap each other, numbers and counting as well as basic geometry (grid), are relevant priors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
