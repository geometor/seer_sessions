Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a -90 degree rotation of the input grid. This is achieved by first inverting the order of the rows and then transposing the grid (swapping rows and columns).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by rotating it -90 degrees.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.

    Returns:
        list of lists: The transformed grid.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # 1. Invert Rows: Reverse the order of rows.
    inverted_array = np.flipud(input_array)

    # 2. Transpose: Swap rows and columns.
    output_array = inverted_array.transpose()

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
