Okay, here's a breakdown of the task, the results of the provided code, and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis (rotate -90 degrees, which is equivalent to flipping vertically and then transposing) works for all examples. It correctly identifies the core transformation. The provided code implements this transformation and compares the actual output against the expected output, highlighting any discrepancies. The `analyze_grid_diff` function is helpful for debugging.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a summary of what the code execution tells us, focusing on critical observations:

*   **Example 1:** The code correctly transforms the input. The shapes and relative positions of the azure (8) and white (0) pixels are maintained after the -90 degree rotation.
*   **Example 2:** Works correctly. The transformation is simply identifying a -90 degree rotation.
*   **Example 3:** Works correctly. The transformation is simply identifying a -90 degree rotation.
*   **Example 4:** Works correctly. The transformation is simply identifying a -90 degree rotation.

All training examples provided match perfectly, which means the initial hypothesis works.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is transformed into the output grid by rotating it by -90 degrees.
  - objects:
      - grid: The entire 2D array of pixels.
      - pixels: Individual cells within the grid, each with a color value (0-9).
  - properties:
      - grid_dimensions: The height and width of the grid (consistent within each example, but can vary between examples).
      - pixel_color: The color value of each pixel.
  - actions:
      - rotate_grid: The grid is rotated -90 degrees (clockwise).
  - validations:
      - all_examples_passed: True. The rotation rule holds for all training examples.
```

**Natural Language Program**

```
1.  **Rotate the grid:** Rotate the entire input grid -90 degrees clockwise. This is equivalent to flipping the array vertically and then transposing it.
```
The steps provided are an accurate and clear method for doing a -90 rotation.
