Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a -90 degree rotation of the input grid. This is achieved by first inverting the order of the rows and then transposing the grid (swapping rows and columns).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by rotating it -90 degrees.

    Args:
        input_grid (list of lists): The input grid represented as a list of lists.

    Returns:
        list of lists: The transformed grid.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # 1. Invert Rows: Reverse the order of rows.
    inverted_array = np.flipud(input_array)

    # 2. Transpose: Swap rows and columns.
    output_array = inverted_array.transpose()

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis of a -90-degree rotation was partially correct, as evidenced by its success on the first training example. However, the subsequent failures indicate that the transformation is more complex or context-dependent than initially assumed. The consistent failures on examples 2, 3, and 4 suggest a systematic error in the current understanding of the rule. We need to carefully examine the differences between the input, expected output, and actual output of the failed cases to pinpoint the missing elements of the transformation rule. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Comparison:** Meticulously comparing the input, expected output, and actual output for each example, focusing on object properties (color, size, position) and their changes.
2.  **Pattern Identification:** Searching for consistent patterns in how objects are transformed or re-arranged across the failed examples.
3.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Revising the natural language program to incorporate the newly identified patterns and constraints.
4.  **Iterative Testing:** Re-testing the revised program against all examples after each modification.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for detailed analysis):**

**Observations:**

-   **Example 1:** The initial example has numerous differences, indicating a more substantial error than just rotation. The distribution of `8`s and `0`s is significantly altered. The -90 degree rotation doesn't preserve the overall structure.
-   **Examples 2, 3, and 4:** These examples have single colored pixels at the corners. The expected output *preserves* the input. The -90-degree rotation moves them. This strongly suggests that the correct transformation is to *keep single-pixel objects at the corners unchanged*.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - description: Single-pixel objects
    properties:
      size: 1x1
      location: corners of the grid
      colors: varied (1, 2, 3, etc.)
    transformation:
      rule: remain unchanged
      details: position and color are preserved

  - description: Multi-pixel object (Example 1)
    properties:
      size: > 1x1
      location: spans multiple rows and columns
      colors: 8 and 0
    transformation:
      rule: -90 degree rotation #initial assessment - likely incorrect, needs update
      details:  Appears to be a rotation but with significant differences. Requires more analysis.

actions:
  - name: Identity
    description:  Single pixels at the corners are kept at their original positions.
  - name: Rotation_Complex  # Keep the name consistent for iterative updates
    description: Multi-pixel objects transformation rule (to be determined)
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify single-pixel objects located at the corners of the input grid.** If a pixel is at any of the four corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) and has no adjacent pixels of the same color, it is considered a single-pixel object.
2.  **Preserve single-pixel corner objects.** These objects are copied directly to the output grid at the same coordinates.
3.  **For all other parts of the grid (multi-pixel objects or regions):** Perform a -90 degree rotation. *This part needs revision. The current -90 degree rotation does not correctly reflect the transformations in Example 1*. We need further analysis of how the '8' and '0' pattern is transformed in Example 1 to specify correctly. It is very likely that the input example with more than 1 pixel object is not a simple rotation. It is very likely the presence of corner single pixels is *masking* the more complex rule.

Based on the analysis, the key update is the explicit handling of single-pixel objects at the corners. The transformation of the rest of the grid, as illustrated by Example 1, requires more analysis. The updated natural language program reflects this understanding and highlights the area requiring further refinement.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
