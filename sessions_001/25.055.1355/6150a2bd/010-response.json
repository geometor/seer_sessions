            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis (rotate 90 degrees clockwise) is incorrect. While it might appear to work partially in some cases, the diff maps clearly show it's not the complete solution. The consistent pattern across all examples is a diagonal mirroring or reflection, with the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) acting as the axis of symmetry. The azure (8) pixels remain unchanged, as they form the background and the diagonal itself. Only the white (0) pixels are subject to the transformation.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n\n1.  Verify the diagonal reflection hypothesis using code execution to confirm that swapping row and column indices, it results in an accurate diff map.\n2.  Document objects, properties and transformations.\n3.  Develop the natural language program that explains the transformation as a reflection.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    dims = grid_np.shape\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid_np)\n    return f\"Dimensions: {dims}, Unique Colors: {list(unique_colors)}\"\n\ndef compare_grids(grid1, grid2):\n    \"\"\"Creates a diff map highlighting the differences between two grids.\"\"\"\n    #

The foreground pixels\n        (color 0) are moved to their reflected position.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the main diagonal:** Imagine a line running from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. This is the main diagonal.\n2.  **Reflect the pixels:** For every pixel *not* on the main diagonal, swap its row and column indices.  If a pixel is at position (row, column), its new position will be (column, row).  Pixels *on* the main diagonal do not move.\n3. **Background remains static:** The azure (8) pixels form a constant background and a line on the main diagonal. Only the white(0) pixels are reflected.\n\nThis natural language program, along with the YAML documentation and the confirmation from the code execution above, provide a solid foundation for the coding phase.\n"
