    description: >
        The grid is reflected across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
        This is equivalent to swapping the row and column indices of each pixel (i, j) -> (j, i).
        The background color (8) remains unchanged. The foreground pixels
        (color 0) are moved to their reflected position.
