            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a plan to develop a robust transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was very basic, simply printing out grid information and color counts. It didn't implement any transformation logic. The key observation from all examples is that the output is always a single-pixel grid with a constant color. This strongly suggests the transformation involves summarizing the entire input grid into a single value based on some property of the input. The varying output colors (3 and 9) across different examples indicate that this property is not simply a fixed color, but is derived from the input. The input grids vary in size and color, so those should be investigated.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Input Properties:** The critical element is determining *what* property of the input grid dictates the output color. Obvious candidates include:\n    *   The dominant color in the input.\n    *   The presence/absence of specific colors.\n    *   The size of the input grid.\n    *   The dimensions\n    *   The number and arrangement of objects (contiguous regions of the same color).\n\n2.  **Iterative Hypothesis Refinement:** We'll form a hypothesis about the determining property, write a natural language program to describe it, and translate that into code. We'll test the code against *all* examples and revise the hypothesis based on the results.\n\n3.  **Prioritize Simplicity:**  Given the ARC priors, we should start with the simplest hypotheses (e.g., presence of a color) before moving to more complex ones (e.g., relationships between objects).\n\n**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution Results - already available):**\n\nLet's recap the provided code execution results:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, mostly white (0), with a 3x3 azure (8) block.\n    *   Output: 1x1 green (3).\n    *   Input colors and counts: `{0: 72, 8: 9}`\n    *   Output colors and counts: `{3: 1}`\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, mostly white (0), with a 3x3 orange (7) block.\n    *   Output: 1x1 green (3).\n    *   Input colors and counts: `{0: 72, 7: 9}`\n    *   Output colors and counts: `{3: 1}`\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, mostly white (0), with a 3x3 gray (5) block.\n    *   Output: 1x1 green (3).\n    *   Input colors and counts: `{0: 72, 5: 9}`\n    *   Output colors and counts: `{3: 1}`\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, mostly white (0), with a 3x3 red (2) block.\n    *   Output: 1x1 green (3).\n    *   Input colors and counts: `{0: 72, 2: 9}`\n    *   Output colors and counts: `{3: 1}`\n\n*   **Example 5:**\n    *   Input: 9x9, entirely blue (1).\n    *   Output: 1x1 maroon (9).\n    *   Input colors and counts: `{1: 81}`\n    *   Output colors and counts: `{9: 1}`\n\n**Key Observations and Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Consistent Output Size:** All outputs are 1x1 grids.\n2.  **Two Output Colors:** Only green (3) and maroon (9) appear in the output.\n3.  **Input Grid Size constant:** All input grids are 9 x 9\n4.  **Green (3) Output Condition:** Examples 1-4 all result in green (3). They share the characteristic of having a 3x3 block of a non-white color within a larger white grid.\n5.  **Maroon (9) Output Condition:** Example 5 results in maroon (9). It's entirely filled with blue (1).\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\n*   If the input grid is entirely filled with a single color, the output is maroon (9).\n*   If the input grid contains a 3x3 block of any color other than white, and the rest of the grid is white, the output is green (3).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: input_grid\n    properties:\n      size: 9x9\n      content: 2D array of color values (0-9)\n\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n      size: 1x1\n      content: single color value\n\n  - observation: output_color_choices\n    details: Output is always either green (3) or maroon (9).\n\n  - observation: input_grid_contents\n    details: Input grids are either a single color or contain white and one other 3x3 block of color\n\n  - rule: uniform_color_rule\n    condition: Input grid is entirely a single color.\n    output: maroon (9)\n\n  - rule: mixed_color_rule\n    condition: Input grid contains a 3x3 block of a non-white color, and the rest is white.\n    output: green (3)\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Examine the input grid.\n2.  If all pixels in the input grid have the same color, the output is a 1x1 grid with the color maroon (9).\n3.  If input grid has any color that forms a single 3 x 3 block, and the remaining pixels are white, the output grid is 1x1 with the color green(3).\n4.  Otherwise return Error.\n"
