## Example 2

**input:**
```
8 0 8
0 8 0
8 0 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CA710>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFF3CBEB0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit numbers (representing colors). The output appears to be a single-digit number within its own 1x1 grid. The input grid has a symmetrical pattern with '8' (azure) forming a cross shape and '0' (white) filling the remaining cells. The output is '2' (red). The core task seems to involve analyzing the input grid's structure and content to produce a single-digit output. The relationship between the input grid and the output '2' is not immediately obvious, but must involve counting, shape recognition, or a combination of operations on those elements. The color of the output (red) and the colors in the input (white and azure) will likely be significant, as they represent the integers.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        positions: [[0, 0], [0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0], [2, 2]]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        positions: [[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]]
  - type: single_value
    description: output value
    value: 2
    color: red
  - observation: "azure pixels form a cross shape"
  - observation: "output is a single pixel."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count the occurrences of the most frequent color.** Analyze the input grid and identify the color that appears most frequently, excluding white (0).
2.  **Count adjacent like colors.** For the most frequent color, find occurrences where adjacent vertical and horizontal (not diagonal) pixels are the same color
3.  **Return the result.** The final output is the result of the counting.

Based on this, the program focuses on first finding the most frequent non-white color, and then counting vertically and horizontally adjacent pixels of this color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
