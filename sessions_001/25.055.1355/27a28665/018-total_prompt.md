Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, which is insufficient to capture the full complexity of the transformation. The results on the other training examples show that the code doesn't generalize well. The core idea of counting white regions bounded by the most frequent non-white color is sometimes relevant, but not always. In some cases, the output is simply 0, and in another, it relates to the number of a specific color present. It also doesn't appear to be related to the bounding color. We need to re-evaluate the core logic and look for alternative patterns or relationships.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Re-examine all Examples:** Disregard the initial hypothesis and treat all training examples as equally informative.
2.  **Identify Common Elements:** Look for consistent relationships between input and output across *all* examples, not just one.
3.  **Consider Simpler Rules:** Start with the simplest possible rules (e.g., counting specific colors, presence/absence of colors) before moving to complex ones like region counting.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Develop a new natural language program, translate it to code, test it, and repeat the process until all training examples are correctly handled.
5. **Focus on input/output differences**: Look at all of the inputs and determine the simplest rule

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including code execution results to verify our observations:

```python
def analyze_example(example):
    input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
    output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
    print(f"Input grid:\n{input_grid}\n")
    print(f"Output grid:\n{output_grid}\n")
    unique_input, input_counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)
    print(f"Input colors and counts: {dict(zip(unique_input, input_counts))}")

    unique_output, output_counts = np.unique(output_grid, return_counts=True)
    print(f"Output colors and counts: {dict(zip(unique_output, output_counts))}\n")

    # Check for the current hypothesis (bounding).  Not very useful.
    # if len(input_counts) > 1: #at least one other color
    #   max_color_index = np.argmax(input_counts[1:]) + 1
    #   max_color = unique_input[max_color_index]
    #   bounding_count = count_regions(input_grid, 0, max_color)
    #   print(f"{bounding_count=}")

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_1:
      input:
        colors: [white, azure]
        azure_count: 9
        white_count: 72
        shape: 9x9 rectangle
      output:
        value: 3
  - example_2:
      input:
        colors: [white, orange]
        orange_count: 9
        white_count: 72
        shape: 9x9 rectangle
      output:
        value: 3
  - example_3:
      input:
        colors: [white, gray]
        gray_count: 9
        white_count: 72
        shape: 9x9 rectangle
      output:
        value: 3
  - example_4:
      input:
        colors: [white, red]
        red_count: 9
        white_count: 72
        shape: 9x9 rectangle
      output:
        value: 3
  - example_5:
      input:
        colors: [blue]
        blue_count: 81
        shape: 9x9 rectangle
      output:
          value: 9

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input grid.
2.  If the input contains a 3x3 block of a single color, and the rest of the grid is white (color 0), then the output is the integer value `3`.
3.  If the input grid is completely filled with a single color, then the output is a single-pixel grid with a value equal to the count of input grid's height.
4. Otherwise the output is 0

The key observation is that examples 1-4 have an identical structure, and example 5 follows a separate rule that can be used as an "else" condition..

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
