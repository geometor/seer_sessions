## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 0 5
0 5 0
5 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>

**output:**
```
2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFF213340>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, visualized as colored squares. The output is a single-digit integer, also visualized with color. The core task seems to involve analyzing the numbers/colors within the input grid and producing a single number/color as output. The specific rule connecting the input grid to the output number isn't immediately obvious, but it likely involves counting, color comparison, or spatial relationships.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: input
    description: 3x3 grid
    elements:
      - value: 5  # Gray
        positions: [(0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)]
      - value: 0  # white
        positions: [(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)]
      - value: 5 # Gray
        positions: [(1,1)]
  - type: output
    description: single integer
    value: 2  # Red
  - observation: Gray pixels are on the corners and in the center.
  - observation: white pixels fill the remaining positions - adjacent to gray
  - observation: input is always a grid
  - observation: output is always a single value

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of distinct colors present in the input grid, excluding white (0).
2.  The output is the number of distinct non-white colors.

In the provided example, the input grid contains only one color other than white, which is gray (5). Therefore, the count of distinct non-white colors is 1. However, the provided output is 2 (red).

Here is a revised, better, natural language program:
1. Count the number of instances of the most frequent color other than color white (0).

2. If the count from step 1. is greater than 1, output the number of white (0) regions bound by this color.

In the example input, the most frequent color other than white (0) is grey (5) with 5 occurences. There are two distinct white regions that are surrounded by this grey color, i.e. cornered by the grey color, so output is 2.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
