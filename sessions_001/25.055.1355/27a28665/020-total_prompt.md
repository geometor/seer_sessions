## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 1 1
0 1 1
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>

**output:**
```
3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFF1048B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a single numerical value. The input grid appears to contain two colors: white (0) and blue (1). The output is a single digit, which in this example is '3'. The key seems to be related to counting a specific color within the input grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
task: count_color
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [white, blue]
      - cell_values: [0, 1]
  - type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 3
actions:
  - type: count
    target: color
    value: blue
relationships:
  - input: grid
  - output: integer
  - description: The output integer represents the number of blue pixels in the input grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target color:** In this example, the target color is blue (represented by the value 1).
2.  **Count the occurrences:** Iterate through all the pixels in the input grid.
3.  **Increment a counter:** For each pixel that matches the target color (blue/1), increment a counter.
4. **Output the result** Output the final count as a single integer.

In essence, the program counts the number of blue pixels in the input grid and outputs that count.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
