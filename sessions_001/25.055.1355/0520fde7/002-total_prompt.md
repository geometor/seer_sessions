## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 0 0 5 0 1 0
0 1 0 5 1 1 1
1 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF213340>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to have a pattern involving blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid is smaller and seems to focus on a single red (2) pixel in the center, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The gray (5) pixels in input seems to be an indicator of the row and location for the red (2) pixel.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 3x7
        elements: [0, 1, 5] # white, blue, gray
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 3x3
        elements: [0, 2] # white, red

actions:
  - name: locate_center_column
    input: input_grid
    description: Find the column index containing the gray (5) pixels.

  - name: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid, center_column
    description: Create a 3x3 subgrid centered around the indicated position.

  - name: replace_color
    input: subgrid
    description: Replace the color in center with the output.
    details: original value (1 - blue) is replaced by (2 - red). other values are replaced by (0 - white)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a 3x3 region extracted from the input grid.
  - type: positional
    description: The gray (5) pixels in the input grid determine the central column of the extracted region which becomes the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Center Column:** Find the column in the input grid that contains the gray (5) pixels. This column represents the x-coordinate of the center of the output.
2.  **Determine output value row:** The row number of the output is same as the input.
3. **Create Subgrid:** make all values in the subgrid white (0) except the central one which should be red (2)


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
