facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grids contain a single vertical stripe of gray pixels.
  - observation: |
      The input grids may contain blue pixels to the left and/or right of the gray stripe.
  - observation: |
      The output grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: |
     The output grid contains red pixels in the same row as any blue input pixels
  - observation: |
      The output grid's red pixels appear in a column that corresponds to if they were to the left or right of the grey stripe.
  - observation: |
      In the output, if the blue pixel was to the left of the gray stripe, a red pixel is placed in column 0 of the same row.
  - observation: |
      In the output, if the blue pixel was to the right of the gray stripe, a red pixel is placed in column 1 if it's the first to the right, of the same row.
  - observation: |
      Example 3 shows there can be blue pixels on *both* sides and multiple on the same side.
  - action: |
      Identify the column index of the gray stripe.
  - action: |
      For each row, check for blue pixels to the left and right of the gray stripe.
  - action: |
      A red pixel is placed in the output in the same row, in column 0, and column 1 depending if the blue was to the left or right.
