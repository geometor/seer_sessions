Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Blue Pixels:** Examine the input grid to locate all blue (value 1) pixels.
2. **Bounding Box**: If there are no blue pixels, return a 3x3 grid of zeros. If there are blue pixels, find the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains all blue pixels.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:**
    *   If a bounding box can be identified, extract the bounding box.
    *   If the bounding box is smaller than 3x3, pad it with zeros (color 0) on all sides to make it 3x3. Pad on the left first, then right, then top, then bottom as needed.
4.  **Recolor:** Within the extracted 3x3 subgrid, change all blue (value 1) pixels to red (value 2).
5.  **Output:** present extracted and recolored subgrid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
