## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 0 5 0 1 0
0 0 1 5 1 1 1
1 1 0 5 0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DB6D0>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
0 0 2
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF213DF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured observations, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x7 grid with numerical values representing colors (blue, white, and gray). There's a distinct vertical line of gray (5) in the center.
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid, seemingly derived from the input. It contains white and red colors.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve extracting a specific region of the input and changing some colors. The output grid is significantly smaller.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
observations:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x7
    elements:
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: gray
        value: 5
    features:
      - central_column:
        value: 5 # Gray
        location: 4 # Column index 3 (starting from 0)

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
         value: 0
      - color: red
        value: 2
    features: []

  - action: extraction
    description: A subgrid is extracted from the input grid.
    parameters:
      size: 3x3

  - action: color_change
    description: Some colors in the extracted subgrid are modified.
    parameters:
      input_color: blue
      output_color: red

  - relationship: subgrid_selection
    description: The central 3x3 section, based on the gray line, is where the extraction occurs.
    parameters:{}
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Center:** Locate the vertical line of gray (value 5) pixels in the input grid. This line serves as a vertical center marker.
2.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a 3x3 subgrid centered around the identified gray line. Specifically, take the pixels one column to the left and one column to the right of the center column, and all three rows.
3.  **Recolor:** Within the extracted 3x3 subgrid, change all blue (value 1) pixels to red (value 2). Leave white (value 0) unchanged.
4. **Output:** present extracted and recolored subgrid.

In essence, the program identifies a region of interest (the 3x3 area around the central gray line), extracts it, and performs a color substitution within that region.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
