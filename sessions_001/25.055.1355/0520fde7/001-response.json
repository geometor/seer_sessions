The input grid appears to have a pattern involving blue (1), white (0), and gray (5) pixels. The output grid is smaller and seems to focus on a single red (2) pixel in the center, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The gray (5) pixels in input seems to be an indicator of the row and location for the red (2) pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
