            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on a simple rotation of colors in a counter-clockwise manner, specifically targeting corner and adjacent pixels. This assumption proved too narrow, as evidenced by the test results on the full training set. The provided code only works for the first example and fails to generalize to other examples. The core issue is that the initial observation was overly specific to the first example's geometry and didn't capture the underlying general rule. The rule is not a simple rotation of colors in fixed positions. Rather, it is a cyclical color swap amongst a *specific set* of colors.\n\nMy strategy to resolve this is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze Results**: Examine all input/output pairs to identify consistent color transformations.\n2.  **Identify the Color Cycle**: Determine the precise sequence of colors that are being swapped. The original program did not describe a color transformation, but a pixel position rotation.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program**: Rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the cyclical color substitution.\n4. **Prepare for Code modification**: I will use observations from all examples.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the color transformations, I will manually inspect the input/output grids for each example and record the mappings.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[1, 8, 8], [8, 2, 8], [8, 8, 3]]`\n    *   Output: `[[2, 8, 8], [8, 3, 8], [8, 8, 1]]`\n    *   Observed color changes: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1.  8 remains unchanged.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[2, 8, 3], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`\n    *   Output: `[[3, 8, 1], [5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`\n    *   Observed color changes: 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1, 1 is not present. 5 and 8 are unchanged.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[2, 3, 3], [8, 1, 2], [3, 2, 8]]`\n    *   Output: `[[3, 1, 1], [8, 2, 3], [1, 3, 8]]`\n    *    Observed color change: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, and 3 -> 1. 8 remains unchanged\n\n* **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: `[[3, 3, 3, 2], [3, 3, 8, 3], [8, 3, 3, 3], [1, 8, 3, 3]]`\n    *   Output: `[[1, 1, 1, 3], [1, 1, 8, 1], [8, 1, 1, 1], [2, 8, 1, 1]]`\n    *   Observed color changes: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1. 8 remains unchanged\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: grid\n    properties: 2D array of color values\n    actions: elements change color values\n  - object: colors\n    properties: represented by integers 0-9\n    actions: specific colors are replaced by other specific colors in a cyclical manner.\n  - observation: The colors 1, 2, and 3 are involved in a cycle.\n  - observation: Color 8 always remains unchanged.\n  - observation: Colors other than 1, 2, 3, and 8 are unchanged.\n  - color_cycle: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  If the pixel's color is 1, change it to 2.\n3.  If the pixel's color is 2, change it to 3.\n4.  If the pixel's color is 3, change it to 1.\n5.  Leave all other colors unchanged.\n6. The output is the modified grid.\n"
