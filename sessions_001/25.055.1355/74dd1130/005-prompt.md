Previous Code:
```python
"""
The initial hypothesis of a simple 90-degree clockwise rotation is incorrect. The transformation rule appears to be more complex and potentially involves different operations depending on the input grid's characteristics. Further analysis of failing examples is needed. Based on visual inspection, it *might* involve identifying specific shapes/objects within the grid and applying different rotational transformations to them individually, or potentially mirroring operations. The provided examples suggest that the transformation might also be dependent on the size or arrangement of certain colored regions. The current code only performs a 90-degree clockwise rotation, so let's adapt the `transform` function.

Based on further review, this task appears too complex for a single, consistent transformation.

"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Applies a 90-degree clockwise rotation as a placeholder.
    A more sophisticated analysis and transformation logic is required to solve the task.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid

```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
