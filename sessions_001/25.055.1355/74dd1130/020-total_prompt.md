## Example 4

**input:**
```
2 6 6
2 1 1
2 6 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF1048B0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
6 1 6
6 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B7490>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The cells within the grids contain single-digit integers, representing colors. The input and output grids share a similar structure, but the arrangement and specific values of the colors differ. The black borders are not encoded in the input or output representation but are important for understanding the objectness of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: cell
        properties:
          value: integer (0-9)
          color:  mapped from value (see COLOR_MAP in instructions)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are arranged in rows and columns.
  - type: color_correspondence
    description: specific colors are repeated in the grids

actions:
  - type: transpose
    description: the grid appears to have had a transpose action applied to it, with rows and columns interchanged
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves transposing the input grid. Specifically, the rows of the input grid become the columns of the output grid, and vice versa.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid with integer values in each cell.
2. **Transpose rows and columns:** the row at index `i` becomes column `i` in the output, column at index `j` becomes row at index `j` in the output.
3.  **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid after transpose.

Essentially this is a matrix transposition operation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
