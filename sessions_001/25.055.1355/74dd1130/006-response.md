"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into distinct objects. An object is defined as a contiguous group of pixels of the same color.  Connectivity is 4-way (not diagonal).
2.  **Individual Transformation:** Each object is transformed independently, as follows.
    * Orange 'L' shape is mirrored and rotated to the opposite side
    * Single orange pixels show no positional change
    * Other Orange shapes - TBD (need to identify specific rules)
3.  **Blue Pixel Movement:** Single blue pixels change their relative position to the orange shapes. (Need a precise rule for this movement – potentially relative to the bounding box of the orange objects.)
4. **Grid Preservation**: The size of the grid is constant
