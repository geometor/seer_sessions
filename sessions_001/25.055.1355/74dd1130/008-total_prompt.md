## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 2 5
6 2 2
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CA6E0>

**output:**
```
2 6 5
2 2 5
5 2 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF213DF0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input and Output Grids:** Both input and output are 3x3 grids. The values within the grids represent colors.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain the colors red (2), grey (5), and magenta (6).
*   **Color Changes:** Some colors change between the input and output, while others remain the same. The most notable is magenta changing to red in the first output

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        values: [2, 5, 6]  # Red, Grey, Magenta

actions:
  - type: color_change
    details: Conditional color swap based on initial color and position.

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    description: The input grid transforms into the output grid according to a specific rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each cell of the input grid.
2.  The colors are rotated in place in counter-clockwise manner.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
