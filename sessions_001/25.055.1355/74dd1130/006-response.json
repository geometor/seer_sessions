Connectivity is 4-way (not diagonal).\n2.  **Individual Transformation:** Each object is transformed independently, as follows.\n    * Orange 'L' shape is mirrored and rotated to the opposite side\n    * Single orange pixels show no positional change\n    * Other Orange shapes - TBD (need to identify specific rules)\n3.  **Blue Pixel Movement:** Single blue pixels change their relative position to the orange shapes. (Need a precise rule for this movement \u2013 potentially relative to the bounding box of the orange objects.)\n4. **Grid Preservation**: The size of the grid is constant\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_objects(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies distinct objects in the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: A 2D list representing the input grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of objects, where each object is a list of (row, col) tuples\n        representing the pixel coordinates of the object.\n    \"\"\"\n    visited = set()\n    objects = []\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, current_object):\n        if (row, col) in visited or not (0 <= row < len(grid) and 0 <= col < len(grid[0])) or grid[row][col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        current_object.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, current_object)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, current_object)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, current_object)\n\n    for row in range(len(grid)):\n        for col in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if (row, col) not in visited:\n                color = grid[row][col]\n                current_object = []\n                dfs(row, col, color, current_object)\n                if current_object:  # Avoid empty objects\n                    objects.append(current_object)\n    return objects\n\ndef transform_l_shape(obj, grid_shape):\n    \"\"\"Transforms an L-shaped object (specifically for orange color 7).\n       Mirrors and rotates.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = zip(*obj)\n    min_row, min_col = min(rows), min(cols)\n    # Normalize to origin\n    normalized_obj = [(r - min_row, c - min_col) for r, c in obj]\n\n    # Check if it's an L-shape (crude check based on relative positions)\n    is_l_shape = False\n    if len(obj) == 4:  # Simplest L has 4 pixels\n        # Check for basic L-shape configurations (this is not exhaustive)\n        if (0, 0) in normalized_obj and (0, 1) in normalized_obj and (0, 2) in normalized_obj and (1, 0) in normalized_obj:\n            is_l_shape = True\n        elif (0, 0) in normalized_obj and (1, 0) in normalized_obj and (2, 0) in normalized_obj and (2, 1) in normalized_obj:\n            is_l_shape = True\n\n        # Add more L shape checks as needed.\n\n    if is_l_shape:\n        # Mirror and rotate - example for one L-shape.
