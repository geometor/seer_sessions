## Example 4

**input:**
```
3 3 8
4 4 4
8 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF1061D0>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
4 4 4
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DB670>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3). The colors in the output seem to be derived from the input, but not in a straightforward pixel-to-pixel mapping.  The central horizontal row of yellow (4) pixels remains constant. The other colors change. Green(3) and Blue (8) become grey (5), and azure(8) and blue(1) become gray (5). There appear to be two main color regions influenced by a single color.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids are 3x3.
  - observation: The middle row of the input grid (yellow) remains unchanged in the output grid.
  - observation: All colors other than yellow in the input grid become grey in the output grid.
  - objects:
    - name: input_grid
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      properties:
        - row_1: [green, green, azure]
        - row_2: [yellow, yellow, yellow]
        - row_3: [azure, blue, blue]
    - name: output_grid
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      properties:
        - row_1: [grey, grey, grey]
        - row_2: [yellow, yellow, yellow]
        - row_3: [grey, grey, grey]
  - relationships:
      - type: unchanged
        subject: input_grid.row_2
        object: output_grid.row_2
      - type: color_change_conditional
        subject: input_grid[not yellow]
        object: output_grid[grey]
        condition: if pixel in input_grid is not yellow change to grey

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy Middle Row:** Copy the middle row (row index 1) of the input grid directly to the output grid.
2. **Change other colors**: Change any color in the input other than yellow to grey in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
