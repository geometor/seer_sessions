The input grid contains pixels of various colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors, retaining blue and introducing gray. The transformation seems to involve a color change based on some rule related to the initial color distribution.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
