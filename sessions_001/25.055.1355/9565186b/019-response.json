The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3). The colors in the output seem to be derived from the input, but not in a straightforward pixel-to-pixel mapping.  The central horizontal row of yellow (4) pixels remains constant. The other colors change. Green(3) and Blue (8) become grey (5), and azure(8) and blue(1) become gray (5). There appear to be two main color regions influenced by a single color.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
