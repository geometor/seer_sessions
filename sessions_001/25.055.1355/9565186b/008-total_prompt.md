## Example 2

**input:**
```
1 1 1
8 1 3
8 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>

**output:**
```
1 1 1
5 1 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46C160>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains pixels of various colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors, retaining blue and introducing gray. The transformation seems to involve a color change based on some rule related to the initial color distribution.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    description: Input grid with various colors.
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    description: Output grid with simplified colors.
  - type: object
    description: Individual pixels within the grids.
    properties:
      - color: Initial color value (1, 8, 3, 2).
      - new_color: Transformed color value (1, 5).
  - type: action
    description: Color transformation.
    rule: "Pixels with initial color 8, 3, or 2 (azure, green, red) are changed to color 5 (gray). Color 1 (blue) remains unchanged."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of the current pixel.
3.  **If** the color is 1 (blue), keep the color unchanged in the output grid.
4.  **Else if** the color is 8, 3, or 2 (azure, green, or red), change the color to 5 (gray) in the output grid.
5.  **Output** the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
