The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, specifically, halving both the width and height. The colors and their relative positions seem to be preserved in the transformation. It appears the transformation is extracting a specific region, a sub-grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This is achieved by taking the width and dividing by 2, taking the height and dividing by two, and creating a new grid with the new dimensions. The content of the new grid consists of elements copied from the input grid.\n\nIn simpler terms, we can define the transformation like so:\n1.  **Calculate Output Dimensions:** Divide the input grid's width and height by two to get the output grid's dimensions.\n2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Copy the pixels from the top-left quadrant of the input grid to the output grid, preserving their colors and relative positions.\n\nEssentially, the program takes the top-left quarter of the image.\n"
