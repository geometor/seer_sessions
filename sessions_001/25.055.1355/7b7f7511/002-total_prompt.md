## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 3 2 1 1 3 2
1 1 3 3 1 1 3 3
3 3 1 1 3 3 1 1
2 3 1 1 2 3 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=512x256 at 0x7DCBFF46E320>

**output:**
```
1 1 3 2
1 1 3 3
3 3 1 1
2 3 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x256 at 0x7DCBFF46D7B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be a larger version of the output grid. The transformation seems to involve a reduction in the size of the grid, specifically, halving both the width and height. The colors and their relative positions seem to be preserved in the transformation. It appears the transformation is extracting a specific region, a sub-grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D
      - cells: pixels
      - colors: [blue, green, red]
      - width: 8 (input), 4 (output)
      - height: 4 (input), 2 (output)

actions:
  - type: size_reduction
    description: The grid's dimensions are halved.

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: pixel positions and colors in the reduced output grid correspond directly to a sub-region of the input grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation extracts the top-left quadrant (or quarter-sized sub-grid) of the input grid. This is achieved by taking the width and dividing by 2, taking the height and dividing by two, and creating a new grid with the new dimensions. The content of the new grid consists of elements copied from the input grid.

In simpler terms, we can define the transformation like so:
1.  **Calculate Output Dimensions:** Divide the input grid's width and height by two to get the output grid's dimensions.
2.  **Extract Sub-grid:** Copy the pixels from the top-left quadrant of the input grid to the output grid, preserving their colors and relative positions.

Essentially, the program takes the top-left quarter of the image.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
