## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA6E0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The values in the grid are either 0 or 1, corresponding to white and blue, respectively. The transformation appears to involve a shift or movement of the row containing the blue pixels.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 1]
    element_meaning:
      0: white
      1: blue
  - observation: input_row_with_ones: 0 # Row index (0-based)
    output_row_with_ones: 1 # Row index (0-based)
  - action: row_shift
    direction: down
    magnitude: 1
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is to move the row containing all blue pixels (value 1) down by one position. The other rows, containing all white pixels (value 0) shift to fill vacated position. In other words, it's a cyclic permutation on rows, where all rows are moved downwards and last row wraps to the first.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
