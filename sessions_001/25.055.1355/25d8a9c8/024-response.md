1.  **Identify Bottom Row Colors:** Examine the bottom row of the input grid and identify the unique colors present, preserving their order and count.
2.  **Populate Output Bottom Row:** Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid. Fill the bottom row of the *output* grid with the colors identified in the *input* grid's bottom row, preserving their order and count.
3.  **Fill Remaining Cells:** Fill all remaining cells in the output grid (those *not* in the bottom row) with white (0).
