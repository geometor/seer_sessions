## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 4
9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF213340>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
5 5 5
5 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DB6D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of colored pixels into another 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors in the input grid seem to correspond to specific colors in the output grid. The spatial arrangement of the pixels (a 3x3 grid) is maintained during the transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: varies (represented by integers)
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9)
  - relation: color_mapping
    type: many-to-one
    details:
      input_colors: [2, 9, 4]
      output_colors: [0, 5]
  - transformation:
      type: color replacement
      details:  All pixels of colors in input grid replaced by corresponding color from the input to output mapping.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule can be described as a color substitution. Observe each input pixel.
Replace pixels according to these rules:
1. If the pixel is red (2) or white(0), change it to white (0).
2. If the pixel is yellow (4) or maroon(9), change it to gray (5).

This maintains the original 3x3 grid structure while applying a specific color mapping.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
