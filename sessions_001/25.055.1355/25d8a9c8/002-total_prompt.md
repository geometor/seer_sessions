## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 4
2 3 2
2 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D4040>

**output:**
```
5 5 5
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D7A00>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers) into another grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x3 in this case). The colors in the input grid seem to be replaced by different colors in the output grid based on their original color. The transformation appears to be a simple color mapping.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: [4, 2, 3]  # Unique colors in the input grid.

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color: [5, 0]  # Unique colors in the output grid.

  - type: transformation
    description: color mapping
    mapping:
      4: 5
      2: 0
      3: 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color substitution.  Each pixel in the input grid is replaced with a new color in the output grid based on the following mapping:

1.  Yellow (4) pixels in the input become Gray (5) pixels in the output.
2.  Red (2) pixels in the input become White (0) pixels in the output.
3.  Green (3) pixels in the input become White (0) pixels in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
