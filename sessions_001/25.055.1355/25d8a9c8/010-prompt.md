Previous Code:
```python
def code_execution(code, input_data):
    """
    Executes Python code with given input data and captures both standard output and errors.
    Args:
        code (str): A string containing the Python code to be executed.
        input_data (dict): A dictionary where keys are variable names and values are the corresponding
                           data to be made available to the code.
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing:
            - "stdout": A list of strings representing captured standard output.
            - "stderr": A list of strings representing captured error messages.
            - "locals":  A dictionary containing the local variables after code execution,
                         or None if an error occurred.  Variables named with leading
                         underscores are filtered out.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
