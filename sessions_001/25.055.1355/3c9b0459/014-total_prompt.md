## Example 3

**input:**
```
8 8 8
5 5 8
8 5 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212380>

**output:**
```
5 5 8
8 5 5
8 8 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF1061D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The colors present are azure (8) and gray (5). The input and output grids appear to be rotations of each other.  Specifically, it seems like a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [5, 8]  # Gray and Azure

actions:
  - type: rotation
    agent: grid
    direction: clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Input grid is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the output grid."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the entire grid. To transform the input to the output, rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise. This means that:

1.  The top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output.
2.  The middle row of the input becomes the middle column of the output.
3.  The bottom row of the input becomes the leftmost column of the output.

Or, visualized another way, the element at `input[row][col]` moves to `output[col][2-row]`.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
