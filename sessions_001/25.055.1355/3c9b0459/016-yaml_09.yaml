facts:
  - description: "The transformation involves changing a horizontal line of pixels into a vertical line of pixels."
  - property: color
    observation: "The color of the horizontal line is preserved in the vertical line."
  - property: length
    observation: "The length of the horizontal line determines properties of the vertical line."
  - property: position
    observation: "The vertical line is consistently positioned in the center column of the output grid."
  - property: input_grid_dimensions
    observation: "The input grid dimensions can be different to the output grid dimensions."
  - property: output_grid_dimensions
    observation: |
        In all training examples, the output grid height matches the length of the horizontal line,
        except when the height exceeds the length of the input grid, and in that case
        the height becomes the length of the width of the input grid.
        The output grid width is equal to the input grid.
  - property: background
    observation: "Pixels with a value of 0 are considered background and are not part of any object."
  - object: line
    definition: "A contiguous sequence of pixels of the same color, either horizontally or vertically."
