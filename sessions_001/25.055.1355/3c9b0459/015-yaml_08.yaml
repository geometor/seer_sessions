facts:
  - task: "Horizontal to Vertical Lines"
  - observations:
    - description: "Horizontal lines of a single color in the input are transformed into vertical lines of the same color in the output."
    - example_1:
      input_object:
        row: 4
        start_col: 3
        end_col: 5
        color: 1
        length: 3
      output_object:
        row_start: 0
        row_end: 2
        col: 4
        color: 1
        length: 3
    - example_2:
      input_object:
        row: 2
        start_col: 3
        end_col: 5
        color: 5
        length: 3
      output_object:
        row_start: 1
        row_end: 3
        col: 4
        color: 5
        length: 3
    - example_3:
      input_object:
       row: 6
       start_col: 3
       end_col: 6
       color: 2
       length: 4
      output_object:
        row_start: 3
        row_end: 6
        col: 4
        color: 2
        length: 4
    - example_4:
        input: "A block of three rows filled with color 8."
        output: "A block of nine rows and three columns filled with color 8. All other cells become 0."
  - transformation_rule: "A horizontal line of color 'c' and length 'n' starting at input row 'r' and column 's' becomes a vertical line of color 'c' and length 'n', with the top pixel at output row 'r'-(n-1) and column 's' + ((n / 2) rounded down)"
  - exceptions:
      - "If an input grid contains rows that are completely filled, transform into columns with height equal to input width and width equal to the height of the block."
