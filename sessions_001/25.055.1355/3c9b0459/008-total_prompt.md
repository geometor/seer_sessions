## Example 2

**input:**
```
9 2 4
2 4 4
2 9 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF213DF0>

**output:**
```
2 9 2
4 4 2
4 2 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF1048B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a numerical value (0-9) corresponding to a specific color. The transformation appears to involve a manipulation of the grid's rows and columns, potentially a rotation or reflection.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            1: blue
            2: red
            3: green
            4: yellow
            5: gray
            6: magenta
            7: orange
            8: azure
            9: maroon
  - observation: input_grid
    values: |
      9 2 4
      2 4 4
      2 9 2
  - observation: output_grid
    values: |
      2 9 2
      4 4 2
      4 2 9
  - transformation:
      type: grid_manipulation
      description: "Rows and columns are rearranged."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves rotating the input grid clockwise by 90 degrees. Specifically, it's performing these operations:

1.  The first row of the input becomes the last column of the output.
2.  The second row of the input becomes the second-to-last column of the output
3.  The third row of the input becomes the first column of the output.

Another way to view it:

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
