## Example 4

**input:**
```
3 2 9
9 9 9
2 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212680>

**output:**
```
3 3 2
9 9 9
9 2 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212380>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors.  The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the digits/colors within the grid, not a change in the digits themselves. The most prominent colors are green (3), maroon (9), and red (2).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: determined by integer value (COLOR_MAP)
  - type: pixel
    properties:
       - value: integer (0-9)
       - color: determined by integer value
       - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: rearrangement
    description: Pixels are reordered within the grid.

relationships:
   - grid contains pixels
   - input grid transforms to output grid

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Observe:** Examine the input grid.
2.  **Identify:** Note the positions of all pixels.
3.  **Transform:** The input grid is transformed into the output grid by swapping elements on the anti-diagonal using the following detailed instructions:
    - The element at position (0,0) swaps with (0,1), so the top left and top center swaps position
    - The element at position (2,0) swaps with position (2,1), so the bottom left and bottom center swaps position
    - The element at (0,2) swaps with (1,1), so the top right and center values are swapped
    - The element at position(2,1) swaps with (1,1), so the bottom center and center values are swapped
4.  **Output:** Present the modified grid as the output.

In essence, the transformation involves a localized swapping of pixel values, as described above.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
