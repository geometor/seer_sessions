The input and output grids appear to have the same dimensions.  The transformation doesn't seem to involve simply changing colors, but rather a rearrangement or mirroring of the grid's contents. A visual inspection suggests a possible rotation or reflection. The colors themselves are maintained; it's their positions that change.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Alternatively, the transformation can be interpreted as reflecting the grid along the diagonal going from top-left to bottom right, and subsequently reflecting it across the central vertical axis. The simpler explanation will be utilized for future work.\n\n1.  **Rotate:** Take the input grid and rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. Each element moves to its new position based on this rotation.\n\n"
