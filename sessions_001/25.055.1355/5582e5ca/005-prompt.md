Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to identify the last non-zero color present in the input grid, reading from top-left to bottom-right, and create an output grid of the same dimensions where all pixels are of that color.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms an input grid into an output grid of the same dimensions,
    where all pixels in the output grid have the last non-zero color value
    found in the input grid (reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
    """
    # Initialize output_grid with the same dimensions as the input_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Find the last non-zero color
    target_color = 0
    for row in input_grid:
        for pixel in row:
            if pixel != 0:
                target_color = pixel

    # Fill the output_grid with the target color
    output_grid[:] = target_color

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
