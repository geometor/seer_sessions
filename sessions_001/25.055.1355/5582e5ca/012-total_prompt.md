    """
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)

    # Replace all cells in the output grid with the value 9 (maroon).
    output_grid[:] = 9

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward, incorporating the results from all training examples:

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (replace all cells with maroon) was too simplistic. While it worked for the first training example, it failed on subsequent examples. This indicates that the transformation rule is more complex and likely involves conditions or specific object identification rather than a blanket replacement. The consistent output size matching the input size is a valuable clue. The failures show us the rule *isn't* simply "make everything maroon," so we need to look for patterns in *what* becomes maroon and *why*.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** We need to meticulously examine each input-output pair, focusing on:
    *   What objects are present in the input?
    *   How do those objects relate to each other (position, color, size)?
    *   Which parts of the input change in the output, and which remain the same?
    *   Are there any consistent patterns across *all* examples?

2.  **Object Identification:**  The concept of "objectness" is key here.  We need to define what constitutes an "object" in each input grid.  Is it a contiguous block of the same color?  Are there multiple objects?

3.  **Conditional Logic:** The transformation likely involves conditions.  For example, "IF a pixel is part of object X, THEN change it to maroon, OTHERWISE leave it unchanged."

4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll start with a simple rule based on the most obvious patterns, test it, and then refine it based on the errors.

**Metrics and Reports (via Code Execution):**

I need to use the `code_execution` tool to analyze the provided examples and their results. Here are some initial metrics, I will refine with more code execution:
*   Input grid sizes.
*   Output grid sizes.
*   Number of unique colors in the input.
*   Number of unique colors in the output.
*   Pixel-by-pixel comparison of input and output to identify changes.
* counts of objects, colors, and sizes

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    """Analyzes a single input-output pair and returns metrics."""
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)

    input_colors = np.unique(input_grid)
    output_colors = np.unique(output_grid)

    diff = input_grid != output_grid
    changed_pixels = np.sum(diff)

    return {
        "input_shape": input_grid.shape,
        "output_shape": output_grid.shape,
        "input_colors": input_colors.tolist(),
        "output_colors": output_colors.tolist(),
        "changed_pixels": int(changed_pixels),
    }

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
- task_id: "7b601054" # Replace with the actual task ID
- observations:
  - example_1:
    - input:
      - object_1:
        - color: gray
        - shape: rectangle
        - size: 10x10
    - output:
      - object_1:
        - color: maroon
        - shape: rectangle
        - size: 10x10

      - object_2:
        - color: azure
        - shape: rectangle
        - size: 11x1

      - output:
        - object_1:
          - color: maroon
          - shape: rectangle
          - size: 9x9
- conclusions:
  - The input and output grids always have the same dimensions.
  -  A rectangle of a single color, filling the entire input, is transformed to maroon.
  - In example 2, the azure border is transformed to maroon, and the interior white remains unchanged.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule identifies the outer "frame" or "border" of the input grid and changes it to maroon (9). If the entire input grid is a single-color rectangle, the entire grid is considered the border and becomes maroon. If there's an inner area of a different color (as in Example 2), only the outermost layer of pixels of uniform color is transformed to maroon.

Another way to describe it, and the way I will implement in code, is:
Identify all single-color rectangles in the input. Transform the outermost rectangle to maroon.

This revised description accounts for all three training examples, including the case where the "border" is the entire image.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
