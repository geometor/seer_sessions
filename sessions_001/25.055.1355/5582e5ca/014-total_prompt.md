## Example 3

**input:**
```
4 6 9
6 4 1
8 8 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF1061D0>

**output:**
```
6 6 6
6 6 6
6 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF212380>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, structured facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception:**

The input is a 3x3 grid of colored squares, each with a single digit. The output is also a 3x3 grid, but all squares are the same color (magenta, represented by the digit 6). The key seems to be identifying a specific color/digit within the input grid that dictates the output grid's uniform color. In this example, the digit 6 (magenta) is present in multiple locations in the input.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: colored squares with digits
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: all squares are the same color
  - type: color_digit_mapping
    value_6: magenta
  - type: observation
    description: The output grid's color corresponds to one of the digits/colors present in the input grid.
  - type: observation
    description: input grid contains digit 6
    count: 3
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Color:** Examine the input grid and determine the most frequent color, represented by the color code integer.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid (3x3).
3.  **Fill Output Grid:** Fill every cell of the output grid with the integer representing the target color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
