Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for moving forward:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed with a very specific, limited understanding of the transformation, derived likely from only the first training example. It focuses on identifying a single non-zero pixel in the input and attempts to correlate it with multiple non-zero pixels in the output.  The provided code execution output shows this strategy works to some degree, by accident and it's not generalizable. The dimensions and the values in the output do not have a clear, reliable relationship with input.

The core issue is that the initial approach is far too simplistic.  It needs to shift from focusing on single pixels to recognizing *patterns* and *spatial relationships*.  The varying output grid sizes are a crucial clue. The provided examples vary in structure and dimension, that information must inform the updated natural program. The concept of identifying a single input object may still hold, but we need to consider that object's position relative to edges, corners, and any other object. It needs a method of creating a new shape, not simply using the old shape.

The strategy should involve these key steps:

1.  **Object Identification (Improved):**  Instead of just finding *a* non-zero pixel, the code needs to identify *all* distinct objects (contiguous blocks of the same color).  This likely involves a flood-fill or connected-component labeling algorithm. We're going to try and simplify and just find the non-zero values and then extract those shapes, if needed.
2.  **Relationship Analysis:**  For each identified object, analyze its properties:
    *   Color (value)
    *   Shape (bounding box or a more detailed representation)
    *   Position (centroid, or corner coordinates)
    *   *Relative* position to other objects (if any) and to the grid boundaries.
3.  **Transformation Rule Derivation:**  Look for *consistent* relationships between the input objects' properties and the output grid.  This is the hardest part. We'll need to consider:
    *   How the input object's color maps to the output colors. Is it a direct mapping, a calculation, or conditional?
    *   How the input object's position/shape influences the *output* shape and position.  Are there rotations, reflections, translations, or expansions/contractions involved?
    * How the presence and location of the output object changes with respect to the edges.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Test the derived rule on *all* examples.  If it fails, analyze the failures to refine the rule. This might involve adding conditions, considering additional properties, or rethinking the entire approach.

**Metrics and Observations (Code Execution)**

The provided code execution results are already quite useful.  Here's a more structured interpretation:

```
Example 1:
  Input: 3x3 grid, single 'red' (2) pixel at (1,1)
  Output: 3x3 grid, 'green' (3) at (0,0), 'magenta' (6) at (0,2), 'azure' (8) at (2,0), 'orange' (7) at (2,2)
  Analysis:  The output forms a cross shape of new colors in the corners of the grid.

Example 2:
  Input: 3x3 grid, single 'orange' (7) pixel at (1,1)
  Output: 4x4 grid, 'yellow' (4) at (2,0), 'gray' (5) at (2,2)
  Analysis: The output grid is larger and a diagonal of two new colors extends down and left from the center.

Example 3:
  Input: 4x4 grid, single 'yellow' (4) pixel at (1,2)
  Output: 4x4 grid, 'orange' (7) at (2,1), 'red' (2) at (2,3)
  Analysis: Output grid maintains the same dimensions. A horizontal line of two new colors forms one below the input color.

```

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  example_1:
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        value: 2
        position: (1, 1)  # Center
    output_objects:
      - color: green
        value: 3
        position: (0, 0)  # Top-left corner
      - color: magenta
        value: 6
        position: (0, 2)  # Top-right corner
      - color: azure
        value: 8
        position: (2, 0)  # Bottom-left corner
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        position: (2, 2)  # Bottom-right corner
    transformation:
      type: corner_cross
      output_size: same
      notes: Input object appears to generate four new objects at the corners.
  example_2:
    input_objects:
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        position: (1, 1)  # Center
    output_objects:
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
        position: (2, 0)
      - color: gray
        value: 5
        position: (2, 2)
    transformation:
      type: diagonal_expansion
      output_size: larger
      notes: Output grid expands, with two new colors appearing diagonally to the left and down one row.
  example_3:
    input_objects:
      - color: yellow
        value: 4
        position: (1, 2)
    output_objects:
      - color: orange
        value: 7
        position: (2, 1)
      - color: red
        value: 2
        position: (2, 3)
    transformation:
      type: horizontal_line
      output_size: same
      notes:  Output grid same size, new objects placed horizontally one row below input, mirroring input position.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Input Object:** Find the single non-zero pixel within the input grid.  Record its color and position.
2. **Determine the transformation rule:**
    *   **Example 1**: If the input is a 3x3 grid and contains one object: Create a 3x3 output. The output should contain four pixels, one in each corner. Use the colors green (0,0), magenta (0,2), azure (2,0) and orange (2,2) regardless of the original color.
    * **Example 2**: If the input is a 3x3 grid, and contains one object in position (1, 1): Create a 4x4 output grid. Place a yellow pixel (4) one row and column below the original position, and left one pixel, and a gray pixel (5) one row and column below the original position, and right one.
    *  **Example 3**: If the input is a 4x4 grid, and contains one object: Create a 4x4 output grid. Place an orange pixel (7) one row down and one column to the left of the location of the original color and a red pixel (2) one row down and one column to the right of the original object.
3.  **Output:** Generate the new grid based on the rule chosen in step 2.

This natural language program is significantly more detailed and attempts to account for the variations seen across the examples. It still describes three distinct rules, however.  A key next step will be to try and generalize these rules into a single, unified rule, or at the very least, to find clear criteria for choosing *between* the rules based on input properties. This will almost certainly involve looking at more training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
