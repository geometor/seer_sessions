## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 2 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7DCBFF212380>

**output:**
```
0 0 3 0 6
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 8 0 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CB280>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are 3x5 (rows x columns). The input grid contains a single non-zero pixel (colored red, value 2) located at (1, 3) - row 1, column 3 (using 0-indexing). The output grid contains four non-zero pixels, all with different colors and values, and all located on the edges of the grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: [3, 5]
    elements:
      - value: 2
        color: red
        position: [1, 3]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        position: all_other_cells

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: [3, 5]
    elements:
      - value: 3
        color: green
        position: [0, 2]
      - value: 6
        color: magenta
        position: [0, 4]
      - value: 8
        color: azure
        position: [2, 2]
      - value: 7
        color: orange
        position: [2, 4]
      - value: 0
        color: white
        position: all_other_cells

  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: "Place colored numbers based on the location of red pixel in input grid"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Key Pixel:** Locate the single red pixel (value 2) in the input grid.
2. **Determine relative positions:** four new values will be created in the output grid relative to that red position
3.  **Create new pixels:** based on the position of the red pixel (r, c):
    *   A green pixel (value 3) is placed at position (r-1, c-1), one above and one to the left.
    *   A magenta pixel (value 6) is placed at (r-1, c+1), one above and one to the right
    *    An azure pixel (value 8) is placed at (r+1, c-1), one below and to the left.
    *    An orange pixel (value 7) is placed at (r+1, c+1), one below and to the right.
4.  **Fill Remaining Pixels:** All other cells in the output grid remain white (value 0).

In essence, the red pixel in the input grid acts as an anchor point. Four new pixels of different colors are generated around the anchor point.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
