    description: >
       The green pixel is created in the output based on a calculation
       relative to position of the red pixel from the input.
  - transformation:
      - condition: red pixel exists in input
        action: determine position for green pixel
        details: >
          Green pixel is created by an offset of red pixel location.
          Sometimes one up, one left. Sometimes one down, one right.
          Sometimes one up and one right, sometimes one up and one left.
          Calculate dx, dy by (input_red_x - output_green_x) and (input_red_y - output_green_y)
