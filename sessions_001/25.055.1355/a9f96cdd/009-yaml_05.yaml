observations:
  - object: red_pixel
    color: red
    value: 2
    initial_presence: always_present # in input
    final_presence: always_absent # in output
    notes: "The red pixel in the input is replaced by a green pixel in the output."

  - object: green_pixel
    color: green
    value: 3
    initial_presence: always_absent #in input
    final_presence: always_present # in output
    notes: "The green pixel appears in a location relative to the red pixel's initial position."

  - object: background
    color: white
    value: 0
    notes: "The rest of the grid is filled with white pixels."

  - relative_position:
      object1: green_pixel
      object2: red_pixel
      relationship: varies # adjacent
      x_diff: [-1, 1]  # Green can be left or right of red
      y_diff: [-1, 1] # Green can be above or below red
      notes: "The green pixel's position is always cardinally adjacent to where the red pixel was."
