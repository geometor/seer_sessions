## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0
0 2 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7DCBFF212680>

**output:**
```
3 0 6 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
8 0 7 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7DCBFC2DE170>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by single-digit integers) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid appears to have a single non-zero (colored) pixel, while the output grid has multiple non-zero pixels. The positions and colors of the output pixels seem unrelated to the position and color of the input pixel, in a direct, obvious sense. It seems to be an encoding or a symbolic transformation rather than a geometric or arithmetic one.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x5
    elements: pixels
    values: integers 0-9
    color_map:
      0: white
      2: red
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 3x5
    elements: pixels
    values: integers 0-9
     color_map:
      0: white
      3: green
      6: magenta
      7: orange
      8: azure
  - observation: input_single_color
    description: The input grid contains only one non-zero pixel.
  - observation: output_multiple_colors
    description: The output grid contains multiple non-zero pixels.
  - observation: no_spatial_correlation
    description: The location of the non-zero input pixel does not directly correspond to the locations of the non-zero output pixels.
  - hypothesis: symbolic_transformation
      description: The transformation is likely a symbolic mapping based on the input non-zero value and/or it's position in the grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input:** Examine the input grid and find the single non-zero pixel. Note its value (color).
2.  **Lookup Transformation:** Based on the value, perform a predefined symbolic mapping. This mapping dictates the values and positions of multiple pixels within the output grid. Based on the one input-output example, the red pixel (value 2) is mapped to the constant output shown. It is likely that other color inputs would map to unique, consistent output patterns.
3.  **Create Output:** Construct the output grid, populating specified cells with values based on the map, and setting any undefined locations in the output map to be 0.

Essentially, the transformation appears to function like a lookup table or a very small case statement (switch-case) where the input value determines the entire output grid configuration. More examples would be needed to clarify the mapping rules for all possible input values.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
