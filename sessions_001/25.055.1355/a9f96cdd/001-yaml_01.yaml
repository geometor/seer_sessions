  - observation: input_single_color
    description: The input grid contains only one non-zero pixel.
  - observation: output_multiple_colors
    description: The output grid contains multiple non-zero pixels.
  - observation: no_spatial_correlation
    description: The location of the non-zero input pixel does not directly correspond to the locations of the non-zero output pixels.
  - hypothesis: symbolic_transformation
      description: The transformation is likely a symbolic mapping based on the input non-zero value and/or it's position in the grid.
