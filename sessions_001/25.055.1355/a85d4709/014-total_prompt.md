## Example 3

**input:**
```
5 0 0
0 5 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2DFDC0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
4 4 4
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2DCCD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains gray (5) and white (0) pixels, while the output grid contains red (2) and yellow (4) pixels. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x3). The key seems to be the replacement of specific colors based on their initial position or surrounding context.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is 3x3 and contains pixels of color 5 (gray) and 0 (white).
  - observation: |
      The output grid is 3x3 and contains pixels of color 2 (red) and 4 (yellow).
  - observation: |
      The gray pixels (5) in the input are replaced.
  - observation: |
      The white pixels (0) in the input are replaced.
  - relationship: |
      The central gray pixel is changed to yellow (4).
   - relationship: |
       Other gray pixels in the corner is changed to red (2).
  - relationship: |
      All white pixels are changed to red (2).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Check** if a gray pixel is located at the center of the grid (row 1, column 1 - if we were zero indexing the rows and columns. That corresponds to the second row and second column).
3.  **If** it is the central pixel, **replace** it with a yellow (4) pixel.
4.    **If** it not the centeral pixel, **replace** all other gray pixels with red (2)
5.  **Identify** all white (0) pixels.
6.  **Replace** all white pixels with red (2).

Essentially, this describes a conditional color replacement: gray becomes yellow if in the center and red otherwise, while all white becomes red.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
