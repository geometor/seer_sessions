## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 0 5
0 0 5
0 0 5
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CA740>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
3 3 3
3 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CAD40>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of single-digit integers. The input grid contains the values 0 and 5, representing white and gray, respectively. The output grid contains only the value 3, representing green. The dimensions of the grid (3x3) remain constant between input and output. The key transformation seems to be a replacement of all values with the value 3.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid is a 3x3 matrix.
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains values 0 (white) and 5 (gray).
  - observation: |
      The output grid is a 3x3 matrix.
  - observation: |
      The output grid contains only the value 3 (green).
  - observation: |
     The dimensions of the grids in input and output are identical.
  - relationship: |
      All original cell values in the input grid are replaced by 3 in the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the given input grid.
2.  **Replacement:** Iterate through every cell in the input grid. Replace the existing value of each cell with the value 3.
3.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output. In simple terms: Change all pixels to green.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
