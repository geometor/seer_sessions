            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on a simple value mapping observed in the first training example. The results on the subsequent examples reveal that the transformation is indeed a simple value mapping, but the initial mapping inferred was incorrect. The strategy is to correct the mapping based on *all* provided training examples, rather than generalizing from just the first. This means, the structure of the provided python code is good and will perform well after correcting the specific pixel value mappings.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, including the predicted output and a comparison with the expected output. I am focused on the pixel value mappings:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[3, 3, 3], [3, 4, 3], [3, 3, 3]]`\n    *   Observed Mapping: 0 -> 3, 5 -> 4\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[5, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 5]]`\n    *   Expected Output: `[[4, 4, 4], [4, 3, 4], [4, 4, 4]]`\n        *   Observed Mapping: 5 -> 4, 0 -> 3\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n      *   Input: `[[0, 5, 0], [5, 0, 5], [0, 5, 0]]`\n      *   Expected Output: `[[3, 4, 3], [4, 3, 4], [3, 4, 3]]`\n          *   Observed Mapping: 0 -> 3, 5 -> 4\n\nAll examples confirm the same mapping. There are no other values other than 0 and 5 in any input grids, therefore no other mapping is necessary at the moment.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\ntask: value_mapping\nobjects:\n  - description: input grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - values: integers (0-9)\n  - description: output grid\n    properties:\n      - type: 2D array\n      - values: integers (0-9)\nactions:\n  - description: value mapping\n    details:\n      - map: 0 to 3\n      - map: 5 to 4\n      - map: all other input values to themselves, implicitly, though none are present in these inputs.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Begin with an input grid of arbitrary size.\n2.  **Value Mapping:** Iterate through each pixel in the input grid.\n    *   If a pixel's value is 0, change it to 3 (green).\n    *   If a pixel's value is 5, change it to 4 (yellow).\n    *   All other pixel values remain unchanged.\n3.  **Output:** The modified grid becomes the output grid.\n"
