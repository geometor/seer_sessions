## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 5 0
0 0 5
0 5 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B7460>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
3 3 3
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B56C0>
Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed natural language program for the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input Grid:** A 3x3 grid containing two colors: white (0) and gray (5).
*   **Output Grid:** A 3x3 grid containing two different colors: yellow (4) and green (3).
*   **Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve a color change based on the original color and potentially its position or neighbors. It seems to replace every non-zero color with 3, and others with 4.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 5
        color: gray
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 4
        color: yellow
      - value: 3
        color: green
  - action: color_transformation
    description: Changes colors based on original value.
    rule:
        if input_color is gray, output_color is green;
        if input_color is white, output_color is yellow
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2.  If the cell's color is gray (5), change it to green (3) in the output grid.
3. if the cell's color is white(0), change it to yellow(4) in the output grid.
4.  Maintain the grid's 3x3 dimensions.

Essentially the input's non-zero pixels will map to 3 and zero pixels to 4.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
