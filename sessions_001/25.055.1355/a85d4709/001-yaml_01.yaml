facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are both 3x3.
  - observation: |
      The positions of the pixels remain constant between input and output.
  - observation: |
     Input grid contains values '0' and '5'
  - observation: |
      The transformation involves changing pixel values (colors).
  - observation: |
      Output grid contains values '2', '3', and '4'.
  - mapping_rule: |
    '0' in the input maps to a '3' in the output.
  - mapping_rule: |
    '5' in the input maps to '4' in the output.
  - observation: |
      The mapping is consistent across the entire grid.
