## Example 2

**input:**
```
0 2 0
7 0 8
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D7B0>

**output:**
```
0 2 0
7 2 8
7 2 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The input grid transforms into an output grid. The colors are represented by integers 0-9. The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), orange (7), and azure (8). The transformation seems to involve replicating a row. The input has three distinct rows while output has two identical rows at the bottom. The middle element of center row in the input is the same as middle element of the top row.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Output is a 3x3 grid.
  - observation: Input grid contains colors 0, 2, 7, and 8.
  - observation: Output grid contains colors 0, 2, 7, and 8.
  - observation: The top row of the input grid is identical to the top row of the output grid.
  - observation: The bottom two rows are identical and equal the central row except the central pixel
  - observation: Middle pixel of row 2, and row 3 has the same value
  - object: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)
    actions:
      - row_replication: The second row of input is almost copied
  - object: row
    properties:
      - position: top, middle, bottom
  - relationship: The center value of input row 2 is the same as the center value of row 1
  - relationship: All the elements of row 2 and row 3 of output, other than the center value are the same as in input.
  - relationship: The center value of rows 2 and row 3 are the same as the center value of row 1.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Copy the top row of the input grid to the top row of the output grid.
2.  Copy the second row of the input to the second row of the output grid
3.  Change the central pixel of the second row of the output to match the central pixel of the first row
4. Copy the second row of the output grid to third row of the output grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
