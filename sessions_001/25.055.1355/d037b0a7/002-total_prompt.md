## Example 1

**input:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 0
3 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DA410>

**output:**
```
0 0 6
0 4 6
3 4 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF5DB670>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color. The input grid transforms into the output grid, suggesting a rule-based modification of the grid's contents. The most obvious change is that some of the '0' (white) cells in the input are replaced by other colors in the output. Specifically, the white cells in the bottom right 2x2 subgrid are replaced, with magenta (6) filling the cells originally not present.

**YAML Fact Block:**

              condition: originally 4
            - value: 3
              condition: originally 3
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the 2x2 subgrid**: Locate the 2x2 subgrid at the bottom right corner of the input grid.
2.  **Check colors**: The colors present in the output bottom right are derived from colors on the input edges that are not white (0).
3. **Fill Subgrid**: Fill this 2x2 subgrid such that, replace any 0 (white) with the color to its right, top, top right.
4. The top left cell of the grid is untouched.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
