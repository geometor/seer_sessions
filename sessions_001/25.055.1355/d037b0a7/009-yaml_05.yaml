example_1:
  input_shape: [3, 3]
  output_shape: [3, 3]
  top_row_colors: [blue, yellow, blue]
  second_row_colors: [green, green, green]
  transformation: "Second row's center pixel changes to first row's center pixel.  Modified second row is copied to third row."

example_2:
  input_shape: [5, 5]
  output_shape: [5, 5]
  top_row_colors: [blue, yellow, blue, yellow, blue]
  second_row_colors: [green, green, green, green, green]
  transformation: "Second row's center pixel changes to first row's center pixel. Modified second row is copied to third row."

example_3:
  input_shape: [7, 7]
  output_shape: [7, 7]
  top_row_colors: [blue, yellow, blue, yellow, blue, yellow, blue]
  second_row_colors: [green, green, green, green, green, green, green]
  transformation: "Second row's center pixel changes to first row's center pixel.  Modified second row is copied to third row."

general_observations:
  - The first row of the input grid is copied to the first row of the output grid.
  - The second row of the input grid is mostly copied to the second row of the output grid, with an alteration.
  - The central pixel (or pixels for even width grids) color of the output grid's second row is replaced with the color of the central pixel(s) of the first row.
  - The modified second row of the output grid is duplicated as the third row.
  - All rows beyond the third row are black/empty/zero.
  - Grid height can vary
  - Grid width can vary and appears to always be an odd number.
