The input grid contains yellow (4), red (2), and white (0) pixels. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, with some pixels retaining their original colors and positions, while others change. The most notable change is the replication of colored pixels downwards.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
