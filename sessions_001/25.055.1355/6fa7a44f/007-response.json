The input grid appears to be transformed into a larger output grid. The transformation seems to involve a reflection or mirroring of the input grid. The colors and their spatial arrangement are preserved in the transformation, with the output being a vertically mirrored and concatenated version of the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

This means flipping the input grid along the horizontal axis. Row 1 becomes Row 3, Row 3 becomes Row 1.\n3.  **Concatenate:** Append the mirrored copy to the bottom of the original input grid.\n4. **Output:** Return new grid. The new grid has twice the height and same width as the original input grid.\n\nEssentially, the program takes the input grid, flips it vertically, and then stacks the flipped version below the original.\n"
