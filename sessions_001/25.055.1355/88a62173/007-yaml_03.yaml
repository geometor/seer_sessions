  - relationship: transformation
    type: spatial_extraction
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid based on a specific rule related to the positions of the '1' values.
    details: >
      The transformation focuses on extracting specific '1' values from the input grid and
      forming a new, smaller grid. The relative positioning, perhaps within blocks or using
      specific coordinates, seems to be the key.
