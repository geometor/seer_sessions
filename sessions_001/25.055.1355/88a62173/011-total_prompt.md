Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Clusters:** Examine the input grid and identify distinct clusters of blue (1) pixels. A cluster is defined as a group of blue pixels connected orthogonally (not diagonally).

2.  **Simplify each Cluster:** For each cluster, select the blue pixels that compose the diagonal from the top-left to bottom-right of the smallest bounding box that contains the entire cluster.

3. **Arrange Output:** Create an output grid. Maintain the relative positioning of the simplified representations of each input cluster. That is, if cluster A's simplified form is to the left of cluster B's simplified form in the input, the same relative positioning should hold in the output. If a cluster simplifies to an empty set of pixels, it does not appear in the output. The overall size and spacing of output simplifies to the minimal bounding box needed.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
