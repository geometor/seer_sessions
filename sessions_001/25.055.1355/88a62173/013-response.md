Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller grid. The colors present in this specific example are azure (8) and white (0). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern, although it's not perfectly consistent. The output grid seems to extract a representative subset of the input grid, preserving the relative positions of the colors. The dimensions of the input grid are 5x5, and the output grid is 2x2.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 5x5, output grid is 2x2.
  - objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: 5x5 (input)
        - dimensions: 2x2 (output)
        - cells: pixels with color values
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: azure (8)
        - color: white (0)
  - actions:
      - type: extraction
        description: A 2x2 subgrid is extracted from the input grid.
      - type: representation
        description: keep colors and positions
  - relationships:
    - spatial: Input grid pixels have corresponding positions in the output grid, maintaining relative arrangement.
    - size: Output grid is smaller than input grid.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the top-left 2x2 sub-grid of non-white pixels:**
2.  **Extract the values** Scan the first azure (8) cells. First move to the right on that row, then down.



```
8 8
8 0
```



3. **Reverse the extracted 2x2 grid and output it**:



```
0 8
8 0
```
