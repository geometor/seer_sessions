## Example 3

**input:**
```
8 8 0 0 8
8 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0
8 8 0 8 8
8 0 0 8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x320 at 0x7DCBFF46E320>

**output:**
```
0 8
8 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=128x128 at 0x7DCBFF46D9F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers) into a smaller grid. The colors present in this specific example are azure (8) and white (0). The input grid appears to have a checkerboard-like pattern, although it's not perfectly consistent. The output grid seems to extract a representative subset of the input grid, preserving the relative positions of the colors. The dimensions of the input grid are 5x5, and the output grid is 2x2.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 5x5, output grid is 2x2.
  - objects:
    - type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: 5x5 (input)
        - dimensions: 2x2 (output)
        - cells: pixels with color values
    - type: pixel
      properties:
        - color: azure (8)
        - color: white (0)
  - actions:
      - type: extraction
        description: A 2x2 subgrid is extracted from the input grid.
      - type: representation
        description: keep colors and positions
  - relationships:
    - spatial: Input grid pixels have corresponding positions in the output grid, maintaining relative arrangement.
    - size: Output grid is smaller than input grid.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the top-left 2x2 sub-grid of non-white pixels:**
2.  **Extract the values** Scan the first azure (8) cells. First move to the right on that row, then down.


```
8 8
8 0
```


3. **Reverse the extracted 2x2 grid and output it**:


```
0 8
8 0
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
