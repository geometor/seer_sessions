## Example 1

**input:**
```
6 6 7 6
6 6 7 7
7 7 6 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B4430>

**output:**
```
2 2 7 2
2 2 7 7
7 7 2 7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7DCBFC2B6BF0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to be transformed into an output grid of the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a color change: magenta (6) pixels become red (2), while orange (7) pixels remain unchanged. The spatial arrangement of the pixels is preserved.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are grids of the same dimensions.
  - type: object
    description: Pixels are the objects, defined by their color and position.
  - type: color_property
    magenta: 6
    red: 2
    orange: 7
  - type: transformation
    description: Color change while maintaining spatial arrangement.
    rule:
      - if color is magenta (6), change to red (2)
      - if color is orange (7), keep as orange (7)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Check** the color of the current pixel.
3.  **If** the color is magenta (6), **change** it to red (2) in the output grid.
4.  **If** the color is orange (7), **keep** it as orange (7) in the output grid.
5. **Maintain** the original position of each pixel within output grid. The row and column of the pixel does not change during the transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
