The input grid contains pixels of two colors: red (2) and white (0). The output grid is identical to the input grid, except some white pixels have become blue (1). It seems like the transformation focuses on changing a subset of white pixels to blue. The position of the blue pixels in the output seems to be related to the location of the red pixels.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note, in the example, there is also a case with no diagonal adjacency to red, it is directly down.\n3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of those identified white pixels to blue (value 1).\n4.  **Preserve Other:** All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule is to change the color of diagonally adjacent white pixels (and directly down in one case) of any red pixels to blue, while keeping all other pixels the same.\n"
