  - object: red_pixels
    description: Pixels with color value 2. These pixels remain unchanged.
    properties:
      color: red
      change: static
  - object: white_pixels
    description: Pixels with color value 0.
    properties:
      color: white
      change: dynamic
  - object: blue_pixels
    description: Originate as white pixels. Some become blue if they are adjacent to a red pixel and form a continuous horizontal or vertical path with other white pixels.
    properties:
      color: blue
      change: conditional
  - action: preserve_red
    description: All red pixels in the input grid are copied to the output grid without changes.
  - action: transform_white
    description: Certain white pixels become blue. A white pixel turns blue if it's directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to at least one red pixel, or if it's adjacent to another white pixel which will become blue.
  - constraint: adjacent_path
    description: The white pixels become blue if they create a continuous line or block of pixels that connects with another blue or red pixel.
