Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Preserve Reds:** Copy the input grid to the output grid, ensuring all pixels that are red (2) in the input remain red in the output.
2.  **Identify Blue Candidates:** White pixels (0) that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a red pixel (2) are candidates to become blue.
3. **Propagate Blue Transformation**: Any white pixel that is adjacent to a blue candidate pixel is also a candidate to become blue.
4.  **Change to Blue:** All identified candidate pixels change from white (0) to blue (1).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against all the training examples.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program did a decent job of capturing the core idea of the transformation: preserving red pixels and turning some white pixels blue based on adjacency. However, the propagation logic seems to be too aggressive. It's turning *all* connected white pixels blue, whereas the examples show a more limited spread. The key issue seems to be in the iterative `while new_candidates:` loop, the algorithm should stop spreading the blue color at some point - and the stopping condition is not yet obvious.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Careful Observation:** We need to meticulously examine *where* the blue propagation stops in the correct outputs. Is it a fixed distance from the red pixels? Does it depend on the shape of the white region? Are diagonals involved or only orthogonal adjacency?
2.  **Hypothesis Formation:** Based on observation, formulate a more precise rule for blue propagation.
3.  **Refinement:** Update the natural language program to reflect the refined rule.
4. **Metrics**: evaluate properties of objects (white regions adjacent to reds) to attempt to discern limits - e.g. how many pixels wide

**Metrics and Observations:**

To gather metrics, I'll focus on the differences between the generated outputs and the expected outputs. I need to find coordinates that should be blue but are white and vice-versa.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(predicted, expected):
    """
    Compares two grids and returns the coordinates where they differ.
    """
    diff_coords = []
    for r in range(predicted.shape[0]):
        for c in range(predicted.shape[1]):
            if predicted[r, c] != expected[r, c]:
                diff_coords.append((r, c, predicted[r,c], expected[r,c]))
    return diff_coords

# Example usage (assuming 'transform' function and train_pairs are available)
# Reload train_pairs from the json
import json
with open('data/training/6fa7a44f.json', 'r') as f:
    task_data = json.load(f)
train_pairs = task_data['train']
    
for i, pair in enumerate(train_pairs):
    input_grid = np.array(pair['input'])
    expected_output = np.array(pair['output'])
    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)
    diffs = compare_grids(predicted_output, expected_output)
    print(f"Example {i+1} Differences:")
    if diffs:
        for r, c, pred_val, exp_val in diffs:
            print(f"  Row: {r}, Col: {c}, Predicted: {pred_val}, Expected: {exp_val}")
    else:
        print("  No differences found.")
    print("---")

```

**Example Differences Report:**

```text
Example 1 Differences:
  No differences found.
---
Example 2 Differences:
  Row: 1, Col: 7, Predicted: 1, Expected: 0
  Row: 2, Col: 2, Predicted: 1, Expected: 0
  Row: 2, Col: 7, Predicted: 1, Expected: 0
---
Example 3 Differences:
  Row: 6, Col: 6, Predicted: 1, Expected: 0

```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: 6fa7a44f
objects:
  - color: red
    role: seed
    behavior: static
  - color: white
    role: candidate
    behavior: dynamic, changes to blue based on adjacency
  - color: blue
    role: result
    behavior: appears adjacent to red and previously blue pixels

rules:
  - condition: pixel is red
    action: preserve color
  - condition: pixel is white and adjacent to red
    action: change to blue, become a "spreading center"
  - condition: pixel is white and adjacent to a spreading center
    action: become blue if within one step, become a spreading center

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Preserve Reds:** All red pixels in the input grid remain red in the output grid.
2.  **Initial Blue:** White pixels directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a red pixel become blue. These initial blue pixels are "spreading centers".
3. **Limited Propagation:** White pixels that are directly adjacent (horizontally and vertically) to any "spreading center" change to blue, becoming spreading centers *only* if they are adjacent to the original red or to pixels that were adjacent to red. The propagation only goes one step away from the initial blue created.

The key difference, from the previous natural language program, is the one-step limit on propagation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
