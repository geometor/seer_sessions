            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program and observations accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding code were a good first attempt, focusing on preserving red pixels and changing some white pixels to blue based on adjacency. However, the test results across multiple training examples show that the logic for determining *which* white pixels to transform is incomplete or incorrect. The initial assumption about \"bottom-right most\" white pixels is not universally applicable. We need to identify a more general rule that considers all training examples. The code logic is almost correct, but the determination of a candidate is not sufficient.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Mismatches:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output for each training example where the code failed. Focus on *why* specific white pixels were changed to blue in the expected output, but not in the actual output (or vice versa).\n2.  **Identify Common Patterns:** Look for common characteristics or relationships among the white pixels that are changed to blue in *all* successful examples, and those that are different from examples that are not successful.\n3.  **Refine the Rule:** Based on the pattern analysis, revise the natural language program to accurately describe the conditions under which a white pixel becomes blue. It may involve concepts like:\n    *   Connectivity: Are the changed white pixels part of a continuous \"path\" or \"region\" connected to the red pixels?\n    *   Directionality: Is there a consistent direction (e.g., only to the right and down of red pixels)?\n    *   Completeness: Does the transformation \"fill in\" certain areas or shapes?\n4. **Update YAML facts**\n\n**Metrics and Example Analysis (using hypothetical code execution results - replaced with actual analysis below):**\n\nSince I don't have code execution capabilities in this environment, the following analyses assume comparison by visual inspection, I would normally execute code to verify the analysis and generate metrics, but I will proceed by manually analyzing the results.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct) - Provides the base case.\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect) - the code changes pixels to blue correctly, but it fails to change some of the pixels that should be changed.\n*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect) - the code changes pixels to blue correctly, but it fails to change some of the pixels that should be changed.\n\n**Revised YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object: red_pixels\n    description: Pixels with color value 2. These pixels remain unchanged.\n    properties:\n      color: red\n      change: static\n  - object: white_pixels\n    description: Pixels with color value 0.\n    properties:\n      color: white\n      change: dynamic\n  - object: blue_pixels\n    description: Originate as white pixels. Some become blue if they are adjacent to a red pixel and form a continuous horizontal or vertical path with other white pixels.\n    properties:\n      color: blue\n      change: conditional\n  - action: preserve_red\n    description: All red pixels in the input grid are copied to the output grid without changes.\n  - action: transform_white\n    description: Certain white pixels become blue. A white pixel turns blue if it's directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to at least one red pixel, or if it's adjacent to another white pixel which will become blue.\n  - constraint: adjacent_path\n    description: The white pixels become blue if they create a continuous line or block of pixels that connects with another blue or red pixel.\n\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Preserve Reds:** Copy the input grid to the output grid, ensuring all pixels that are red (2) in the input remain red in the output.\n2.  **Identify Blue Candidates:** White pixels (0) that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a red pixel (2) are candidates to become blue.\n3. **Propagate Blue Transformation**: Any white pixel that is adjacent to a blue candidate pixel is also a candidate to become blue.\n4.  **Change to Blue:** All identified candidate pixels change from white (0) to blue (1).\n\nEssentially, the rule involves a \"flood fill\" or \"spreading\" of the blue color from the red pixels, horizontally and vertically only, through the white pixels. The original code almost had it, but missed the \"spreading\" or \"propagation\" aspect. It only changed the direct neighbors, it did not change the pixels next to the newly changed pixel.\n"
