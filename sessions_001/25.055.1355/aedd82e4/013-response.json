The primary colors observed are red (2) and white (0). The transformation seems to involve a very localized change: a single red pixel changes to blue (1). The location of this change is specific, targeting a red pixel that appears isolated among other colors within the grid.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
