## Example 4

**input:**
```
2 2 0
2 0 2
0 2 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC29BEB0>

**output:**
```
2 2 0
2 0 1
0 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC29B250>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, presented as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains pixels of two colors: red (2) and white (0). The output grid is identical to the input grid, except some white pixels have become blue (1). It seems like the transformation focuses on changing a subset of white pixels to blue. The position of the blue pixels in the output seems to be related to the location of the red pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [0, 1, 2]
          mapping:
            0: white
            1: blue
            2: red

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color
      - position (row, column)

actions:
  - name: change_color
    input: pixel
    parameters:
      - new_color
    output: pixel

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: pixels

observations:
  - input_grid contains only red and white pixels
  - output_grid is mostly identical to input grid, changing some white to blue
  - changed pixels seem related to original red pixel locations

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are red (value 2).
2.  **Identify White Neighbors:** Find all white pixels (value 0) in the input grid that are *diagonally adjacent* to any of the red pixels. Note, in the example, there is also a case with no diagonal adjacency to red, it is directly down.
3.  **Change Color:** Change the color of those identified white pixels to blue (value 1).
4.  **Preserve Other:** All other pixels remain unchanged.

Essentially, the transformation rule is to change the color of diagonally adjacent white pixels (and directly down in one case) of any red pixels to blue, while keeping all other pixels the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
