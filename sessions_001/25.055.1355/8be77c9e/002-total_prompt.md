## Example 1

**input:**
```
1 1 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF3CBB20>

**output:**
```
1 1 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
1 1 1
1 1 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x384 at 0x7DCBFF3CBAC0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each represented by a single digit (0 or 1 in this case). These digits correspond to colors (0: white, 1: blue). The input grid is transformed into a larger output grid. The transformation appears to involve some form of mirroring or reflection, and expansion of the original image.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: "Input is a 3x3 grid."
  - observation: "Output is a 6x3 grid."
  - observation: "Input grid contains only colors 0 (white) and 1 (blue)."
  - observation: "Output grid contains only colors 0 (white) and 1 (blue)."
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [0, 1]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x3
      - colors: [0, 1]
  - relationship: "Output grid appears to be a vertically mirrored and stacked version of the input grid."
  - action: "Vertical mirroring of the input grid."
  - action: "Stacking of the original input and its mirrored version."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Mirror:** Take the input grid and create a vertically mirrored copy. This means flipping the grid along the horizontal axis.
2.  **Stack:** Stack the original input grid on top and the mirrored copy on the bottom to form the output grid.

Essentially, the transformation duplicates the input grid by vertically mirroring it and placing the mirrored version below the original.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
