    output_grid = np.array([[1]])

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a strategy to refine the natural language program and the corresponding code.

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were overly simplistic. They were based on the first training example, leading to a function that always returns a 1x1 grid with the value 1 (blue). This approach failed on subsequent examples where the output is not a 1x1 blue grid. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis didn't capture the actual transformation logic, which is likely more complex and involves analyzing the input grid's properties.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze all examples:** We need to meticulously examine all input-output pairs in the training set to identify patterns and relationships. This involves looking at object features (size, color, position), spatial relationships, and potential operations (counting, mirroring, etc.).
2.  **Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes an "object" in the context of each example and the overall task.
3.  **Property Extraction:** Determine relevant properties of these objects, like color, size, shape, and location within the grid.
4.  **Relationship Mapping:** Analyze how input objects and their properties relate to the output objects and properties. Look for consistent transformations or rules.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Based on the analysis, iteratively update the natural language program and the Python code. We will go back and forth, testing the new code against all examples after each update.
6. **Report**: Provide a detailed report in the required format.

**Code Execution for Metrics:**

{'example_index': 3, 'input_shape': (5, 9), 'output_shape': (1, 1), 'predicted_output_shape': (1, 1), 'is_correct': False}

The simple transform was only correct on example 0 and incorrect on the others.

            - color: azure
              shape: rectangle
              size: [2,3]

                shape: rectangle
                size: [ 2, 3 ]
                position: [5, 6]
          description: A green rectangle on a white background.

        output:
          objects:
            - color: blue
              shape: rectangle
              size: [ 2, 6 ]

  - example_3:
        input:
            objects:
              - color: magenta
                shape: line # L shape
                size: [ 3, 3 ]
                position: [1, 3]
            description:  A magenta L shape in the center of the grid.
        output:
          objects:

              shape: single pixel
              size: [ 1, 1 ]
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** The input grid contains a single prominent object against a background of white (color 0). The object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color (not 0). The shape can vary (rectangle, L-shape, etc.).

2.  **Object Properties:** Note the color, shape, size (height and width), and position (top-left corner coordinates) of the object in the input grid.

3.  **Output Determination:**
    *   If the input object is yellow and forms rectangle of size 2x4, the output is a 1x1 grid with the value 1 (blue).
    *   If the input object is azure and forms a rectangle of size 2x3, the output is a 3x3 azure rectangle.
    *   If the input object is green with a size of 2 x 3, output a blue rectangle of size 2 x 6.
    *   If the input is a magenta L shape of size 3 x 3, the output is a gray 1x1 grid

4.  **General Rule Attempt (Incomplete):**
    The output grid's content is determined by the shape and color of the largest contiguous non-white object in the input grid.

    It appears there are a number of special case rules. We are likely missing
    one of more of the training cases to clarify these rules.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
