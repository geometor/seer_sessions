## Example 4

**input:**
```
0 0 0
2 0 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46D7B0>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFF46E320>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 1x1 grid. The input grid contains pixels of value 0 (white) and 2 (red). The output grid contains a single pixel of value 1 (blue). The task appears to involve counting or summarizing the input grid in some way. The red pixels seem important.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - subject: input_grid
    property: dimensions
    value: 3x3
    type: grid
  - subject: input_grid
    property: contains_color
    value: 0 (white)
    type: color
  - subject: input_grid
    property: contains_color
    value: 2 (red)
    type: color
  - subject: red_pixels
    relation: located_in
    object: input_grid
    count: 2
  - subject: output_grid
    property: dimensions
    value: 1x1
    type: grid
  - subject: output_grid
    property: contains_color
    value: 1 (blue)
    type: color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Count the number of red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.
2.  Create a 1x1 output grid.
3.  If the count of red pixels from step 1 is even, fill the 1x1 output grid with blue, otherwise fill the output grid with black. (in this case the count is 2, and we make a blue output)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
