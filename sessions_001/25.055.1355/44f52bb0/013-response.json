The output is a single digit '1', which corresponds to the color blue. It appears the transformation involves counting or evaluating specific elements within the input grid and representing the result with a single blue pixel. The transformation likely involves a reduction of the entire input grid into a single-pixel output. The most obvious pattern is counting something and then replacing everything with a single pixel of color blue representing the number.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Set the value of this single cell in output grid to the count obtained in step 1.\n4. Output has a value of 1 (blue), I suspect there is another example where input would yield a different value. If there are other examples that resulted in values other than 1, this could be a simplification.\n\nAlternative (based on a constant output value):\n\n1.  **Observe** the input grid (regardless of its content).\n2.  Create a 1x1 output grid.\n3. Set the value of single pixel to 1.\n4.   Output this value is represented by blue.\n\nIt is more likely the alternative program is correct, counting instances of '2' would return '6' which would not have a corresponding value of 1. It seems likely the next example might give some insight.\n"
