## Example 1

**input:**
```
2 0 2
0 2 0
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF111960>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFF3CAF50>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values, representing colors. The output is a single value within a 1x1 grid, also corresponding to a color. The specific colors involved are red (2) and white (0) in the input, and blue (1) in the output. The transformation seems to involve a reduction of the entire input grid into a single-pixel output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]
    properties:
      colors: [red, white, red, white, red, white, red, white, red]

  - type: grid
    dimensions: 1x1
    elements: [1]
    properties:
        colors: [blue]

actions:
  - type: count
    target: color
    value: red
    result: 4
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: input_to_output
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Count the number of red (value '2') pixels in the input grid.
2.  Create a 1x1 output grid.
3.  If number of reds is four, then the output pixel should be equal to 1.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
