## Example 5

**input:**
```
2 2 0
0 2 2
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFF46C160>

**output:**
```
7
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFF46D7B0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing numerical values representing colors. The output is a single numerical value, also representing a color. The primary colors involved seem to be red (2) and white (0) in the input, resulting in orange (7) in the output. It appears that a specific operation related to the non-zero color values in the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (representing colors)
  - type: integer
    role: output

properties:
  - color_mapping:
      0: white
      2: red
      7: orange
  - input_grid_values: [2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
  - output_value: 7

actions:
  - operation: unknown
    input: input_grid_values
    output: output_value

relationships:
  - output_value_color corresponds to the result of an unknown operation on non-white input grid values.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-zero (non-white) pixels in the input grid.
2.  Perform an as yet unknown mathematical action on the non-zero values.
3. Assign result of the unknown operation as the single output value.
.

In this specific example:
Count the number of non-zero pixels in the input (which are all '2' or red in color, and total 4). The output value if 7 (orange)

It appears the output is related to performing a simple count.
More examples are needed to determine all conditions.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
