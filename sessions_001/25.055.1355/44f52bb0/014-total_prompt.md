## Example 3

**input:**
```
2 0 2
2 0 2
2 0 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7DCBFC2D6C50>

**output:**
```
1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=64x64 at 0x7DCBFC2D4880>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example:

**Perception:**

The input is a 3x3 grid containing the digits '2' and '0', representing red and white pixels, respectively. The output is a single digit '1', which corresponds to the color blue. It appears the transformation involves counting or evaluating specific elements within the input grid and representing the result with a single blue pixel. The transformation likely involves a reduction of the entire input grid into a single-pixel output. The most obvious pattern is counting something and then replacing everything with a single pixel of color blue representing the number.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: [2, 0]
      element_colors:
        2: red
        0: white
  - output:
      type: single_pixel
      value: 1
      color: blue
  - transformation:
      type: reduction
      description: "The input grid is reduced to a single-pixel output."
  - potential_operations:
    - counting: count a specific element or feature in input
    - color_change: output value is associated with a different color (blue)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Count** the number of red pixels (represented by the digit '2') in the input grid.
2.  Create a 1x1 output grid.
3.  Set the value of this single cell in output grid to the count obtained in step 1.
4. Output has a value of 1 (blue), I suspect there is another example where input would yield a different value. If there are other examples that resulted in values other than 1, this could be a simplification.

Alternative (based on a constant output value):

1.  **Observe** the input grid (regardless of its content).
2.  Create a 1x1 output grid.
3. Set the value of single pixel to 1.
4.   Output this value is represented by blue.

It is more likely the alternative program is correct, counting instances of '2' would return '6' which would not have a corresponding value of 1. It seems likely the next example might give some insight.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
