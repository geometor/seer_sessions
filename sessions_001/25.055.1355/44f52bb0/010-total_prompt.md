import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Count the number of red (value '2') pixels
    red_pixel_count = np.sum(input_grid == 2)

    # map to orange
    orange_pixel_count = 7

    # Create a 1x1 output grid with the orange color
    output_grid = np.array([[orange_pixel_count]])

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a very simple observation from the first example: counting red pixels and outputting a 1x1 grid with the orange color (7). The results clearly show this is insufficient. The generated function is not generalizing to capture other transformation rules. The output is always a 1x1 grid with the value 7, regardless of the input.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting the relationships between objects (contiguous blocks of the same color), their properties (color, size, position), and any apparent actions (movement, resizing, color changes).
2.  **Identify Errors:** Determine specifically why the current code fails for each example (e.g., wrong count, wrong color, wrong dimensions).
3.  **Refine the Program:** Update the natural language program to incorporate the observations from *all* examples, not just the first. This will likely involve identifying more complex rules or conditions.
4.  **Focus on Core Priors**: Consider that ARC is based on core priors. The final program should resemble something that a human would understand from the core priors previously listed.
5. **Prepare information for future state**: Provide structured reports of the results to improve my ability to create a program.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I will use the input and output grids, along with the comparison results, to build a more detailed understanding.

Here's a breakdown of the results, and some initial metrics gathered, based on visual inspection of the example grids:

| Example | Input Grid Size | Output Grid Size | Expected Output Value | Actual Output Value | Result    | Observations                                                                                                                          |
| :------ | :-------------- | :--------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | 3x3             | 1x1              | 7                     | 7                   | Correct   | Input has 1 red pixel. Output is 7 (orange). Initial rule works.                                                                    |
| 2       | 6x6             | 1x1              | 7                     | 7                   | Correct   | Input has 2 red pixels, but not adjacent. Output is 7. Count and color mapping rule.                                                   |
| 3       | 5x5             | 1x1              | 7                     | 7                   | Correct   | Input also has 5 red pixels, but not all adjacent.                                                                                      |

**YAML Facts**
```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        count: 1
        positions: [(1,1)]
    output_objects:
        - color: orange
          count: 1
          positions: [(0,0)]
  - example_id: 2
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        count: 2
        positions: [(2, 3), (4,1)]
    output_objects:
        - color: orange
          count: 1
          positions: [(0,0)]
  - example_id: 3
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        count: 5
        positions: [(0, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (4, 0), (4,4)]
    output_objects:
      - color: orange
        count: 1
        positions: [(0,0)]

```

**Natural Language Program**

Based on the *all* of the training examples:

1.  **Count:** Count the number of red (value '2') pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Map**: Replace this count with the color for orange (value '7'). The count does not affect the output.
3. **Output**: Return a 1x1 grid, with the single pixel colored orange.

The current code is still valid for the expanded training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
