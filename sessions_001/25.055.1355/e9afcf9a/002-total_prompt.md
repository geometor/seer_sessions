## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 3 3 3 3
9 9 9 9 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7DCBFF3CBE20>

**output:**
```
3 9 3 9 3 9
9 3 9 3 9 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=384x128 at 0x7DCBFF3CAB90>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two rectangular grids. The input grid consists of two rows: the top row is all green (3), and the bottom row is all maroon (9). The output grid also has two rows, but the colors alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in a checkerboard pattern. The dimensions of the input and output grids are the same (2 rows x 6 columns).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - entity: input_grid
    attributes:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 2x6
      rows:
        - [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
        - [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
  - entity: output_grid
    attributes:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 2x6
      rows:
        - [3, 9, 3, 9, 3, 9]
        - [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 3]
  - observation:
      description: "The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid."
  - observation:
      description: "The output grid alternates colors in each row and column."
  - observation:
    description: The first cell of input is same value as the first cell of the output.
  - action:
      description: "Create a checkerboard pattern using the colors from the input."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Checkerboard Pattern:** Iterate through each cell of the output grid, determining its color based on its row and column indices.
    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is even, set the cell color to the color of the corresponding cell on the first row of the original input grid. (green/3)
    *   If the sum of the row and column indices is odd, set the cell color to the color of the corresponding cell on the second row of the original input grid. (maroon/9)

Essentially the first cell will be the same as the original input, and everything will alternate from there.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
