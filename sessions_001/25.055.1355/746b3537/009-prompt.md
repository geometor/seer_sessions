Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation extracts the top row of the input grid and creates a new grid with that row. The height of output is one, and the width of the output is the same as the width of the input. The values and their order in the selected row are preserved.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Initialize the output grid with dimensions 1 x cols.
    output_grid = np.zeros((1, cols), dtype=int)

    # Copy the first row of the input grid to the output grid.
    output_grid[0, :] = input_grid[0, :]

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
