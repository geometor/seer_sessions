The input is a 3x5 grid, and the output is a 1x4 grid. The colors in the output grid appear to be a subset of the colors present in the input grid. The input grid consists of repeating rows. The transformation seems to involve extracting unique elements based on columns and removing duplicates based on some criteria. One observation is that there are two '3's and we don't just take unique numbers as 3 is presented in the output once.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
