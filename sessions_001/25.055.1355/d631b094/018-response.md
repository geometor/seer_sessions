"""
1.  **Identify Objects:**  Each non-zero pixel in the input grid is treated as a separate object.
2.  **Object Properties:** The relevant properties of each object are its color and its existence (being non-zero). The position is not directly used for transforming.
3. **Determine Output Size:**
   * If there is only 1 object, output size is 1 x 1.
   * If there are 2 objects, output size is 2 x 1.
4.  **Copy Objects:** All identified input objects' colors are copied to the output.
5. **Determine Output Object Positions**
    * If there is only 1 object, place it in the output at (0,0).
    * If there are two objects, they are placed in the output grid at (0,0) and (1,0) based on the order of the objects. The object id does not appear to be relevant to the order, however we do not have information to confirm this.
