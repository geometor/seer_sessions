Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 3x3 grid with cells containing either '0' (white) or '2' (red).
*   **Output:** A 1x3 grid (one row, three columns) where all cells are '2' (red).
*   The core transformation appears to involve extracting the color '2' (red) from the input grid and reconstructing it into a single row in the output.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 1x3
    elements:
      - value: 2
        color: red
  - action: extract
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    property: color
    value: 2
  - action: reconstruct
    dimensions: 1x3
    value: 2
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Scan** the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all cells with the value '2' (red).
3.  **Extract** the red color.
4. **Construct** the output as a new grid with the extracted value and grid dimensions is 1x3.

In simpler terms, the program finds all red cells in the input and creates a 1x3 output grid filled with red cells.
