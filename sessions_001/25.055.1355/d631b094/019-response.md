Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 1x4 grid. The colors present are white (0) and azure (8). The input grid contains both azure and white pixels, while the output grid contains only azure pixels. The number of azure pixels in the input grid appears to match the number of azure pixels in the output grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input is a 3x3 grid.
    type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
  - observation: Output is a 1x4 grid.
    type: grid
    dimensions: [1, 4]
  - observation: Input grid contains pixels of color 0 (white) and 8 (azure).
    type: color_presence
    colors: [0, 8]
  - observation: Output grid contains only pixels of color 8 (azure).
    type: color_presence
    colors: [8]
  - observation: The number of azure pixels in the input (4) equals the number of azure pixels in the output (4).
    type: quantity
    color: 8
    input_count: 4
    output_count: 4
  - object: azure_pixels
    color: 8
      
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify**: Find all pixels with the color azure (8) in the input grid.
2.  **Count**: Count the number of azure pixels.
3. **Construct**: Create a new 1 x N grid, where N is the number of azure colored pixels in the input grid.
4. **Populate**: Fill all cells of the new grid with the value 8 (azure).
