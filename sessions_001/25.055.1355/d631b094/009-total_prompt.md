Previous Code:
```python
"""
Finds all red cells in the input and creates a 1x3 output grid filled with red cells.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid to output.
    """
    # Initialize output_grid as a 1x3 numpy array filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((1, 3), dtype=int)

    # Find all cells with value 2 in the input grid.
    red_cells = np.where(np.array(input_grid) == 2)

    # Count the number of red cells (though not strictly necessary for this specific task)
    # num_red_cells = len(red_cells[0])

    # If red color exist, Set all cells in output_grid to 2
    if len(red_cells[0]) > 0:
      output_grid[:] = 2

    return output_grid.tolist()

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
