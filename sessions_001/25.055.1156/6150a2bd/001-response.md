Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integer values (0-9)
  - transformation: rotation
    details:
      - direction: appears to be counter-clockwise or clockwise with a potential reflection
      - angle: 90 degrees, needs confirmation
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The colors of the pixels are preserved during the rotation. Visualize taking the input grid and turning it so the top row becomes the rightmost column, right column becomes bottom, and bottom row becomes left.

Or written another way

1.  Read the input grid.
2.  Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Output is the rotated grid.
