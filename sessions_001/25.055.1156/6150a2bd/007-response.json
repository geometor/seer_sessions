Each pixel is represented by a single digit integer (0-9), corresponding to a specific color. The input grid appears to be rotated and possibly inverted to produce the output grid. The colors themselves are also maintained during the transformation, with the positions being re-arranged.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
