The input grids appear to contain multiple colored blocks, some of which have single, isolated pixels of a different color inside them. The output grid seems to select one representative pixel from certain colored blocks within the input. The background color is consistently white (0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The overall input is segmented into 3x3 regions.\n2.  **Select Representative Pixel:** For each of the 3x3 regions on input, select the color that makes a square block in the input.\n3.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid. Fill each cell of the output grid with the color identified in the corresponding block of the input. If no block of a single color fills the 3x3 segment, take the color at the center. If input does not have a colored block, use the background color (0).\n\nEssentially the input image can be divided into nine 3x3 regions, and the output is the major color for that region.\n"
