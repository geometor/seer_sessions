Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example only, and as expected, it doesn't generalize perfectly to all training examples. The core idea of extracting values from 3x3 subgrids and placing them in a 3x3 output grid has merit, but the specifics of *which* subgrids are used and *where* in the output grid the extracted values are placed need adjustment. The initial strategy assumed the top-center and bottom-center subgrids, but this assumption should be modified by the other examples in the training set.

The strategy for resolving discrepancies will involve:

1.  **Detailed Error Analysis:** Examining each input-output pair where the code failed, pinpointing the exact locations of incorrect pixels in the generated output.
2.  **Subgrid Mapping Re-evaluation:** Determining the correct mapping between input subgrids and output positions for all training examples.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** We might need conditional logic (if statements) to handle variations between examples, especially if the rule changes based on input characteristics.
4.  **Refined Natural Language Program:** Based on the analysis, creating a more precise and comprehensive natural language program describing the generalized transformation.
5. **First Non-Zero Re-evaluation:** We are taking only the first non-zero value of each grid, but we must validate this approach.

**Metrics and Observations (via Code Execution)**
Here is the result of code execution of the previous generated code against all training examples:

```text
example_idx: 0, result: pass
example_idx: 1, result: fail
example_idx: 2, result: fail

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Division:** The 9x9 input grid is conceptually divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.

2.  **Conditional Extraction:**
    *   If a non-zero value exists in the top-center subgrid (row 0, column 3), extract the first non-zero value found and place it at position (0, 1) in the 3x3 output grid. All other output grid cells are set to 0.
    *   If there are *no* non-zero values in the top-center subgrid, then check for non-zero values in the bottom-center subgrid (row 6, column 3). Extract the first non-zero value and place it at position (2, 1) of the output grid. All other cells in the output grid are 0.

3. **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing at most one non-zero value and the remaining values all zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
