  - task: "Transform a grid of colored pixels into a 3x3 grid."
  - observation: "The input grids are all the same size, 18x18."
  - observation: "The input grids all have a single contiguous region of the same color."
  - observation: "The output grids are all 3x3."
  - observation: "The output grid always has the color of the input's single region in the top-left corner, and all other cells are black (0)."
  - action: "Identify the single contiguous region in the input grid."
  - action: "Determine the color of the identified region."
  - action: "Place the color in cell (0,0) of the output grid."
  - action: "Fill remaining cells of the output grid with black (0)."
