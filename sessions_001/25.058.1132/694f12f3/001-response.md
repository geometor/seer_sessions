Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels. The primary colors observed are yellow (4), blue (1), and red (2). The background is consistently white (0). The transformation seems to involve identifying rectangular shapes of uniform color (yellow in the examples) and altering the inner pixels of those shapes to a different color. The alteration pattern appears dependent on the shape's position within the grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: rectangle
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: rectangular
      - contents: uniform
    actions:
      - fill_interior:
          conditions:
            - position: top-left
            - color: blue(1)
            - rows: 2
            - cols: 2
            - type: square
            - position: top-left
            - position: bottom-right
            - color: blue (1)
            - rows: 2
            - type: square
            - cols: 2
          conditions:
            - color: red (2)
            - type: rectangle
            - position: bottom-right
            - position: top-left
            - rows: 2

  - grid:
      properties:
        - background_color: white (0)
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Locate all rectangular regions of uniform color (yellow/4) within the input grid.
2.  **Conditional Interior Fill:** For each identified rectangle, apply the following logic:

    *   If the rectangle is in the top-left part of the grid, and it is composed of at least 2 rows, fill the inner 2x2 center of the rectangle with blue (1).
    *   If the rectangle is in the bottom-right part of the grid, and it is composed of at least two rows, fill the inner area that is 2 rows high rectangle with red (2).

The definition of the top-left/bottom-right "part" will be refined. It is apparent from the examples that the program should check for yellow rectangles and based on where those yellow rectangles are located within the grid, replace the inner contents with blue or red.
