Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of digits, where each digit represents a color. The input grid contains two distinct rectangular regions of color '4' (yellow) against a background of color '0' (white). The output grid shows modifications within these yellow regions. Specifically, the inner parts of these regions are changed to color '1' (blue) in the top rectangle and to color '2' (red) in the bottom rectangle. The outlines of the original yellow rectangles remain unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: background
    color: 0
    description: The background color of the entire grid.
  - id: rectangle_1
    color: 4
    shape: rectangle
    location: top-left
    action: inner_fill
    fill_color: 1
  - id: rectangle_2
    color: 4
    shape: rectangle
    location: bottom-right
    action: inner_fill
    fill_color: 2
relationships:
  - rectangle_1 and rectangle_2 are separated by background.
  - The filled area of rectangle_1 and rectangle_2 does not include the outline.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Rectangles:** Locate all rectangular regions of color '4' (yellow) on the input grid.
2.  **Separate Rectangles:** Distinguish the rectangles based on location (top and bottom).
3.  **Inner Fill (Top Rectangle):** For the top-most rectangle, change the color of the inner pixels (excluding the outline) to '1' (blue).
4.  **Inner Fill (Bottom Rectangle):** For the bottom-most rectangle, change the color of the inner pixels (excluding the outline) to '2' (red).
5. **Preserve Outline:** Do not modify the original outline of the rectangles. Maintain pixels of original rectangle color.
6. **Output:** The output grid should reflect these changes, preserving background.
