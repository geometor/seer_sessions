Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided code and results to refine the natural language program and address the discrepancies.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was designed to identify yellow rectangles, and fill the top-left one with red and the bottom-right one with blue, keeping a one-pixel yellow border. The provided training examples and execution results reveal that this rule doesn't consistently hold across all cases. The core issue isn't the rectangle identification or the filling process, but rather, *which* rectangle gets filled with *which* color needs adjustment. It seems the criteria is not top-left and bottom-right.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** For each example, I'll meticulously document the input and output grids, focusing on the yellow rectangles, their positions, sizes, and the colors they are filled with.
2.  **Hypothesis Refinement:** Based on the detailed analysis, I'll reformulate the rule governing color selection. The top-left/bottom-right distinction appears incorrect. I will explore other possible relationships (e.g., size, relative position, absolute position).
3.  **YAML Documentation:** I'll create a YAML structure summarizing the observed facts, focusing on relevant object attributes and the actions applied.
4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Finally, I'll present a refined natural language program that accurately captures the observed transformation rule.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To gather precise metrics, I'll conceptually execute parts of the provided code. This is a "thought experiment" version of code execution since I can't run actual code.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: One yellow rectangle.
    *   Output: Rectangle filled with red.
    *   Metrics:
        *   Yellow Objects: 1
        *   Object 1: `min_row=1, max_row=5, min_col=1, max_col=7`, filled with red (2)

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: Two yellow rectangles.
    *   Output: Top-left rectangle filled red, bottom-right filled blue.
    *   Metrics:
        *   Yellow Objects: 2
        *   Object 1: `min_row=1, max_row=4, min_col=1, max_col=6`, filled with red (2)
        *   Object 2: `min_row=6, max_row=9, min_col=8, max_col=13`, filled with blue (1)

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: Two yellow rectangles.
    *    Output: Top Right rectangle filled with red, Bottom Left rectangle filled with blue
    *   Metrics:
        *    Yellow Objects: 2
        *    Object 1: min_row=2, max_row=4, min_col=12, max_col=15, filled with red (2)
        *    Object 2: min_row=7, max_row=10, min_col=4, max_col=9, filled with blue (1)

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
examples:
  - example_id: 1
    yellow_rectangles:
      - bounds: [1, 5, 1, 7]
        fill_color: red
    rectangle_count: 1
  - example_id: 2
    yellow_rectangles:
      - bounds: [1, 4, 1, 6]
        fill_color: red
      - bounds: [6, 9, 8, 13]
        fill_color: blue
    rectangle_count: 2
  - example_id: 3
    yellow_rectangles:
      - bounds: [2,4,12,15]
        fill_color: red
      - bounds: [7,10,4,9]
        fill_color: blue
    rectangle_count: 2
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all yellow rectangles in the input grid.
2.  Maintain a one-pixel border of yellow around each rectangle.
3. If there is one yellow rectangle, fill the inside with red.
4. If there are two yellow rectangles, fill the one positioned more towards the top or right of the image with red and the other with blue.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
