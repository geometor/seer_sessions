The input grid contains two distinct rectangular regions of color '4' (yellow) against a background of color '0' (white). The output grid shows modifications within these yellow regions. Specifically, the inner parts of these regions are changed to color '1' (blue) in the top rectangle and to color '2' (red) in the bottom rectangle. The outlines of the original yellow rectangles remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
