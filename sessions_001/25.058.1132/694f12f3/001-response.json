The primary colors observed are yellow (4), blue (1), and red (2). The background is consistently white (0). The transformation seems to involve identifying rectangular shapes of uniform color (yellow in the examples) and altering the inner pixels of those shapes to a different color. The alteration pattern appears dependent on the shape's position within the grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
