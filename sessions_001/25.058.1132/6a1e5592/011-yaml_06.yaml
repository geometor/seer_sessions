  - name: WhitePixel
    color: 0
    behavior:  May be transformed to BluePixel based on proximity to RedPixel and position.
  - name: BluePixel
    color: 1
    behavior: Result of transformation, appears near RedPixel.

actions:
  - name: GrayToWhite
    input: GrayPixel
    output: WhitePixel
    rule: All GrayPixels are replaced with WhitePixels.
  - name: WhiteToBlue
    input: WhitePixel
    output: BluePixel
    rule: >
      WhitePixels adjacent to RedPixels, and those adjacent to
      the resulting BluePixels extending horizontally from the adjacent
      pixels, are transformed to BluePixels.  The transformation area appears
      to be limited to the same row or rows immediately below the red pixels.
