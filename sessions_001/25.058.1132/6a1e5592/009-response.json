The input grid contains regions of red (2), white (0), and gray (5). The output grid seems to replace some, but not all, of the white (0) and gray (5) pixels with blue (1) and other white pixels with black pixels(0) based on some rules. The red (2) pixels mostly don't change. It seems like the top left corner white pixels are changing, and the gray areas are removed.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
