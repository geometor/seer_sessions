Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are composed of numbers representing colors. The most obvious change is the replacement of certain colors in the input grid with different colors in the output grid. The overall structure/shape is preserved. The task appears to involve a selective color replacement based on some criteria we need to discern. We can also see gray pixels are removed and replaced with white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 2, 5] # white, red, gray
      - dimensions: [10, 15]
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - colors: [0, 1, 2] # white, blue, red
      - dimensions: [10, 15]
  - action: color_replacement
    description: Certain colors in the input grid are replaced with other colors.
    rules:
      - input_color: 5 (gray)
        output_color: 0 (white)
      - input_color: 0 (white) within red outline
        output_color: 1 (blue)
  - observation: top_rows_unchanged
    description: The first row of the input grid remains unchanged in the output.
    details: all pixels of value 2

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Start with the input grid.
2.  **Gray Removal:** Replace all gray (5) pixels in the input grid with white (0) pixels.
3.  **Selective White Replacement:**  Identify regions of white (0) pixels that are *inside* a contiguous outline of red (2) pixels.
4. **Inside of red outline:** Replace the white(0) pixels inside of a contiguous outline of red (2) pixels to blue(1).
5. **Outside of red outline:** White(0) pixels not inside an outline are not changed
6.  **Preserve Red:** Red (2) pixels remain unchanged.
7.  **Output:** The modified grid is the output grid.

Essentially the program defines a simple flood fill within a boundary.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
