Both grids are composed of numbers representing colors. The most obvious change is the replacement of certain colors in the input grid with different colors in the output grid. The overall structure/shape is preserved. The task appears to involve a selective color replacement based on some criteria we need to discern. We can also see gray pixels are removed and replaced with white.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
