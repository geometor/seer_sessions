observations:
  - task_id: "6d049664"
  - objects:
      - color: gray (5)
        behavior: Replaced by white (0)
      - color: white (0)
        behavior:  Conditionally changed to blue (1)
      - color: red (2)
        behavior: Forms an enclosing outline; determines the conditional change of white pixels.
  - actions:
      - replace:
          from: gray (5)
          to: white (0)
      - conditional_replace:
          from: white (0)
          to: blue (1)
          condition: Enclosed by red (2) pixels.
  - enclosure_definition: |
      A white pixel is considered "enclosed" by red pixels if it is
      completely surrounded, where complete means that if we draw a line in
      any orthogonal direction, it will intersect at least one red pixel in
      that direction, including up, down, left, and right.
