The grids appear to be the same dimensions (3x3 in both provided examples). The colors (represented by numbers) within the grids change from input to output. It seems there's a consistent, though not immediately obvious, spatial transformation occurring. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color changes based on input colors, but rather a repositioning of the colors.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Each cell's value (color) in the input grid is moved to the corresponding cell's position in the output grid after the rotation.\n\n1.  **Input:** Take the given input grid.\n2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Imagine the grid is a physical object being turned.\n3.  **Output:** The rotated grid becomes the output grid. The color of cell \\[row,col] from original become color for \\[col, row\\_count-1-row]\n\nFor example, what starts in the top-right corner (0,2) of the input ends up in the top-left corner (0,0) of the output. The bottom left (2,0) of input becomes bottom right (2,2) in the output. and (1,1) stays (1,1)\n"
