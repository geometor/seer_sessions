Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid contains colored pixels with numerical values representing different colors (0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 5: gray). The output grid appears to be a rotated version of the input grid, but with the colors inverted, top-to-bottom.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    description: Input and output grids are 3x3 matrices.
  - object: pixels
    properties:
      - color: Represented by integers 0-9.
      - position: Defined by row and column indices.
  - transformation: rotation
    type: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90 #This will need verification later, but looks like it
    description: The input grid appears to be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to form the output grid.
  - transformation: color_inversion
    description: input is mirrored vertically, top-to-bottom
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Mirror:** Take the input grid and flip the rows vertically. The top row becomes the bottom, and the bottom row becomes the top, keeping their relative ordering.
