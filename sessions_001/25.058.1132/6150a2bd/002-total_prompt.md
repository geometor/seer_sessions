**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of colored squares, an input grid, and a corresponding output grid. The grids appear to be the same dimensions (3x3 in both provided examples). The colors (represented by numbers) within the grids change from input to output. It seems there's a consistent, though not immediately obvious, spatial transformation occurring. The transformation doesn't seem to involve simple color changes based on input colors, but rather a repositioning of the colors.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        rows: 3
        columns: 3
        cells:
          type: integer
          values: [0-9] # Representing colors
      instances:
        input_grid: {}
        output_grid: {}

actions:
  - rotate:
      object: grid
      direction: counter-clockwise
      degrees: 90

relationships:
  - spatial:
    - input_grid cells map to output_grid cells after rotation
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid. Each cell's value (color) in the input grid is moved to the corresponding cell's position in the output grid after the rotation.

1.  **Input:** Take the given input grid.
2.  **Rotate:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Imagine the grid is a physical object being turned.
3.  **Output:** The rotated grid becomes the output grid. The color of cell \[row,col] from original become color for \[col, row\_count-1-row]

For example, what starts in the top-right corner (0,2) of the input ends up in the top-left corner (0,0) of the output. The bottom left (2,0) of input becomes bottom right (2,2) in the output. and (1,1) stays (1,1)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
