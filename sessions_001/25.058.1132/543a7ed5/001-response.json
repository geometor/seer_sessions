Some shapes also contain pixels of yellow (4) and are outlined with green(3) instead of magenta(6).\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves changing some magenta (6) pixels to green (3), and potentially introducing yellow (4) pixels within the magenta shapes and some azure(8) to green(3).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
