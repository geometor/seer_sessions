Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Identify the red pixel (value 2) in the input grid.
2.  Replace all red pixels with green pixels (value 3).
3.  Expand the green area. Locate original green pixels. Form a 4x4 square from the top left original green pixel, extending to the right and downwards.
4.  Locate the center of the output. Create another 4x4 green square, starting from row 5, col 5, moving downwards and to the right.
5.  All the rest of pixels become white.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and as expected, it doesn't perfectly generalize to the other examples. The core issues seem to be:

1.  **Hardcoded Dimensions:** The output grid size (9x9) and the size of the squares (4x4) are hardcoded. This won't work for inputs of different dimensions.
2.  **Fixed Positions:** The placement of the second square is fixed at row 4, column 4. This needs to be relative to the input/output grid dimensions.
3.  **Incorrect Trigger Shape:** First square expansion is related to shape, it is not always color triggered.
4.  **Missing Input/Output Relation:** The sizes of the grids are not related.

Our strategy will be to:

1.  **Parameterize Dimensions:** Determine output grid dimensions based on input and training pairs.
2.  **Dynamic Placement:** Calculate the position of the second square based on the center (or other relevant feature) of the output grid.
3.  **Shape Detection** Use shape and color to determine regions of interest.
4.  **Relation** Connect the input and output grid sizes by a mathematical operation.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformations, I'll use code execution to gather some metrics. I'll focus on:

*   Dimensions of input and output grids.
*   Positions of key colors (especially green and red).
*   Relationships between input and output dimensions.
*   Number of objects by shape and color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
