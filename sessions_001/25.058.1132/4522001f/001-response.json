The primary colors involved are green (3), white (0), and red (2).  The red pixel seems to act as a sort of \"removal\" signal, as it is always disappears and doesn't exist in the output. The green pixels seem to be the primary object(s) that get expanded/replicated.  The output grid is always filled; there are no empty spaces. The shape and area of the green object are what define the final pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Representation:**\n\n"
