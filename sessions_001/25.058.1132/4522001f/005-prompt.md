Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Identify the red pixel (value 2) in the input grid.
2.  Replace all red pixels with green pixels (value 3).
3.  Expand the green area. Locate original green pixels. Form a 4x4 square from the top left original green pixel, extending to the right and downwards.
4.  Locate the center of the output. Create another 4x4 green square, starting from row 5, col 5, moving downwards and to the right.
5.  All the rest of pixels become white.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
