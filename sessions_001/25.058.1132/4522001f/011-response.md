Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our understanding of the transformation.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, and it correctly identified the expansion of each input pixel into a 3x3 block (not 4x4 as stated in doc strings) in the output, and the color replacement of red (2) with green (3). However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule is not universally applicable. There are errors in the other training examples, indicating that the transformation rule needs refinement. The core issue is that the initial rule is too specific and doesn't capture the underlying general principle.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine all input-output pairs, not just the first one.
2.  **Identify common patterns:** Look for consistent relationships between inputs and outputs across all examples.
3.  **Object Identification:** Determine what constitutes an "object" in this context.
4. **Refine Hypotheses:** Formulate a new natural language program
    that accounts for *all* observed transformations.
5.  **Iterate and Validate:** Re-run all examples and gather observation to make a more accurate hypothesis for the transformation rule.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To help, I'll create the expected and actual output for each of the train examples and describe what I see:

**Example 1:**

*   Input: `[[1, 8, 1], [8, 2, 8], [1, 8, 1]]`
*   Expected Output: `[[1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1]]`
*   Actual Output: `[[1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1]]`
*   **Observation:** The code works perfectly for this example. 3x3 expansion with Red(2) changed to Green(3).

**Example 2:**

*   Input: `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`
*   Expected Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8], [6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8], [6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8]]`
*   Actual Output: `[[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8], [6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8], [6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8]]`
*   **Observation:** The code works, except that the color `2` was incorrectly replaced with `3` when it shouldn't have been.

**Example 3:**

*   Input: `[[7, 0, 7], [0, 7, 0], [7, 0, 7]]`
*   Expected Output: `[[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]]`
*   Actual Output: `[[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]]`
*   **Observation:** The code works - there were no `2` values to replace.

**YAML Facts:**

  - description: "Pixel color is mostly preserved in expansion."
    type: "color_property"

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
2.  **Output:** A 9x9 grid.
3.  **Expansion:** Each pixel in the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid. The top-left pixel of the input grid corresponds to the top-left 3x3 block of the output, and so on for all pixels creating a direct mapping of each input pixel to a 3x3 area.
4.  **Color Mapping:** The color of each pixel in the input grid is directly copied to the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid. If an input pixel color is 2 (red), then its color will change to 3 (green) for the corresponding 3x3 block.
