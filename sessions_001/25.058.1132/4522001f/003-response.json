The original 3x3 input seems to be replicated and/or transformed. The red color (2) is removed, replaced with green (3). A large green (3) square structure is created. White(0) areas expand too.\n* **Transformation:** It appears the red color in input is key, The green color expands/replaces to form two squares which is combined, a 4x4 on upper left, and anther 4x4 square on the lower right.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
