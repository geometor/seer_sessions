The smaller grid contains pixels of colors white (0), red (2), and green (3).  The larger grid seems to be an expansion, primarily using white (0) and green (3), with the red (2) seemingly removed or replaced. The green (3) pixels in the input appear to be replicated in a 4x4 block within the larger grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The top-left corner of the block is positioned based on the input pixel location; specifically it forms a block at `(3 * row, 3* col)` for an input green pixel at `input[row][col]` .\n   - If the input pixel is red (2), treat it like green(3). Create a 4x4 block of green (3) in output grid. The top-left corner of the block is positioned based on the input pixel location; specifically it forms a block at `(3 * row, 3* col)` for an input red pixel at `input[row][col]` .\n     - If the input pixel is white(0), create a 4x4 block of white (0) in the output grid.  The top-left corner of the block is positioned based on the input pixel location; specifically it forms a block at `(3 * row, 3* col)` for an input red pixel at `input[row][col]` .\n\n3.  **Output:** The resulting 9x9 grid is the output.\n\nIn essence, the transformation replaces red with green, and then expands each pixel in the original image, excluding the white pixels, into a 4x4 block of the same color in the expanded image, and fills other spaces formed by the expansion by the background color.\n"
