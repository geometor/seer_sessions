objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          values: [0, 4, 7]
          mapping:
            0: white
            4: yellow
            7: orange

  - name: yellow_shape
    type: contiguous block
    properties:
        color: yellow
        possible_shapes:
            - rectangle: [3x2, 2x3]
            - isolated: 1x1

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: yellow_shape
    target: specific yellow pixels
    precondition:
      - pixel is part of shape
      - there is a yellow pixel directly below the top right yellow pixel and is either not boardered on the left or right by another yellow, or it is directly above another yellow that is part of a 3x2 group.

    result:
      - color changes from yellow(4) to orange(7)

relationships:
   - Adjacent: pixels share a side
