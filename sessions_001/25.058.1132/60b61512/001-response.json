The primary colors involved seem to be yellow (4) and orange (7). The background is white (0). The transformation seems to involve some interaction between adjacent yellow pixels, potentially changing some of them to orange.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A cluster is defined as one or more yellow pixels that are directly adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).\n\n2. **Inner vs. Outer:** Within each yellow cluster, determine \"inner\" and \"outer\" yellow pixels. An \"outer\" yellow pixel is one that is adjacent to at least one white (0) pixel. An \"inner\" yellow pixel is one that is *only* adjacent to other yellow pixels. If the element has 1 dimension of only 1 cell then all the pixels in this cluster should be considered outer.\n\n3. **Conditional Color Change:** For each yellow cluster within an input, if an \"inner\" yellow pixel is detected then transform this \"inner\" pixel into orange (7). Do not change any outer pixels to orange.\n\n4. **Output:** Create the output grid by applying the color changes to the original input grid.\n"
