Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  Identify the blue (color 1) object in the input grid.
2.  Find the horizontal center (x-axis center, i.e. column index) of the blue object.
3.  Draw a vertical line of color 6 (magenta) across the entire height of the grid.
4.  The line should be x coordinate of the horizontal center. The blue object may be partially or completely replaced with magenta pixels.
5. All other pixels remain the same.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
