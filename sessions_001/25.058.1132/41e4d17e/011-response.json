The primary colors involved are azure (8), blue (1), and magenta (6).  The input grid contains two separate, non-contiguous \"shapes\" or \"objects\" formed by blue (1) pixels, surrounded by an azure (8) background. The output grid seems to maintain the overall structure of these blue objects but introduces magenta (6) pixels in a seemingly specific pattern related to the azure background and, possibly, the boundaries of the blue shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
