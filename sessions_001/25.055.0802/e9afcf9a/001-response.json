The input grid consists of two rows: the top row is all green (3), and the bottom row is all maroon (9). The output grid also has two rows, but the colors alternate between green (3) and maroon (9) in both rows, in a checkerboard pattern. The overall dimensions of the grid remain the same.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
