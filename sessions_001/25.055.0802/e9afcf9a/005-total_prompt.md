Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Preserve Dimensions:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.

2.  **Row-wise Transformation:** Each row of the input grid is transformed independently.

3. **Identify Row's initial color:** For each row, use the color of the first pixel of that row in the input grid as color_1.

4.  **Alternating Pattern:** Each row in the output grid consists of an alternating pattern of two colors.

5.  **Determine Color 1:** The first pixel of each output row has the same color as the first pixel of the corresponding input row (color_1).

6.  **Determine Color 2:**
    - If color_1 is *not* 9, the second color (color_2) used in the alternating pattern is 9.
    - If color_1 *is* 9, then the second color (color_2) will match the color value of the *second* pixel of the input row.

7. **Apply alternating colors:** Apply the two colors on each row in an alternating pattern
    - odd numbered columns get color_1
    - even numbered columns get color_2.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
