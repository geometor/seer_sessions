## Example 1

**input:**
```
4 4 8
6 4 3
6 3 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E064400>

**output:**
```
4 4 4
4 4 4
4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E065930>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored squares (pixels). The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid consists of only one color (yellow, represented by the number 4). The dimensions of the grid remain constant between input and output (3x3). The core transformation appears to be a replacement of all colors in the input grid with a single, specific color found within the input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 3x3 grids of colored pixels.
  - property: color
    values: [0, 3, 4, 6, 8] # Colors present in the input.
    mapping: {0: white, 3: green, 4: yellow, 6: magenta, 8: azure}
  - object: pixel
    description: Each cell in the grid is a pixel with a color value.
  - transformation: color replacement
    description: All pixels in the output grid are yellow (4).
  - relation: constant dimensions
    description: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - target_color:
    value: 4
    description: "The color yellow (4) from the input is used for all cells in the output"

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the target color:**  In the input grid, find the color yellow (represented by the value 4).
2.  **Replace all colors:** Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid. Fill every cell of this new grid with the target color (yellow/4).
3.  **Output:** The new grid, now entirely yellow, is the output.

In essence, the program identifies a specific color (yellow, 4) within the input and uses it to overwrite all other colors in the grid, maintaining the original grid structure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
