Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is to replace all pixels in the input grid with the color yellow (4). The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid, but every cell is filled with the value 4.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid by replacing all pixels with yellow (4).

    Args:
        input_grid (numpy.ndarray): The input grid.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The output grid with all pixels set to yellow (4).
    """
    # Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.  We copy to keep the same dimensions.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Replace all elements in the output_grid with the value 4 (yellow).
    output_grid[:] = 4

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
