The input grid contains various colors, while the output grid consists of only one color (yellow, represented by the number 4). The dimensions of the grid remain constant between input and output (3x3). The core transformation appears to be a replacement of all colors in the input grid with a single, specific color found within the input grid.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
