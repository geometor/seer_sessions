Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a simple 3x3 grid in both the input and output. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation appears to be a consistent mapping of input colors/digits to output colors/digits. There are no obvious spatial transformations or manipulations of the grid structure itself.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: integers  # Representing colors
    transformation_type: color_mapping

  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - cell_values: [3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
      - shape: 3x3

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - cell_values: [4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6]
      - shape: 3x3

  - relationship: element-wise_mapping
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    mapping:
      3: 4  # Green to Yellow
      1: 5  # Blue to Gray
      2: 6  # Red to Magenta
```



**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color-to-color (or digit-to-digit) substitution.  The input grid is transformed into the output grid by replacing each digit in the input with a corresponding digit according to the following mapping:

1.  Input digit 3 (green) is replaced with digit 4 (yellow).
2.  Input digit 1 (blue) is replaced with digit 5 (gray).
3.  Input digit 2 (red) is replaced with digit 6 (magenta).

The grid structure (3x3) remains unchanged. It's a direct one-to-one mapping of cell values based on their original value, not their position.
