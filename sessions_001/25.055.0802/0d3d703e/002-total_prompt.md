## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 1 2
3 1 2
3 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E0656F0>

**output:**
```
4 5 6
4 5 6
4 5 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E066200>
Okay, here's my analysis of the example input-output pair, structured as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a simple 3x3 grid in both the input and output. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation appears to be a consistent mapping of input colors/digits to output colors/digits. There are no obvious spatial transformations or manipulations of the grid structure itself.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements: integers  # Representing colors
    transformation_type: color_mapping

  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - cell_values: [3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
      - shape: 3x3

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - cell_values: [4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6]
      - shape: 3x3

  - relationship: element-wise_mapping
    source: input_grid
    target: output_grid
    mapping:
      3: 4  # Green to Yellow
      1: 5  # Blue to Gray
      2: 6  # Red to Magenta
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple color-to-color (or digit-to-digit) substitution.  The input grid is transformed into the output grid by replacing each digit in the input with a corresponding digit according to the following mapping:

1.  Input digit 3 (green) is replaced with digit 4 (yellow).
2.  Input digit 1 (blue) is replaced with digit 5 (gray).
3.  Input digit 2 (red) is replaced with digit 6 (magenta).

The grid structure (3x3) remains unchanged. It's a direct one-to-one mapping of cell values based on their original value, not their position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
