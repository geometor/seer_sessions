## Example 2

**input:**
```
2 3 8
2 3 8
2 3 8
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E066200>

**output:**
```
6 4 9
6 4 9
6 4 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70DF5E0656F0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. Each pixel has a numerical value corresponding to a specific color. The transformation appears to involve a consistent change in these numerical values, and therefore the colors, while maintaining the grid structure. It seems to be a simple color mapping.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - attribute: color
        values: integers (0-9)

actions:
  - type: color_mapping
    description: Each pixel's color value is transformed to a new value.

relationships:
  - type: input_output
    description: The input grid maps directly to the output grid, with each corresponding pixel undergoing the same color transformation.
    mapping:
        2: 6
        3: 4
        8: 9
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Begin with a 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Transformation:** For each pixel in the input grid, apply the following color mapping:
    *   If the pixel is red (2), change it to magenta (6).
    *   If the pixel is green (3), change it to yellow (4).
    *   If the pixel is azure (8), change it to maroon (9).
3.  **Output:** Construct an output grid of the same dimensions (3x3) with each of it's pixels' colors determined by performing the transformation on the corresponding input grid pixel.

Essentially, the program is a direct color substitution based on the provided mapping, applied uniformly across all pixels of the grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
