Previous Code:

    Args:

    Returns:
        list of lists: A 2D array representing the transformed output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code implements a simple color substitution, which works correctly for the first training example. However, the results on the subsequent examples reveal that the transformation is consistent across all examples. The code correctly identifies the color mappings (red to magenta, green to yellow, and azure to maroon) and applies them consistently. Since all training examples show the same behavior, we can confirm that our program is correct and holds across all the train set.

**Strategy:**

My main strategy is to verify that the transformation rule holds across all examples. Since they are all consistent and correct, the natural language program can remain, however, I will test it for correctness.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on identifying discrepancies and validating the transformation rule:

```python
def report(task):
    correct_count = 0
    for example in task['train']:
        input_grid = example['input']
        expected_output = example['output']
        actual_output = transform(input_grid)
        if actual_output.tolist() == expected_output:
            correct_count += 1
            print(f"Example: Correct")
        else:
            print(f"Example: Incorrect")
            print(f"  Input: {input_grid}")
            print(f"  Expected Output: {expected_output}")
            print(f"  Actual Output: {actual_output.tolist()}")  # Convert to list for easy comparison
    print ("\nSummary of Results:")
    print (f"{correct_count} of {len(task['train'])} example transformations are correct")
report(task)

```
**Code Execution Results:**

```text
Example: Correct
Example: Correct
Example: Correct
Example: Correct

Summary of Results:
4 of 4 example transformations are correct
```

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves a color substitution transformation.
  Specific colors in the input grid are replaced with
  corresponding colors in the output grid, while the
  grid dimensions and other pixel colors remain unchanged.

observations:
  - object_type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: preserved_across_transformation
      - cell_values: represent_colors

  - action: color_substitution
    details:
      - red (2) -> magenta (6)
      - green (3) -> yellow (4)
      - azure (8) -> maroon (9)
    scope: applies_to_all_pixels_with_specified_colors
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule performs a direct color substitution on each pixel of the input grid. Red pixels are changed to magenta, green pixels to yellow, and azure pixels to maroon. The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged. All other colors remain the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
