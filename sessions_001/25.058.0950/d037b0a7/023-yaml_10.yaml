observations:
  - example_0:
    input_objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: rectangle
        initial_position: bottom-right corner, spanning multiple rows
    output_objects:
      - color: yellow
        shape: rectangle
        final_position:  Same as initial
    transformations:
       - description:  yellow rectangle remains in position
  - example_1:
    input_objects:
      - color: red
        shape: vertical line
        initial_position: right side of grid, interrupted by black pixels
      - color: black
        shape: L and single pixel
    output_objects:
      - color: red
        shape:  vertical line
        final_position: same as initial position, no extension
    transformations:
      - description:  The vertical red line segment remains the same, with no downward extension
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: red

          initial_position: bottom-right, multiple rows
      output_objects:
       - color: red
         shape: rectangle
         final_position: same as initial, no extension
      transformations:
        - description: The red shape remains unchanged
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: partial rectangle, cut off by black pixels
          initial_position: center-right
        - color: black
          shape:  two single pixel shape
          initial_position:  blocking the yellow
      output_objects:
        - color: yellow
          shape: partial rectangle
          final_position:  same as initial, no extension
        - color: black
          shape:  two single pixel shape
          final_position: unchanged
      transformations:
        - description:  The yellow shape remains unchanged, black pixels remain unchanged
