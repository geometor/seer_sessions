Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved extending yellow and red colors downwards. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally. The core issue seems to be that the extension of color downwards is not unconditional, but depends on a stopping criteria. The presence of a black pixel appears to stop extending the color.

The strategy to resolve the errors is to:

1.  **Analyze the Results:** Carefully examine the provided input/output/predicted output grids to identify patterns and discrepancies. We need to pinpoint exactly where the current logic fails.
2.  **Identify Stopping Condition:**  The key is to figure out what stops the downward propagation of color.  It's likely a specific color (black).
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to incorporate the stopping condition.
4.  **Refine code.**
5.  Verify on all examples.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including an assessment of where the code succeeded or failed:

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Predicted Output:** (Matches Expected)
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
* **Assessment:**  The code worked correctly on this example. The yellow and red colors were extended to the bottom of the grid.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
    ```
*   **Predicted Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]
    ```
* **Assessment:** The code failed. It extended the yellow and red colors *through* the black row.  The black row should have acted as a barrier.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Expected Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Predicted Output:**
    ```
    [[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
     [1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
     [0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
    ```
*   **Assessment:** The code failed. It extended the yellow and red colors *through* the black row. The black row should have acted as a barrier. The prediction also extends the red and yellow colors beyond the black row which is incorrect.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: yellow
    initial_positions: varies
    behavior: extends downwards
    stopping_condition: black pixels
  - color: red
    initial_positions: varies
    behavior: extends downwards
    stopping_condition: black pixels
  - color: black
    behavior: acts as a barrier
  - color: white
    behavior: remains unchanged

actions:
  - name: extend_downwards
    description: Propagate color downwards in the same column until a black pixel or the bottom of the grid is reached.
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify:** Find all yellow (4) and red (2) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Extend Downwards Conditionally:** For each yellow or red pixel, copy its color to the cells directly below it in the same column.
3.  **Stopping Condition:** Stop extending the color downwards when a black (1) pixel is encountered or the bottom of the grid is reached.
4. **Preserve other colors** If the color is any color other than yellow or red, leave it unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
