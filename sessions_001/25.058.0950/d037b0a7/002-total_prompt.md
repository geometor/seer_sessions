**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation appears to involve replicating certain non-zero values within the grid. The core operation seems to involve copying colors from the top row and applying it downwards.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: cells
    properties:
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)

  - type: cell
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9)
      - color:  (derived from value)
      - position: (row, column)

actions:
  - name: replicate_color
    description:  Copy color values downwards from certain cells.
    parameters:
        - source: cell
        - destination: cell
    preconditions:
      - "source.value != 0"
    postconditions:
        -"destination.value = source.value"
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Cells are arranged in a 3x3 grid.
  - type: transformation
    description: The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid, with some cell values changed according to a replication rule.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Source Colors:** Examine the top row (row 0) of the input grid. Identify any non-zero values (colors other than white).

2.  **Replicate Downwards:** For each non-zero value found in the top row, replicate that value downwards in the same column. Specifically:
    *   If a cell in the top row has a non-zero value, copy that value to the cells in the same column in the second row (row 1) and the third row (row 2).

3.  **Leave Other Cells Unchanged:** Any cells that don't have non-zero on first row remains the original value in input grid.

In essence, the transformation takes the colors present in the top row and "drops" them down, filling the corresponding columns below.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
