Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are 3x3 grids. The input grid contains three colors: yellow (4), white (0), and red (2). The transformation seems to involve extending the yellow and red colors downwards. The white pixels remain unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - type: pixel
        color: yellow (4)
        initial_position: (0,0)
      - type: pixel
        color: white (0)
        initial_positions: [(0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]
      - type: pixel
        color: red (2)
        initial_position: (1,1)

actions:
  - type: extend_color
    color: yellow (4)
    direction: down
    from_row: 0
    to_row: 2
  - type: extend_color
    color: red (2)
    direction: down
    from_row: 1
    to_row: 2

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Grid elements are arranged in rows and columns.
  - type: color_based_action
    description: The extension action is specific to colors yellow and red.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all pixels that are yellow (4).
2.  **Copy** the yellow color to all cells directly below it in the same column, extending down to the bottom row (row 2).
3.  **Identify** all pixels that are red (2).
4.  **Copy** the red color to all cells directly below it in the same column, down to the bottom row (row 2).
5.  **Leave** white pixels unchanged.

In simpler terms: The yellow and red colors are "dripped down" to the bottom of the grid, while white areas stay white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
