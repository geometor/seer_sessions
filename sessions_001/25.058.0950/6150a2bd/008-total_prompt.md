**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x71BED6343E30>

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation between the input and output grids appears to involve a rotation of the grid's contents. The colors/values themselves remain unchanged, only their positions within the grid are altered. The direction of the rotation is not immediately obvious.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped to integer values
      - position: row and column index

actions:
  - type: rotation
    affects: grid element positions
    direction:  Counter-Clockwise
    magnitude: 90 degrees

relationships:
  - input grid elements map to output grid elements based on rotated position.
  - colors/values of elements remain constant during transformation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the 3x3 grid. Each element in the input grid is moved to its new position in the output grid as if the entire grid were rotated. The values/colors of the individual cells are preserved, only their position changes.

Concretely:
- Input at position will get transformed
- (0,0) -> (0,2)
- (0,1) -> (1,2)
- (0,2) -> (2,2)
- (1,0) -> (0,1)
- (1,1) -> (1,1)
- (1,2) -> (2,1)
- (2,0) -> (0,0)
- (2,1) -> (1,0)
- (2,2) -> (2,0)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
