facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The colors (represented by integers) in the input grid are also present in the output grid.
  - observation: The relative positions of colors change between input and output.
  - observation: The transformation appears to be some form of grid rotation or mirroring.
  - subject: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (Example 1), 3x3 (Example 2)
      - content: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    actions:
