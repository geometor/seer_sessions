observations:
  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: 2  # red
            location: [6, 0]
          - color: 3 # green
            location: [6, 8]
        transformations: >
            The red object at [6,0] moves to [6,9]. The green object at [6,8] is removed.
      output:
        objects:
          - color: 2 # red
            location: [6, 9]

  - example_2:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: 4  # yellow
            location: [3, 0]
          - color: 6 # magenta
            location: [5, 8]

        transformations: >
           The yellow object at [3, 0] moves to [2, 9]. The magenta object at [5, 8] moves to [4, 9].
      output:
        objects:
          - color: 4 # yellow
            location: [2, 9]
          - color: 6 # magenta
            location: [4, 9]

  - example_3:
      input:
        objects:
          - color: 7  # orange
            location: [1, 0]
          - color: 1 # blue
            location: [6, 8]
        transformations: >
           The orange object at [1, 0] moves to [0, 9]. The blue object at [6, 8] moves to [5, 9].
      output:
        objects:
          - color: 7 # orange
            location: [0, 9]
          - color: 1 # blue
            location: [5, 9]

  general:
      - All white (0) pixels in the input grid remain white in the output grid.
      - All non-white pixels in the leftmost column are moved to the rightmost column.  The row appears to be calculated as (original_row - 1).
      - All non-white pixels except for the leftmost column are removed
