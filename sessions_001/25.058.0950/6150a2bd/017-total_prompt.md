Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation, analysis of the provided code and results, and the requested deliverables.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial transform function was based on a very limited understanding of the transformation, derived from the first example pair only.  The code reflects a simple mirroring operation (top to bottom, left to right) and zero preservation. The results on subsequent examples show that this initial hypothesis is incorrect. The predicted grids differ significantly from the expected output grids, particularly in the placement and persistence of non-zero colored pixels.

My strategy is to:

1. **Analyze Each Example Pair Individually:** Examine the input and output grids for *each* example, looking for specific changes and relationships between the colored pixels.
2. **Identify Common Patterns:** Determine if there's a consistent rule or set of rules applied across all examples. It seems positional rather than pure mirroring.
3. **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Based on the combined analysis, create a more accurate and comprehensive natural language description of the transformation.
4. **Prepare for Code Modification:** The YAML facts and the natural language program will inform the next stage (coding).

**Metrics and Observations (using previous Code Execution)**

The provided code already offers some helpful analysis. Let's summarize the key observations:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 7x10, two non-zero pixels (red at [6,0], green at [6,8]).
    *   Output: 7x10, one non-zero pixel (red at [6,9]).
    *   Predicted: 7x10, one non-zero pixel (red at [6,9]).
    *   **Analysis:** This example, by chance, works correctly with the existing code. The red pixel effectively shifts from the leftmost position to the rightmost, and the green pixel disappears. This led to the incorrect initial hypothesis.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 7x10, two non-zero pixels (yellow at [3,0], magenta at [5,8]).
    *   Output: 7x10, two non-zero pixels (yellow at [2,9], magenta at [4,9]).
    *   Predicted: 7x10, two non-zero pixels (yellow at [6,9], magenta at [5,9]).
    *   **Analysis:** The predicted output *incorrectly* places the yellow pixel at the bottom right. The output shows the yellow pixel has moved *up* two rows and to the far right. The magenta pixel also moves up one row and to the far right.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 7x10, two non-zero pixels (orange at [1,0], blue at [6,8]).
    *   Output: 7x10, two non-zero pixels (orange at [0,9], blue at [5,9]).
    *   Predicted: 7x10, two non-zero pixels (orange at [6,9], blue [6,9]).
    *  **Analysis:** The predicted output places both the orange and blue on row 6. The output orange is one up, and to the far right. Blue is one up, far right.

**Key Observation across all examples**: non-zero pixels from the input consistently appear at the far right (column 9) of the output grid. Their row index in the output seems to be related to their original row index in the input, *decreasing* by a certain amount. The amount is not consistent:
*   Example 2:  Yellow moves up two rows (3 -> 2). Magenta moves up one (5 -> 4)
*   Example 3:  Orange moves up one (1 -> 0). Blue moves up one (6 -> 5)

It seems that the colored pixel on the left moves to the top-right, and any other colored pixels are positioned below the top-right.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - object: non_zero_pixel
    properties:
      color: varied (red, green, yellow, magenta, orange, blue)
      initial_position: [row, column]  # Original coordinates in input grid
      final_position: [row, column]    # Coordinates in output grid
    actions:
      - move:
          description: "Non-zero pixels move to the last column (column index 9)."
          row_change: "The row index decreases. If the input pixel is in column 0, the output row index is original row index -1, otherwise the row index decreases to a value related to the other pixel locations."
          column_change: "The column index becomes 9."
      - disappear:
          description: "All input non-zero pixels, except the left-most, disappear"

  - object: zero_pixel
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      initial_position: [row, column]
      final_position: [row, column]
    actions:
      - remain:
          description: "Zero pixels (white) remain in their original positions."

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Zero Preservation:** All pixels with a value of 0 (white) in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

2.  **Non-Zero Pixel Movement:**
    *   All non-zero pixels in the input grid are moved to the far-right column (column index 9) of the output grid.
    *   The non-zero pixel in column 0 moves to the last column, and one row up.
    *   All other colored pixels disappear.
3. Blank cells created by moving the objects are filled with 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
