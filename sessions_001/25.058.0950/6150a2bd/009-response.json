            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding code (`np.rot90(input_array, k=1)`) correctly describe a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. However, the provided examples suggest that the input grids may not always be perfect 3 x 3 square grids. The program should handle the rotation logic for input arrays of different dimensions, as demonstrated by other examples (like the 6x6 and 14x12 ones) that follow the same 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation pattern. The core logic of a 90-degree CCW rotation is still valid, so the current code will correctly solve all of the provided examples.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\nNo errors are presented, all results were `True`. We can generate more information about the examples by:\n\n1.  **Verifying Dimensions**: Check the dimensions (height, width) of each input and output grid. This will confirm whether the transformation is applicable to various sizes, which it should be, given that `np.rot90` will rotate any 2d array.\n2.  **Pixel-Level Validation (Optional but helpful):** If the code had any incorrect output, we would pick a few specific pixels in the input and trace their positions in the output to ensure they match the expected 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. This can be helpful to build a very detailed and low-level understanding of the rotation.\n\n**Gather Metrics (using code_execution):**\n\nI will simulate \"code_execution\" to derive metrics and present them. Since I can't directly execute code, I will manually construct the expected output based on the rotation rule and the provided examples.\n\n```\nExample 1 (3x3):\nInput Dimensions: 3x3\nOutput Dimensions: 3x3\nResult: True\n\nExample 2 (6x6):\nInput Dimensions: 6x6\nOutput Dimensions: 6x6\nResult: True\n\nExample 3 (14x12):\nInput Dimensions: 14x12\nOutput Dimensions: 12x14\nResult: True\n```\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_set: train\n    examples:\n      - example_id: 1\n        input_grid_dimensions: [3, 3]\n        output_grid_dimensions: [3, 3]\n        objects:\n          - description: grid\n            properties:\n              - dimensions: [3, 3]\n              - type: 2D array\n              - elements: integers representing colors\n        actions:\n          - type: rotation\n            description: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation\n            result: transformed grid with elements repositioned\n\n      - example_id: 2\n        input_grid_dimensions: [6, 6]\n        output_grid_dimensions: [6, 6]\n        objects:\n          - description: grid\n            properties:\n              - dimensions: [6, 6]\n              - type: 2D array\n              - elements: integers representing colors\n        actions:\n          - type: rotation\n            description: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation\n            result: transformed grid with elements repositioned\n\n      - example_id: 3\n        input_grid_dimensions: [14, 12]\n        output_grid_dimensions: [12, 14]\n        objects:\n          - description: grid\n            properties:\n              - dimensions: [14, 12]\n              - type: 2D array\n              - elements: integers representing colors\n        actions:\n          - type: rotation\n            description: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation\n            result: transformed grid with elements repositioned\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\nThe transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the input grid. Each element (pixel) in the input grid is moved to its new position in the output grid according to this rotation. The color/value of each pixel remains constant; only its position changes. The rotation is applied regardless of the original dimensions of the input grid.\n"
