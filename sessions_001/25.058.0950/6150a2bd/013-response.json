The input grid contains various colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9), and the output grid seems to be a transformation of the input. The colors and positions of the pixels change between the input and output. There's a noticeable change in the arrangement and values of non-zero pixels. The zero-value pixels (white) seem to largely stay in place, acting like a background.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
