            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and corresponding Python code were a good first attempt, focusing on mirroring operations. However, the results on the full training set reveal that the transformation is more complex than simple top-to-bottom and left-to-right mirroring. The code successfully preserves zeroes, which is a correct aspect of the transformation. The mirroring, however, is only partially correct and doesn't capture the full logic. The core issue is that the transformation isn't a simple mirror across the entire grid, but rather a localized placement of values based on the first row/column. The code needs to have the mirroring constrained and zero out other non-zero cells.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Analysis:** Carefully examine *all* input/output pairs, not just the first one. Pay close attention to how individual non-zero pixels in the input relate to pixels in the output.\n2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML document with more precise observations. Focus on:\n    *   Identifying the *specific* conditions that trigger the mirroring (it's not the entire row/column, but very targeted).\n    *   Noting any pixels that *change* color (besides the mirroring operation) or are *removed*.\n    *  Confirm zero (white) preservation in all examples.\n3.  **Revise Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the program to accurately describe the *complete* transformation, incorporating the new observations. Be very specific about *which* pixels are mirrored and where they are placed. Use terms that precisely pinpoint locations (e.g., \"the first non-zero pixel in the top row,\" rather than just \"the top row\").\n4.  **Iterative Code Adjustment:** Based on the revised program, modify the Python code. Test *after each significant code change* against all training examples.\n\n**Metrics and Code Execution:**\n\nI'll use `code_execution` to get precise metrics on the provided examples:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_grid(grid, grid_name):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes a single grid and returns relevant metrics.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    non_zero_count = np.count_nonzero(grid)\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)\n    zero_count = (grid == 0).sum()\n\n    print(f\"--- {grid_name} Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"  Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}\")\n    print(f\"  Non-zero Pixels: {non_zero_count}\")\n    print(f\"  Zero Pixels: {zero_count}\")\n    print(f\"  Unique Colors: {unique_colors}\")\n\ndef compare_grids(input_grid, output_grid, predicted_grid):\n    \"\"\"Compares the output and predicted grids, highlighting discrepancies.\"\"\"\n    if output_grid.shape != predicted_grid.shape:\n        print(\"  ERROR: Output and Predicted grids have different shapes.\")\n        return\n\n    diff = output_grid != predicted_grid\n    num_diffs = np.sum(diff)\n\n    print(f\"  Differences between Output and Predicted: {num_diffs} pixels\")\n    if num_diffs > 0:\n      print(f\"  Coordinates of Differences: {list(zip(*np.where(diff)))}\")\n\n\n#Example grids provided below -

It correctly identifies the specific mirroring rule and the removal of other colors.\n"
