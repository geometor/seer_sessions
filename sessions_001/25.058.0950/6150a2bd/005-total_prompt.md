Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves transposing the input grid, effectively swapping rows and columns. If the original dimensions are (height, width), the new dimensions will be (width, height). The values at input_grid[y][x] will be at output_grid[x][y].
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transposes the input grid.

    Args:
        input_grid: A 2D list or numpy array representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A 2D list or numpy array representing the transposed output grid.
    """
    # Convert input to numpy array for easier manipulation
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Transpose the array
    output_array = np.transpose(input_array)

    # Convert back to list
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
