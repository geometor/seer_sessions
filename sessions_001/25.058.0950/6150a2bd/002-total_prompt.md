<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=444x434 at 0x71BED6FC60D0>Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output pairs and discern the transformation rule. Here's my report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of colored pixels, represented by integers. The input and output grids have the same dimensions in each example pair. The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid, and possibly some form of color/value preservation. The position and arrangement of colors change, but the set of colors present, and the general shape they make remain consistent within a transformation.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - observation: The colors (represented by integers) in the input grid are also present in the output grid.
  - observation: The relative positions of colors change between input and output.
  - observation: The transformation appears to be some form of grid rotation or mirroring.
  - subject: Grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (Example 1), 3x3 (Example 2)
      - content: 2D array of integers (0-9)
    actions:
      - rotated: The grid contents are rotated.
    relationships:
      - input_to_output: The input grid is transformed to the output grid by the rotation.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.

1.  **Input:** A 2D grid of integers (colors).
2.  **Process:** Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise. This involves:
    *   The top-left element of the input becomes the top-right element of the output.
    *   The top row of the input becomes the rightmost column of the output.
    *   The rightmost column of the input becomes the bottom row of the output (reversed).
    *   The bottom row of the input becomes the leftmost column of the output (reversed).
    *   The leftmost column of the input becomes the top row of the output.
3. **Output:** A 2D grid that is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the input grid.

This simple, clear, and effective description is the core information I want to remember for the next step.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
