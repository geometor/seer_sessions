            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the rotation code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program described a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, and the code implemented this using `np.rot90`. The results indicate that this transformation is correct for all provided training examples. Since the code correctly handles all given examples, there are no errors. The general approach and code were excellent.\n\nMy strategy is, as instructed, to provide:\n\n1.  Metrics about each example.\n2.  A YAML block documenting observations (objects, properties, actions).\n3.  A refined natural language program.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Shape: 3x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x3\n    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.\n    *    Result: correct\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Shape: 5x3\n    *   Output Shape: 3x5\n    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.\n    *    Result: correct\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Shape: 7x7\n    *   Output Shape: 7x7\n    *   Transformation: 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The code correctly rotated all the cells and colors.\n        *    Result: correct\n\n**YAML Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - task: 00d62c1b\n    examples:\n      - example_1:\n        input_grid_shape: 3x3\n        output_grid_shape: 3x3\n        objects:\n          - description: Entire grid\n            properties:\n              - shape: input_grid_shape\n              - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n            actions:\n              - name: rotate_90_ccw\n                result: output_grid\n      - example_2:\n          input_grid_shape: 5x3\n          output_grid_shape: 3x5\n          objects:\n            - description: Entire grid\n              properties:\n                - shape: input_grid_shape\n                - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n              actions:\n                - name: rotate_90_ccw\n                  result: output_grid\n      - example_3:\n          input_grid_shape: 7x7\n          output_grid_shape: 7x7\n          objects:\n            - description: Entire grid\n              properties:\n                - shape: input_grid_shape\n                - rotation: 90 degrees counter-clockwise\n              actions:\n                - name: rotate_90_ccw\n                  result: output_grid\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to produce the output grid. Each pixel in the input grid retains its original color/value and is repositioned according to the 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation. The dimensions of the output grid are determined by the rotation of the input grid.\n"
