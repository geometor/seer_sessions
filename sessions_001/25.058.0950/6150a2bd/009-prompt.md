Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the 3x3 grid. Each element in the input grid is moved to its new position in the output grid as if the entire grid were rotated. The values/colors of the individual cells are preserved, only their position changes.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input array.
    output_array = np.copy(input_array)
    
    # use numpys built in rot90 function
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=1) # k=1 for 90-degree CCW rotation


    return output_array.tolist() # convert back

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
