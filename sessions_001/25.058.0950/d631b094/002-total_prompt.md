**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another, typically smaller, grid. The key element seems to be the presence of non-zero values within the input grid. The output grid appears to be a condensed representation, focusing solely on the non-zero values and their respective colors, discarding the zero-valued (white) cells. The number of non-zero pixels in the input seems to dictate the dimensions of the output.

**YAML Fact Identification:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: object
    description: input grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3, 3x3, 3x3, 3x3)
      - values: integers 0-9
      - colors: corresponds to values (white, blue, red, orange, azure)

  - type: object
    description: output grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable, related to the count of non-zero pixels in the input.
      - values: integers 0-9 (same as input, excluding 0)
      - colors: corresponds to values (same color mapping as input)
  - type: action
    description: filtering
    details: removing all 0-valued (white) cells.
  - type: action
    description: condensing
    details: arranging the remaining non-zero colored cells into a new grid.

  - type: relationship
    description: input-output value correspondence
    details: Non-zero values in the input grid are preserved in the output grid, maintaining their original color.

  - type: relationship
    description: output dimension determination
    details: dimensions are derived from the count of non-zero pixels in the input
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-zero pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Count** the number of non-zero pixels.
3. **Create output**:
    *   If there is one non-zero pixel make output a 1 x 1 grid.
    *   If there are two, make a 1 x 2 grid
    *   If there are three, a 1 x 3 grid.
    *    If four, a 1 x 4 grid.
4. **Populate Output**:
   *   Fill the output grid with the non-zero values, preserving the original colors.
   * Each value is place in the output from left to right.
5.  **Discard** all zero-valued (white) pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
