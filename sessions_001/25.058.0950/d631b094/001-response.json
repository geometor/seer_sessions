The key element seems to be the presence of non-zero values within the input grid. The output grid appears to be a condensed representation, focusing solely on the non-zero values and their respective colors, discarding the zero-valued (white) cells. The number of non-zero pixels in the input seems to dictate the dimensions of the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
