**Perception of Task Elements**

*   **Input:** Two rows of colored squares (pixels). Each row has the same number of squares, and all squares within a row are the same color. The two rows have different colors.
*   **Output:** Two rows of colored squares, where the colors alternate between the two colors present in the input. The top-left square of the output has the same color as the top row of the input. The dimensions (number of rows and columns) remain constant.

**YAML Block (Facts)**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 2 x N  # N is the number of columns, which is consistent
      rows:
        - row_index: 0
          elements: [ color_1 ] * N
        - row_index: 1
          elements: [ color_2 ] * N

actions:
  - name: alternate_colors
    input: grid
    output: grid
    description: >
      Creates a new grid with the same dimensions.
      The colors of the pixels in the new grid alternate between color_1 and color_2.
      The alternation pattern begins with color_1 in the top-left pixel.

relationships:
    - input grid rows map to alternating pattern in output grid
    - color_1 and color_2 remain the same
    -  grid dimensions are unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input:** Take a 2xN grid where the first row is a single color (color_1) and the second row is a different single color (color_2).

2.  **Process:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions (2xN). Fill the new grid by alternating colors as follows:
    *   Row 1, Column 1: color\_1
    *   Row 1, Column 2: color\_2
    *   Row 1, Column 3: color\_1
    *  ... continue alternating
    *   Row 2, Column 1: color\_2
    *   Row 2, Column 2: color\_1
    *   Row 2, Column 3: color\_2
    * ... continue alternating

3.  **Output:** Return the new 2xN grid with alternating colors. The alternation in the first row starts with the original first row color. The alternation in the second row starts with the original second row color.

In essence, the transformation takes the two input rows and interleaves their colors column by column in the output grid, creating a checkerboard-like pattern within each row, and ensuring corresponding positions on different rows have different colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
