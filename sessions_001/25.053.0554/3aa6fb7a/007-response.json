All of them are variations of a three-pixel L shape.\n\n2.  **Locate Changed Pixel within Each Object:**\n    *   For the standard L shape in the top-right, consider the pixels from top-right to bottom-left.  The second pixel in this sequence changes.\n    *   For the up-side-down-L in the middle-left, consider the pixels in sequence from top to bottom. The second pixel in this sequence changes.\n    *    For the mirrored L in the bottom center, consider the direction from right to left, the second pixel in that sequence changes.\n\n3.  **Change Color:**  Change the color of the identified pixel in each object from azure (8) to blue (1).\n\nThe core transformation rule is consistent: one specific azure pixel in each *L-shaped* object is changed to blue. The selection of *which* azure pixel is based on a consistent 'second pixel' rule, but the direction considered for 'second' depends on the orientation of the L shape itself.\n"
