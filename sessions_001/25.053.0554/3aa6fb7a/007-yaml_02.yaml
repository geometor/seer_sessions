facts:
  - observation: "The input and output grids are 7x7."
  - object_identification: "There are three distinct objects in the input grid, all composed of azure (8) pixels."
  - object_1: "One object is an L shape of three azure pixels, on the top-right side."
  - object_2: "Another object is an L shape of three azure pixels in the center-left."
  - object_3: "A final object is a reversed L shape of three azure pixels, in the bottom-center"
  - change_detection: "One pixel in each of the three L shaped object has changed to blue (1) in the output grid."
  - position_analysis_obj1: "In the first L shape, the second azure pixel from top right to bottom left has changed."
  - position_analysis_obj2: "In the second object, a vertical L shape, the second pixel from top to bottom changes to blue."
  - position_analysis_obj3: "For the third object, a horizontal mirrored L shape. The second element from right to left and top to bottom changes to blue."
  - overall_transformation: "One azure pixel changes to blue in each object, and this specific position is the main transformation. The rule for locating this position changes slightly based on object orientation, but is always the 'second' pixel in a meaningful sequence."
