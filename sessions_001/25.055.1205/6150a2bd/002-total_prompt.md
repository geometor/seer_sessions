## Example 1

**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74465FC70460>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x74465FC71990>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, representing colors. The transformation between the input and output grid appears to involve a rotation. The colors/numbers themselves seem to be preserved, but their positions change. It's not a simple reflection across an axis, as the relative positions change.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single_digit_integers
    element_type: color_codes
  - observation: color_values_preserved: true
    description: The set of colors in the input is the same as the set of colors in the output.
  - transformation: rotation
    degrees: 180 #likely rotation - either 90 CW twice or 90 CCW twice
    axis: center #rotation is around center of the object
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the input grid as a single object.
2.  **Rotate** the entire grid by 180 degrees around its center point.
3.  **Output** the rotated grid. This maintains the original colors, but repositions all the color by the 180 degreee rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
