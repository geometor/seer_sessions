# Example

**input:**
```
1 0 0 5 0 1 0
0 1 0 5 1 1 1
1 0 0 5 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x192 at 0x7745EA797400>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 2 0
0 0 0
```

Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and proposed transformation rule for the example input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A rectangular grid of colored pixels. The colors present are blue (1), white (0), and gray (5). There's a prominent vertical gray stripe in the center. Blue and white pixels appear on either side.
*   **Output:** A smaller rectangular grid. It contains only white (0) and red (2) pixels. The red pixel is located at the center.
*   **Transformation:** It seems like the transformation extracts a central 3x3 region, and the color of central pixel within it depends on a specific part of the original input grid.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [blue, white, gray]
      dimensions: [3, 7]  # Height, Width
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [white, red]
      dimensions: [3, 3]
  - object: gray_stripe
    type: object
    properties:
        color: gray
        location: vertical center
        role: reference
  - action: extract_center
    input: input_grid
    parameters: [3,3] # size of center region
    output: intermediate_grid
  - action: determine_center_color
    input: intermediate_grid
    logic: "if the sum of the blue pixels in input is greater than 2, then output is red in center, else output is white."
    output: output_grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Feature:** Locate the vertical gray stripe (all pixels with color value 5) running down the center of the input grid.
2. **Extract Central Region:** Consider a 3x3 sub-grid centered on the overall input.
3. Count the blue pixels in the input
4. **Determine Center Color** If the count of blue pixel is greater than 2. Set output central pixel color to be red (2)
5. Fill all other pixels in the output with color value white (0).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
