The input grid contains the values 0, 1, and 5, corresponding to white, blue, and gray. The output grid contains values 0 and 2, corresponding to white and red. The output grid seems to be derived from the input by focusing on a specific color (blue, represented by 1 in the input) and its surrounding area and replacing it with a different color (red, represented by 2 in the output) at specific locations. It is clear that the central column of 5s in input are ignored completely.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
