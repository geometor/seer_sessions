# Example

**input:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=448x448 at 0x7745ED017310>

**output:**
```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 8 1 0 0 0 0
0 8 8 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 8 0
0 0 0 0 1 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially with values of 0 (white) and 8 (azure). The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the 8 (azure) pixels to 1 (blue) based on their position and adjacency. The overall grid dimensions remain constant.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - azure (8)
        - blue (1)
      position: [row, column]
    relations:
      adjacency:
        - neighbors: list of adjacent pixels

actions:
  - name: change_color
    preconditions:
      - object.color == azure (8)
      - specific positional/adjacency rule (to be determined)
    postconditions:
      - object.color == blue (1)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find all pixels with the color azure (8).
2.  **Check Neighbors** Inspect each identified azure pixel
    *   check the pixel one up and one down.
3.  **Transform:**
    *   Change exactly one of the identified azure pixels to blue, specifically the pixel, that is in the middle vertically, and closest to the top, to the value 1 (blue).

In summary form:
Change the uppermost central azure pixel to blue.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
