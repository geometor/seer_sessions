            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the resulting code captured some aspects of the transformation but failed to generalize correctly across all examples. The primary issue is that the code is too specific to the initial example and doesn't fully account for the movement and combination rules implied across the entire training set. The code correctly identifies and moves the maroon pixel, but the logic for combining the azure pixels and moving other colored pixels needs to be refined. It seems there is vertical movement of colored blocks.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully review the input, expected output, and transformed output for each example. Note the discrepancies and identify patterns in how the code's logic deviates from the expected behavior. Metrics for each example input size, color palette, counts for each color, and other information.\n2.  **Refine Object Identification:** The current code treats individual pixels. Instead consider \"objects\" which are contiguous blocks of the same color.\n3.  **Update Movement Rules:** Re-evaluate the conditions under which colors are moved or combined. The rule isn't just about azure pixels stacked on top of each other, but appears to consider how to compress all objects to the bottom.\n4.  **Iterative Refinement:** Update the natural language program and code, then re-test on all training examples. Repeat this process until the code accurately transforms all training inputs to their expected outputs.\n\n**Metrics and Observations from Examples:**\n\nHere is the information about each of the examples.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 4x4\n*   **Color Palette:** 0, 1, 4, 6, 9\n*   **Color Counts:**\n    *   0: 11\n    *   1: 1\n    *   4: 2\n    *   6: 1\n    *   9: 1\n*    **Observations**: The transformation moves non-zero color pixels to bottom rows, preserving column positions.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 6x6\n*   **Color Palette:** 0, 4, 7, 8, 9\n*   **Color Counts:**\n    *   0: 29\n    *   4: 3\n    *   7: 2\n    *   8: 2\n    *   9: 1\n*    **Observations**: Two azure (8) pixels in the same column. Lower one maintained, upper one is cleared. The single maroon (9) moves down.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   **Input Size:** 5x5\n*   **Color Palette:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 6\n*   **Color Counts:**\n    *   0: 18\n    *   1: 2\n    *   2: 1\n    *   3: 3\n    *   6: 1\n\n*    **Observations**: All colored blocks move down, keeping their columns.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: maroon_pixel\n    color: 9\n    behavior: moves to the bottom row, maintaining column\n  - name: azure_pixels\n    color: 8\n    behavior: vertically stacked instances consolidate to the lower cell, maintaining columns\n  - name: other_colored_pixels\n    colors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]\n    behavior: move downwards, maintaining original columns, stacking on the bottom-most available row, or on top of other objects.\n\nactions:\n  - name: move_down\n    description: Objects move to the lowest available row in their original column.\n  - name: consolidate\n    description:  If multiple objects of the same color are stacked vertically, they merge into the lowest occupied position.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero (colored) pixels. These are our \"objects.\"\n2.  For each column, starting from the bottom row and moving upwards, iterate through the identified objects.\n3.  Move each object downwards as far as possible within its original column, stopping when it hits the bottom of the grid or another object. If multiple instances of an object of the same color exist, stack vertically, merging from top down.\n4.  Empty/white (0) cells remain empty.\n\n"
