  - input_objects:
      - description: "Pixels of color red (2) or blue (1)"
        properties:
          color: [red, blue]
          shape: "single pixel"
  - actions:
      - description: "Expand red pixels vertically"
        properties:
          color: yellow (4)

          shape: "line"
      - description: "Expand blue pixels into crosses"
        properties:
          color: orange (7)
          direction: "horizontal and vertical"
          shape: "cross"
  - constraints:
