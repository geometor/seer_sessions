The input grid contains a seemingly random scattering of single, non-white, non-black pixels (blue, red, azure). The output grid introduces new orange and yellow pixels, and some pixels from the input grid seem to maintain their original color and position. The introduction of the new colors appears to be related to the positions of existing colors in the input, indicating a possible interaction, dependency, or communication between the input pixels.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

One to the left and one to the right, or one above and one below relative to the original pair.\n5. **Orange Filling** Fill the three by three area including the original pair with orange (7).\n6.  **Preservation:** Any non-white pixels from the input grid that *do not* participate in a 3-distance relationship with another pixel, are copied to the output grid unchanged.\n\nI believe this captures the transformation logic accurately. The core concept is the identification of specific pixel pairs that meet the distance 3 apart criteria, and then creation of specific shapes of colors based on those pairs. The output grid will have a combination of these generated colors and the original input pixels that are not used for creating new pixels.\n"
