Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The primary element is a recognizable shape formed by gray (5) pixels in the input grid. This shape seems to be the focus of the transformation. The output grid retains the overall structure and dimensions of the input grid, but the gray shape is altered. Specifically, the gray pixels are replaced with a combination of azure (8) and red (2) pixels. The azure pixels appear to trace the outline of the original gray shape, while the red pixels fill the interior. The background (white, 0) remains unchanged.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - background_color: white (0)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - background_color: white (0)
  - object: shape
    type: contiguous block
    properties:
      - input_color: gray (5)
      - output_outline_color: azure (8)
      - output_fill_color: red (2)
      - shape_type:  appears to be a simplified "B" or a stylized "8"

  - action: transform
    description: The input grid is transformed into the output grid.
    details:
      - The gray shape is replaced.
      - The outline of the shape is changed to azure.
      - The interior of the shape is changed to red.
      - background is unchanged

  - relationship: grid_correspondence
    description: The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Shape:** Locate the contiguous block of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. This constitutes the shape to be transformed.

2.  **Outline the Shape:** Replace the outermost layer of gray pixels that have at least one adjancent background, with azure (8) pixels. This forms the outline of the shape in the output.

3.  **Fill the Shape:** Change any remaining inner gray(5) cells to the color red(2) filling the outlined shape.

4. **Preserve Background**: All white (0) background pixels in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
