"""
1.  **Identify** the contiguous shape formed by gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve** all pixels with the color white (0) in their original positions in the output grid.
3.  **Create** a new shape, colored red (2). This shape will be the leftmost vertical line of the original gray.
4.  **Create** a second shape, colored azure(8). This starts from the immediate right of the red shape and extends the same shape, but shifted.
5. **Place** these new color shapes in the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
