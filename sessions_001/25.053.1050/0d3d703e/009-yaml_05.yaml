objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: determined by integer value based on a predefined color map

actions:
  - type: value_mapping
    description: Each integer in the input is replaced by a corresponding integer in the output.
    details: >
        The mapping is consistent across all cells in the grid, but is not identity (i.e, the numbers change)

relationships:
  - type: spatial_invariance
    description: The position of each element remains constant during the transformation.
  - type: one-to-one_mapping
    description: there appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between input numbers and output numbers
