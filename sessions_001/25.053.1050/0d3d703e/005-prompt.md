Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program performs a direct substitution of each pixel's value based on a mapping specific to each example. The mapping isn't consistent across all examples; it must be determined separately for each input/output pair.

1.  **Determine the Example-Specific Mapping:** For each example, create a mapping by comparing corresponding pixel values in the input and output grids.
2.  **Apply the Mapping:** For every pixel in the input grid, find its corresponding replacement value in the example-specific mapping and replace it in the output grid.
3.  Output is the resulting grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
