The input grid contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3, corresponding to blue, red, and green colors, respectively. The output grid contains the numbers 4, 5, and 6, which represent yellow, gray, and magenta. The spatial arrangement of the numbers/colors remains identical; only the values themselves are changed. The transformation appears to be a simple mapping or substitution of each number with a new number.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
