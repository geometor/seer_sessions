task_description: |
  The task involves a color substitution.  Each color in the input grid is consistently replaced with a corresponding color in the output grid.  The spatial arrangement of the pixels remains unchanged; only the color values are altered. The substitution is specific to each example.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_colors: [3, 1, 2]
      output_colors: [4, 5, 6]
      substitution: {3: 4, 1: 5, 2: 6}
      grid_size: 3x3
  - example_2:
      input_colors: [2, 3, 8]
      output_colors: [6, 4, 9]
      substitution: {2: 6, 3: 4, 8: 9}
      grid_size: 3x3
  - example_3:
      input_colors: [5, 8, 6]
      output_colors: [1, 9, 2]
      substitution: {5: 1, 8: 9, 6: 2}
      grid_size: 3x3
  - example_4:
      input_colors: [9, 4, 2]
      output_colors: [8, 3, 6]
      substitution: {9: 8, 4: 3, 2: 6}
      grid_size: 3x3

objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3 (all examples)
      elements: pixels (integers representing colors)

actions:
  - name: color_substitution
    description:  Each pixel's color value in the input grid is replaced by a new color value according to an example-specific mapping.  The position of the pixel does not change.
