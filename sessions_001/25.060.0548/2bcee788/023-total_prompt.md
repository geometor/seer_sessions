Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Background Change:** Change all background (white/0) pixels in the input grid to green (3) pixels in the output grid.
2. **Copy azure object:** The azure object of three adjacent pixels in a horizontal line is maintained.
3. **Extend azure:** The initial azure shape is extended downward by two pixels, resulting in an L shape, or the inverse of an L, depending on perspective.
4.  **Remove Red Pixel:** The single red pixel in the input is not present, or it transforms to green matching the background.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
