      input:
        object_type: contiguous_block
        object_colors: [2, 7]
        background_color: 0
      output:
        object_color: 7

        transformation: >
            All pixels of 2 become 7. All 7 pixels expand by one cell to
            up and right. Background changes to 3. Overlapping expansion results in a single
            pixel of color 7.
  - example_2:
    input:
        object_type: contiguous_block
        object_colors: [2, 7]
        background_color: 0
    output:
        object_color: 7
        background_color: 3
        transformation: >
            All pixels of 2 become 7. All 7 pixels expand by one cell to
            up and right. Background changes to 3.

    input:
        object_type: contiguous_block
        object_colors: [2, 7]
        background_color: 0
    output:

        background_color: 3
        transformation: >
            All pixels of 2 become 7. All 7 pixels expand by one cell
            up and right. Background changes to 3.
