Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** Grids of varying colors, with a focus on colored shapes against a background of 0 (white).
*   **Output:** Similar grids, but the background is consistently 3 (green). The non-background colored shapes in the input seem to be "filled in" or made more solid, and potentially one of the colors within the shape are changed, and other are removed.
*  The shapes transform, and background is added

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of pixels.
    elements:
      - colors: integers 0-9, representing different colors.
      - background: Initially 0 (white) in input, becomes 3 (green) in output.
  - type: object
    description: Colored shapes within the grid.
    properties:
      - color: Non-zero color value.
      - shape: Can be irregular.
    actions:
      - fill: Interior empty spaces (0s) within the shape's outline are filled with a color, if there is one.
      - color_change: One of the original colors within the shape becomes the dominant color
      - color_removal: colors other than the dominant are removed.
  - type: background
    properties:
      - color: 3 (green).
    actions:
      - creation: added to the entire grid, except the transformed object.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous regions (objects) of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Dominant Color:** within each object, find one of the existing colors.
3.  **Fill:** If there is a dominant color within an object, fill the shape to remove all pixels not of the dominant color.
4. **Create background:** create a grid the same size as the input, color everything green (3).
5.  **Overlay Shape:** set the pixels of the changed object in the background grid, replacing the background color.
