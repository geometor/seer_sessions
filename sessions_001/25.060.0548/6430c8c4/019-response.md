Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger, more complex grid (input) into a smaller, simpler grid (output). The input grid contains multiple colored regions (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation, primarily using the color green (3) and white (0). The input seems to have distinct rectangular blocks of color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 9x4 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Output grid is 4x4 (rows x columns).
  - observation: Input grid contains colors: orange (7), yellow (4), red (2), and white (0).
  - observation: Output grid contains colors: green (3) and white (0).
  - object: Input grid regions
    properties:
      - color: Varies (0, 2, 4, 7)
      - shape: Rectangular
  - object: Output grid regions
      properties:
      - color: green (3) or white (0)
      - shape: mostly 1x1, some are potentially larger
  - action: count_non_zero_blocks
  - action: condense or simplify
    details: The input grid appears to be summarized or reduced in the output grid.
  - relationship: output_size smaller_than input_size
  - relationship: output_colors different_than input_colors, possibly a single new one

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Distinct Colored Regions:** Divide the input grid into distinct, contiguous rectangular blocks of the same color.
2.  **Count the regions:** In the input, count them. There are four.
3. **Create an output grid**: Create an output grid where a cell contains green if an input block exists, and the remaining cells are white.

Based on this, It seems the colors 7, 4, and, 2 becomes green when an area is occupied.
