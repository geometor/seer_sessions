facts:
  - observation: |
      Each example input consists of one or more distinct shapes, where a shape is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
  - observation: |
      The background color is always black (0).
  - observation: |
      Across all examples, the color of each shape in the input is consistently transformed to a different, specific color in the output.
  - observation: |
      The shape and size of the object is consistent in the input and output grids.
  - observation: |
       The shape in the input grid is the same shape in the output grid, only the color is changed.
  - transformation_rule: |
      The transformation involves changing the color of each shape while preserving its location, size and geometry.
