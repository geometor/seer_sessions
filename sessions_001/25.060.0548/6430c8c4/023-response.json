            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved creating a diagonal representation of contiguous, non-white blocks. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally. The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example, assuming a diagonal relationship where one might not exist. The provided results and the initial description are included below.\n\nThe strategy to address this is to:\n\n1.  **Re-examine the examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair to identify common patterns or rules that apply across all examples, not just the first.\n2.  **Focus on object properties:** Pay close attention to the properties of the identified objects (blocks), such as their color, size, position, and their relationship to other objects.\n3.  **Generalize the transformation:** Instead of assuming a specific diagonal relationship, look for more general rules that govern how the input objects are represented in the output. The relationship between blocks, other than \"is the same color\" from the function `find_blocks`, isn't yet considered.\n4. **Simplify output:** It is also important to recognize that the outputs could be simplified - the prompt and initial responses have a strong bias toward the first training sample.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example and the results of the current code:\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_blocks(grid):\n    \"\"\"Find contiguous blocks of the same color (excluding white/0).\"\"\"\n    blocks = []\n    visited = set()\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    def dfs(row, col, color, block):\n        if (row, col) in visited or row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols or grid[row, col] != color:\n            return\n        visited.add((row, col))\n        block.append((row, col))\n        dfs(row + 1, col, color, block)\n        dfs(row - 1, col, color, block)\n        dfs(row, col + 1, color, block)\n        dfs(row, col - 1, color, block)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if (r, c) not in visited and grid[r,c] != 0:\n                block = []\n                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], block)\n                blocks.append(block)\n    return blocks\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Find blocks in the input grid\n    blocks = find_blocks(np.array(input_grid))\n    num_blocks = len(blocks)\n\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros, with dimensions based on the number of blocks.\n    output_grid = np.zeros((num_blocks, num_blocks), dtype=int)\n\n    # Place a 'green' (3) pixel on the diagonal for each block.\n    for i in range(num_blocks):\n        output_grid[i, i] = 3\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)\nexamples = [\n    {\n        \"input\": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]],\n        \"output\": [[3]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\n        \"output\": [[3]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\n        \"output\": [[3]]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\" : [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]],\n        \"output\" : [[3]]\n    }\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(examples):\n    input_grid = example[\"input\"]\n    expected_output = example[\"output\"]\n    actual_output = transform(input_grid)\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    print(f\"  Input:\\n{np.array(input_grid)}\")\n    print(f\"  Expected Output:\\n{np.array(expected_output)}\")\n    print(f\"  Actual Output:\\n{actual_output}\")\n    print(f\"  Matches Expected: {np.array_equal(actual_output, np.array(expected_output))}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n```"
