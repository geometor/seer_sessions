Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 9x4 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid. The input grid contains a variety of colors (represented by digits 0, 2, 4, and 7), while the output grid contains only two colors (0 and 3). The output seems to focus on the corners of the input grid, somehow extracting a sub-grid. The colors in the input do not appear directly in the output, suggesting a color transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x4
    elements: [0, 2, 4, 7]
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements: [0, 3]
  - name: corner_subgrid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 4x4

actions:
  - name: extract_subgrid
    input: input_grid
    output: corner_subgrid
    description: Extracts the 4x4 subgrid from the top-left corner, using the dimension of original colored-object.
  - name: transform_color
    input: corner_subgrid
    output: output_grid
    description: Transforms the colors of the subgrid. The colors are defined by checking if they are on the top-left section of the input grid, and if so, make those greens.

relationships:
  - relationship: subgrid_of
    subject: corner_subgrid
    object: input_grid
  - relationship: transformed_to
    subject: corner_subgrid
    object: output_grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Extract Subgrid:** Identify the dimensions of the upper-left colored object composed by same-colored contiguous cells. From the input grid, extract the 4x4 subgrid from the top-left corner of input.
2.  **Transform Colors:**
    *   If an orange (7) pixel is present in the original input, set the cells with relative coordinates to green(3), else it's a white cell(0).

In essence the logic finds the orange colored section, then it replaces orange color with green, and rest with white. And select only a 4x4 area.
