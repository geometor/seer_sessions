The input grid contains various colors (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified or summarized version of the input, containing far fewer non-zero pixels.  The output grid is also significantly smaller in dimension. The spatial relationship between objects in the input grid seems to be relevant to the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The selection process is unknown but we can create a hypothesis:\n    - the upper-left 2x2 block of orange (7s) are \"reduced\" to the green pixel (3) in the upper-right corner of the output\n    - the two orange (7s) on the upper-right are reduced to green pixel (3) in the upper-left corner of the output\n\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a smaller, output grid.\n\n4.  **Populate Output:** Place the selected representative colors/pixels into the output grid at specific, potentially corresponding, locations. The logic defining output locations is currently unclear but related to the coordinates of input regions.\n\n5. **Zero out the Rest:** set all other pixels to zero.\n\nIn summary, the transformation appears to involve a non-trivial process of region detection, representative pixel/color selection, and placement into a smaller output grid, where the rule is not obvious and may be related to some absolute positional shift.\n"
