Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves identifying the positions of contiguous, non-white blocks in the input grid and creating a new grid where 'green' (3) pixels represent the relative diagonal position of these blocks. The output grid's dimensions are determined by the number of blocks found. If there are 'n' blocks, the output grid is an 'n x n' grid. Each block's relative position in the sequence of detected blocks corresponds to its diagonal index in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved creating a diagonal representation of contiguous, non-white blocks. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule doesn't hold universally. The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example, assuming a diagonal relationship where one might not exist. The provided results and the initial description are included below.

The strategy to address this is to:

1.  **Re-examine the examples:** Carefully analyze each input-output pair to identify common patterns or rules that apply across all examples, not just the first.
2.  **Focus on object properties:** Pay close attention to the properties of the identified objects (blocks), such as their color, size, position, and their relationship to other objects.
3.  **Generalize the transformation:** Instead of assuming a specific diagonal relationship, look for more general rules that govern how the input objects are represented in the output. The relationship between blocks, other than "is the same color" from the function `find_blocks`, isn't yet considered.
4. **Simplify output:** It is also important to recognize that the outputs could be simplified - the prompt and initial responses have a strong bias toward the first training sample.

**Metrics and Observations**

Here's a breakdown of each example and the results of the current code:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
