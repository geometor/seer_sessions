The output grids are consistently smaller (4x4) and contain only two colors: green and white. The green color (value 3) in the output seems to correspond to the orange color (value 7) in the input. The spatial arrangement of the green pixels in the output seems to be related to a compressed representation of the orange pixels within the input. White regions match zeros.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If a quadrant contains any orange, the compressed cell in that area will be green.\n4.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill all other cells in the output grid with white (0). The specific method of compression is to check if *any* orange pixel exists within each corresponding region of the input grid that maps to a single pixel in the 4x4 output.\n\nIn Essence, the output is 4x4 representation of input. Orange in the input, represented by 7, are areas of interest. The output grid, marks with color green (3) the areas with orange. All other input colors are discarded.\n"
