Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is compressed into a 4x4 output grid. If any orange (7) pixels are present in the region of the input grid corresponding to a cell in the output grid, that output cell is colored green (3). Otherwise, the output cell is colored white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape
    output_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)

    # Calculate the size of the regions in the input grid
    height_step = input_height / 4
    width_step = input_width / 4

    # Iterate through each cell of the output grid
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(4):
            # Define the boundaries of the corresponding region in the input grid
            start_row = int(i * height_step)
            end_row = int((i + 1) * height_step)
            start_col = int(j * width_step)
            end_col = int((j + 1) * width_step)

            # Extract the region from the input grid
            region = input_grid[start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col]

            # Check if any orange (7) pixel is present in the region
            if 7 in region:
                output_grid[i, j] = 3  # Set to green
            else:
                output_grid[i, j] = 0  # Set to white

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of testing the initial code against all training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified rule. While the code correctly handles the first example, it fails to generalize to other cases where the presence of orange (7) doesn't dictate the output in a simple 4x4 compression. The core issue is that the initial program assumes a fixed 4x4 output grid and a direct correspondence between input regions and output cells based solely on the presence of orange. The additional examples demonstrate more complex relationships and potentially different output grid sizes.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, paying close attention to the size of both grids, the placement of colors, and any potential patterns.
2.  **Identify Key Features:** Determine the relevant features that influence the transformation. This may include the presence, absence, count, or position of specific colors. It might also involve identifying shapes, patterns or object interactions.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to accurately capture the transformation rule observed across *all* training examples.
4. **Generate new code based on updated program**
5.  **Iterate:** Test the refined program against the examples and repeat the process until all training examples are correctly handled.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately analyze, I'll use a conceptual approach (since I can't directly execute code) to describe what code execution *would* do and the expected results.

*Example 1*

*   Input Size: 16x16
*   Output Size: 4x4
*   Result: Success. The code correctly identifies orange and maps regions to green.
*   metrics report:
    ```
    example: 1
    input_shape: (16, 16)
    output_shape: (4, 4)
    output_shape_match: False
    orange_in_input: True
    green_in_output: True
    transformation_type: compression
    success: True
    ```

*Example 2*

*   Input Size: 14x14
*   Output Size: 14x14.
*   Result: Fail. Output is 4x4, where it must match the dimensions of input.
*   metrics report:
    ```
    example: 2
    input_shape: (14, 14)
    output_shape: (14, 14)
    output_shape_match: True
    orange_in_input: True
    green_in_output: True
    transformation_type: conditional_replacement
    success: False
    ```

*Example 3*

*   Input Size: 16x16
*   Output Size: 16x16.
*   Result: Fail. Output is 4x4, but it should maintain the original size.
*   metrics report:
    ```
    example: 3
    input_shape: (16, 16)
    output_shape: (16, 16)
    output_shape_match: True
    orange_in_input: True
    green_in_output: True
    transformation_type: conditional_replacement
    success: False
    ```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: (16, 16)
      output_shape: (4, 4)
      transformation: "Compression. Output is 4x4. If orange (7) is present in a corresponding input region, the output cell is green (3); otherwise, it's white (0)."
      objects:
        - color: orange (7)
          role: "Conditional trigger"
        - color: green (3)
          role: "Output based on orange presence"
        - color: white (0)
          role: default output color

  - example_2:
      input_shape: (14, 14)
      output_shape: (14, 14)
      transformation: "Conditional replacement.  Every orange (7) pixel in the input is changed to green(3) in the output. The size of output is the same as input"
      objects:
        - color: orange (7)
          role: "Target for replacement"
        - color: green (3)
            role: replace orange
  - example_3:
      input_shape: (16, 16)
      output_shape: (16, 16)
      transformation: "Conditional replacement.  Every orange (7) pixel in the input is changed to green(3) in the output. The size of output is the same as input"
      objects:
        - color: orange (7)
          role: "Target for replacement"
        - color: green (3)
            role: replace orange
```

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid. Every orange (7) pixel in the input grid is replaced by a green (3) pixel in the output grid. All other pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
