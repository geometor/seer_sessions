The output is a 4x4 grid, also of single-digit integers, using a subset of the input colors. The output grid appears to be a simplified or abstracted version of a section of the input grid, focusing on specific colors and their arrangement. Specifically, it appears there is a diagonal relationship.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
