The input and output grids have the same dimensions (18x18). The most striking feature is the replacement of a specific pattern of 0s in the input with non-zero numbers corresponding to the surrounding pattern in the output. There appears to be a repeating sub-grid or pattern, and some kind of \"filling in\" or \"propagation\" of values.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

These form the region to be replaced.\n\n3.  **Determine Replacement Strategy:** For the example, within the first repeating region, starting at coordinates (0,0) and continuing to (7,7), the output replicates the pattern, filling pixels where there are zeros.\n\n4.  **Fill the Zeros:** For *every* 0 in the input grid:\n    *   Its coordinates (x, y) within the *entire* input grid are used.\n\n    * Use those coordinates in the 7x7 pattern to fill in the repeating sub-grid.\n\n5.
