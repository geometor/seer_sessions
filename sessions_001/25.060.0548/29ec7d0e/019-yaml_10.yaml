facts:
  - task: "Identify and replicate a repeating pattern to construct the output grid."
  - example_1:
      input_shape: [14, 14]
      output_shape: [14, 14]
      pattern_size: [7, 7]
      pattern_origin: "top-left corner of input"
      result: "correct"
  - example_2:
      input_shape: [7, 7]
      output_shape: [21, 21]
      pattern_size: [7, 7]
      pattern_origin: "top-left corner of input"
      result: "incorrect - output size mismatch"
  - example_3:
      input_shape: [10, 10]
      output_shape: [14, 14]
      pattern_size: [7,7]
      pattern_origin: "top-left corner of the input"
      result: "incorrect - output size mismatch, pattern replication incomplete"
  - repeating_unit:
      description: "A 7x7 grid extracted from the top-left corner of the input grid."
      size: [7, 7]
  - output_construction:
      method: "The output grid is constructed by repeating the repeating unit."
      size_relation: "The output grid's dimensions are independent from input, but are multiples of the repeating unit size."
