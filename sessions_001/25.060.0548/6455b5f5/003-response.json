The input grid consists primarily of white (0) and red (2) pixels.  The red pixels form a distinct shape, possibly resembling a stylized \"T\" or cross. The output grid introduces two new colors: azure (8) and blue (1). The azure appears to \"highlight\" certain points. The blue fills the lower, previously blank section, adjacent to the bottom of the existing shape.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
