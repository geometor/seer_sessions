Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Red Lines:** Identify the single vertical and single horizontal red lines in the input grid. Note that one or the other might not exist. The lines will consist of contiguous cells of color red (2).
2.  **Background Fill:** Change all white (0) background pixels to blue (1).
3.  **Azure Fill (Conditional):**
    *   If a vertical red line exists:
        *   Fill the three columns immediately to the left of the vertical red line with azure (8). Only fill cells that are *not* part of a horizontal red line.
        *   Fill the three columns immediately to the right of the vertical red line with azure (8). Only fill cells that are *not* part of a horizontal red line.
    *   If there is no horizontal red line, proceed with the azure fill on both sides of the vertical line.
4. If any ambiguities occur (multiple potential vertical or horizontal lines) prioritize consistent results.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved a vertical red line and azure filling around it. The subsequent training examples reveal that the horizontal red line also plays a crucial role, and the azure filling is dependent on *both* the vertical and horizontal lines. The core issue is that the initial program oversimplified the filling rule. Instead of only excluding the horizontal red line *row* from azure fill, it looks like a rectangular area of intersection between vertical and horizontal lines should get excluded. The strategy will be to:

1.  **Verify Observations**: Use code execution to precisely quantify discrepancies in each example. Confirm which pixels are incorrectly filled.
2.  **Refine the Interaction Rule**: Re-evaluate how the vertical and horizontal lines interact to define the azure filling region.
3.  **Update the Natural Language Program**: Clearly articulate the refined rule.
4.  **Anticipate Edge Cases**: Consider cases where lines might be at the edges or missing.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I'll use `numpy` to compare the output of the `transform` function with the expected output for each example and summarize the findings. Since I do not have direct code execution, I'll describe the expected analysis that would be performed, and expected observations.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Expected Result: `transform(input_grid)` should exactly match `output_grid`.
    *   Analysis: (Assume this was the original case upon which the first program was based, it should be correct - but need to verify)
    *   Metrics: Number of mismatched pixels: 0 (ideally).
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Expected Result: The azure fill should be blocked not just by the horizontal line's *row*, but by a rectangular region around the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines.
    *   Analysis: Compare `transform(input_grid)` with `output_grid`. Identify the exact coordinates of the incorrectly colored pixels.
    *   Metrics: Number of mismatched pixels (likely > 0).
*   **Example 3:**
    *   Expected Result: Similar to Example 2, the azure fill should respect a region defined by both lines.
    *   Analysis:  Compare `transform(input_grid)` with `output_grid`.
    *   Metrics: Number of mismatched pixels (likely > 0).
*   **Example 4:**
    *   Expected Result: No red lines. This tests the case where there are no red lines to use.
    *   Analysis:  Compare `transform(input_grid)` with `output_grid`.
    *   Metrics: Number of mismatched pixels (likely > 0).
*    **Example 5:**
     *  Expected Results: Should see a horizontal red line.
     *  Analysis: Compare `transform(input_grid)` with `output_grid`.
     * Metrics: Number of mismatched pixels (likely > 0).

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: vertical_red_line
    type: line
    color: red
    orientation: vertical
    properties:
      contiguous: true
      single: true  # There's only one in each input where it exists.

  - name: horizontal_red_line
    type: line
    color: red
    orientation: horizontal
    properties:
      contiguous: true
      single: true # There's only one in each input where it exists

  - name: background
    type: area
    initial_color: white
    transformed_color: blue

  - name: azure_region
    type: area
    color: azure
    properties:
        relative_position: adjacent to vertical_red_line
        exclusion_zone: intersection of vertical and horizontal red lines

actions:
  - name: fill_background
    target: background
    from_color: white
    to_color: blue

  - name: fill_azure
    target: azure_region
    color: azure
    conditions:
        - vertical_red_line exists
        - not within exclusion_zone

```

**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  **Locate Red Lines:** Identify the single, contiguous, vertical red line and the single, contiguous, horizontal red line in the input grid. Either or both might not exist.

2.  **Background Fill:** Change all white (0) background pixels to blue (1).

3.  **Azure Fill (Conditional):**
    *   If *both* a vertical and a horizontal red line exist:
        *   Define an exclusion zone: This is a rectangular region whose width is defined as three columns to each side of the vertical red line and all rows making up the horizontal red line.
        *   Fill the areas three columns to the left and three columns to the right of the vertical red line with azure (8), *excluding* any pixels within the exclusion zone.
    *   If *only* a vertical red line exists:
        *    Fill the areas three columns to the left and three columns to the right of the vertical red line with azure.
    *   If *only* a horizontal red line exists:
        *  Do *not* perform any azure fill.
    *   If *neither* a vertical or horizontal line exist:
        *    Do *not* perform azure fill

4. Prioritize contiguous red lines.

This revised natural language program incorporates the crucial interaction between the vertical and horizontal red lines, defining a precise exclusion zone for the azure fill, and it addresses what should happen if no lines are found.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
