Okay, let's analyze this input-output example.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), azure (8) and blue (1). The input grid seems to have a "cross" shape formed by red pixels on a white background. The output grid maintains the red cross but changes some of the surrounding white pixels. Specifically, white pixels to the right of the vertical red line change to azure, and the rest of the white pixels change to blue.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_cross
    type: shape
    color: red (2)
    description: A cross shape formed by contiguous red pixels.
  - id: background
    type: area
    color:
      - initial: white (0)
      - final_top_right: azure (8)
      - final_other: blue (1)
    description:  The area surrounding the red cross, initially white, changes to azure and blue based on position relative to the cross.

actions:
  - name: color_change
    target: background
    parameters:
      color_map:
        right_of_vertical_red: azure (8)
        other: blue (1)
    description: Changing the color of the background based on its relative position to the red cross.

relationships:
   - type: spatial
     description: The background is divided based on its position relative to the vertical arm of the red_cross. Right of the vertical is colored azure, and the remaining white pixels are blue.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "red cross":** Locate the contiguous red (2) pixels forming a cross shape.
2.  **Divide the background:** Divide remaining area, all initially white (0), into different sections, based on a vertical boundary defined by the vertical arm of the red cross.
3. **Change Colors.**
      *   Pixels to the right of the red cross's vertical arm change to azure (8).
    *   All other pixels previously white (0) change to blue (1)

In summary, the transformation maintains the red cross and recolors the background based on its position relative to the red cross's vertical arm.
