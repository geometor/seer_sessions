Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Locate Red Lines:** Identify the single vertical and single horizontal red lines in the input grid. Note that one or the other might not exist. The lines will consist of contiguous cells of color red (2).
2.  **Background Fill:** Change all white (0) background pixels to blue (1).
3.  **Azure Fill (Conditional):**
    *   If a vertical red line exists:
        *   Fill the three columns immediately to the left of the vertical red line with azure (8). Only fill cells that are *not* part of a horizontal red line.
        *   Fill the three columns immediately to the right of the vertical red line with azure (8). Only fill cells that are *not* part of a horizontal red line.
    *   If there is no horizontal red line, proceed with the azure fill on both sides of the vertical line.
4. If any ambiguities occur (multiple potential vertical or horizontal lines) prioritize consistent results.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
