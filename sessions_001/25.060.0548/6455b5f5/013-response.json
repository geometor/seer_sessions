            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code aims to find a vertical red line and then color the white pixels to the right of it azure and the white pixels to the left blue. This approach works for some cases, but it's too restrictive. It fails when:\n\n1.  The red shape is not a perfect vertical line.\n2.  There are multiple disjoint red shapes.\n3.  There may be red shapes of other colors\n\nThe core issue is the assumption of a single, perfect vertical red line as the dividing element. We need a more general concept. A better approach is to locate *all* red pixels and then perform a flood fill, coloring to the right (or a general \"outside\") with azure, and to the left (or \"inside\") with blue, relative to the red pixels. We should generalize the concept to other shapes as well.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo properly analyze, I need to know the actual input and output grids. Since I can't directly visualize them, I'll describe what information I need and how I'd ideally use code execution to get it. Then i will use the information from the prompt as a substitute.\n\n*Ideally*, I would use a function like `compare_grids(input_grid, expected_output, generated_output)` that would:\n\n1.  Visually display the three grids side-by-side.\n2.  Highlight differences between `expected_output` and `generated_output`.\n3.  Return a dictionary of metrics:\n    *   `pixels_correct`: Number of pixels where `generated_output` matches `expected_output`.\n    *   `pixels_incorrect`: Number of pixels where they differ.\n    *   `red_pixels_input`: Number and location of red pixels in `input_grid`.\n    *   `output_colors`: Count of each color in `generated_output` and `expected_output`.\n\nSince that isn't directly available, I will proceed based on the information provided.\n\n**Example Summary** (Based on prompt description, replacing ideal code execution)\n\nThe provided results show the following for the training examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Likely works as expected, as the code was designed for this case.\n*   **Example 2:** Likely fails because the description suggests the red shape is not a vertical line.\n*   **Example 3:** Likely fails, possibly a non-vertical red section, or perhaps there are other colored components.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask_description: >\n  The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels.  The primary colors\n  involved are red, white, azure, and blue. The transformation rule depends on\n  the spatial relationship between red pixels and white pixels.\n\nobservations:\n  - object: red_shape\n    properties:\n      color: red (2)\n      shape: varies (not always a vertical line)\n    behavior: acts as a dividing element or boundary\n\n  - object: white_pixels\n    properties:\n      color: white (0)\n    behavior:\n      - transformed:\n          condition: to the right of any red_shape\n          action: change color to azure (8)\n      - transformed:\n          condition: to the left of any red_shape\n          action: change color to blue (1)\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the color red (value 2). These pixels constitute the \"red shape,\" regardless of their specific arrangement.\n\n2.  **Classify White Pixels:** For each white pixel (value 0) in the input grid:\n\n    *   **Right Side:** If the white pixel is to the *right* of *any* red pixel, change its color to azure (value 8). The term right is relative.\n    *   **Left Side:** If the white pixel is to the *left* of *any* red pixel, change its color to blue (value 1).\n\n3.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying these transformations to all white pixels in the input grid. All non-white pixels from input should remain unchanged.\n\nThe key improvement is removing the \"vertical line\" constraint and focusing on the relative position (\"left\" or \"right\") of white pixels *with respect to all red pixels*. This revised natural language program should be more general and robust. The notion of 'right' and 'left' is relative to each red pixel.\n"
