Previous Code:

"""
1.  **Identify Red Shapes:** Locate the red (2) pixels forming a vertical line and a horizontal line in the input grid. Note the intersection.
2.  **Fill with Azure:** Change to azure (8) three columns of pixels immediately to the left and the right, of the vertical red line where cells are not part of the horizontal red lines.
3. **Fill with blue**: Change to blue (1) the background.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
