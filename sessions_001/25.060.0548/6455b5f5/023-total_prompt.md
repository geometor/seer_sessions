"""
1.  **Identify the Red Shape:** Find all red (2) pixels in the input grid and consider them as a single, connected shape.
2.  **Locate Enclosed Regions:** Within the red shape, identify two distinct regions that are completely surrounded by the red pixels. One is a small section located at the top-right. The other is the larger region located at the center.
3. **Identify Background** The rest of the white pixels that are not enclosed by the red shape.
4.  **Fill Top-Right Region:** Change the color of all pixels within the small, enclosed, top-right region to azure (8).
5.  **Fill Center Region:** Change the color of all pixels within the large, enclosed, central region to blue (1).
6. **Background remains unchanged** All other pixels retain original colors.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
