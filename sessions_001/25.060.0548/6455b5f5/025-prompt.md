1.  **Identify the Red Shape:** Locate all red (2) pixels in the input grid.  These pixels form a single connected shape.
2.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:** Within the red shape, find all regions of white (0) pixels that are completely surrounded by the red pixels.
3. **Identify Background** The rest of the white pixels that are not enclosed by the red shape.
4.  **Fill the Smallest Enclosed Region:**  Change the color of all pixels within the *smallest* enclosed region to azure (8).
5.  **Fill the Remaining Enclosed Regions:** Change the color of all pixels within the *remaining* enclosed region(s) to blue (1).
6. **Background remains unchanged** All other pixels retain original colors.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
