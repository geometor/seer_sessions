Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Red Shape:** Locate all connected regions of red (2) pixels.

2.  **Highlight:** If a red shape exists, find the right-most pixel of the red shape, regardless of its vertical position. Add an azure (8) pixel immediately to the right of this pixel. If adding the pixel would exceed the grid's boundaries, do not add it.

3.  **Fill:** Starting from the bottom row of the grid, and for every column in each row, change the pixel to blue (1).
4.  **Fill Stop:** Continue filling blue upwards until the row *below* the lowest y-coordinate (highest row number) occupied by any red pixel. If no red pixel exists, do not fill.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
