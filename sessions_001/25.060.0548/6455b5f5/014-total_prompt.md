Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code aims to find a vertical red line and then color the white pixels to the right of it azure and the white pixels to the left blue. This approach works for some cases, but it's too restrictive. It fails when:

1.  The red shape is not a perfect vertical line.
2.  There are multiple disjoint red shapes.
3.  There may be red shapes of other colors

The core issue is the assumption of a single, perfect vertical red line as the dividing element. We need a more general concept. A better approach is to locate *all* red pixels and then perform a flood fill, coloring to the right (or a general "outside") with azure, and to the left (or "inside") with blue, relative to the red pixels. We should generalize the concept to other shapes as well.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To properly analyze, I need to know the actual input and output grids. Since I can't directly visualize them, I'll describe what information I need and how I'd ideally use code execution to get it. Then i will use the information from the prompt as a substitute.

*Ideally*, I would use a function like `compare_grids(input_grid, expected_output, generated_output)` that would:

1.  Visually display the three grids side-by-side.
2.  Highlight differences between `expected_output` and `generated_output`.
3.  Return a dictionary of metrics:
    *   `pixels_correct`: Number of pixels where `generated_output` matches `expected_output`.
    *   `pixels_incorrect`: Number of pixels where they differ.
    *   `red_pixels_input`: Number and location of red pixels in `input_grid`.
    *   `output_colors`: Count of each color in `generated_output` and `expected_output`.

Since that isn't directly available, I will proceed based on the information provided.

**Example Summary** (Based on prompt description, replacing ideal code execution)

The provided results show the following for the training examples:

*   **Example 1:** Likely works as expected, as the code was designed for this case.
*   **Example 2:** Likely fails because the description suggests the red shape is not a vertical line.
*   **Example 3:** Likely fails, possibly a non-vertical red section, or perhaps there are other colored components.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
task_description: >
  The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels.  The primary colors
  involved are red, white, azure, and blue. The transformation rule depends on
  the spatial relationship between red pixels and white pixels.

observations:
  - object: red_shape
    properties:
      color: red (2)
      shape: varies (not always a vertical line)
    behavior: acts as a dividing element or boundary

  - object: white_pixels
    properties:
      color: white (0)
    behavior:
      - transformed:
          condition: to the right of any red_shape
          action: change color to azure (8)
      - transformed:
          condition: to the left of any red_shape
          action: change color to blue (1)

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Red Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have the color red (value 2). These pixels constitute the "red shape," regardless of their specific arrangement.

2.  **Classify White Pixels:** For each white pixel (value 0) in the input grid:

    *   **Right Side:** If the white pixel is to the *right* of *any* red pixel, change its color to azure (value 8). The term right is relative.
    *   **Left Side:** If the white pixel is to the *left* of *any* red pixel, change its color to blue (value 1).

3.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying these transformations to all white pixels in the input grid. All non-white pixels from input should remain unchanged.

The key improvement is removing the "vertical line" constraint and focusing on the relative position ("left" or "right") of white pixels *with respect to all red pixels*. This revised natural language program should be more general and robust. The notion of 'right' and 'left' is relative to each red pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
