2.  **Locate Enclosed Regions:** Within the red shape, identify two distinct regions that are completely surrounded by the red pixels. One is a small section located at the top-right. The other is the larger region located at the center.
3. **Identify Background** The rest of the white pixels that are not enclosed by the red shape.
4.  **Fill Top-Right Region:** Change the color of all pixels within the small, enclosed, top-right region to azure (8).
5.  **Fill Center Region:** Change the color of all pixels within the large, enclosed, central region to blue (1).
6. **Background remains unchanged** All other pixels retain original colors.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example. While it performed correctly on that example, the subsequent tests reveal its limitations. The core issue is the assumption about identifying and filling "enclosed regions". The code uses a combination of connected component analysis (for the red shape) and a custom `find_enclosed_regions` function (for white enclosed areas). The logic for deciding which enclosed region gets filled with azure (8) and which with blue (1) based on the top right needs to change to something more robust. The strategy will involve these steps:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting the characteristics of the red shape, enclosed regions, and how the filling is done. Pay close attention to the *relative positions* and *sizes* of the enclosed regions.
2.  **Refine Region Identification:** The connected component analysis for identifying the red pixels is sound. We will keep that logic. The `find_enclosed_regions` also is accurate at detecting white regions.
3.  **Improve Filling Logic:** The key improvement is in the logic that determines *which* enclosed region gets filled with *which* color. The current "top-right" assumption is too simplistic.
4. **Update Program** Create a new natural language program.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand the patterns, I'll use a small helper function to give quick information.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid):
    """Provides basic information about a grid."""
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    color_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))

    width = grid.shape[1]
    print(f"  Dimensions: {height}x{width}")
    print(f"  Color Counts: {color_counts}")
    red_regions = find_connected_components(grid, 2)
    white_regions = find_connected_components(grid,0)
    enclosed = find_enclosed_regions(grid, 2)
    print(f"  Red regions: {len(red_regions)}")
    print(f"  Number of white regions: {len(white_regions)}")
    print(f"   Number of enclosed regions {len(enclosed)}")
    if enclosed:
      sizes = [len(region) for region in enclosed]
      print(f"  Enclosed region sizes: {sizes}")

    """Compares two grids and prints differences."""
    if grid1.shape != grid2.shape:
        print("  Grids have different shapes!")
        return
    diff = grid1 != grid2
    if np.any(diff):
        print("  Grids differ:")
        diff_indices = np.where(diff)
        for row, col in zip(*diff_indices):
            print(f"    Pixel at ({row}, {col}): Grid1={grid1[row, col]}, Grid2={grid2[row, col]}")
    else:
        print("  Grids are identical.")
        
# Example Usage (assuming 'train' is your list of training examples)
for i, example in enumerate(train):
  print(f"Example Input {i+1}")
  analyze_grid(example['input'])

  print(f"Example Output {i+1}")
  analyze_grid(example['output'])
    
  predicted_output = transform(example['input'])
  print(f"Prediction {i+1}:")
  compare_grids(example['output'], predicted_output)
  print("---")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Red Shape:** Locate all red (2) pixels in the input grid.  These pixels form a single connected shape.
2.  **Identify Enclosed Regions:** Within the red shape, find all regions of white (0) pixels that are completely surrounded by the red pixels.
3. **Identify Background** The rest of the white pixels that are not enclosed by the red shape.
4.  **Fill the Smallest Enclosed Region:**  Change the color of all pixels within the *smallest* enclosed region to azure (8).
5.  **Fill the Remaining Enclosed Regions:** Change the color of all pixels within the *remaining* enclosed region(s) to blue (1).
6. **Background remains unchanged** All other pixels retain original colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
