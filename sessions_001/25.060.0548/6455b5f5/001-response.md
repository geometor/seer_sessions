Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pairs, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The core element is a grid of pixels, each with a numerical value representing a color. The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), red (2), blue (1), and azure (8). There are distinct shapes formed by connected pixels of the same color. The transformation modifies the colors within the grid, but the overall shape structure seems to be mostly preserved. The key seems to lie in the color changes, and these changes are not random.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - width: variable
      - height: variable
      - cells: pixels with color values

  - name: red_shape
    type: connected_component
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - shape: irregular, resembling a cross or branching structure

  - name: white_background
    type: connected_component
    properties:
      - color: white (0)
      - shape: fills the remaining space

  - name: blue_region
    type: connected_component
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: rectangular, often filling the lower portion or a bounded area.

  - name: azure_region
    type: connected_component/pixel
    properties:
      - color: azure (8)
      - shape: small, often single pixels or short lines, sometimes connected to red.

actions:
  - name: color_change_red
    input: red_shape
    output: azure_region, potentially, or kept as red.
    conditions: adjacent to blue.

  - name: color_change_white
    input: white_background
    output: blue_region.
    conditions:  Below the red structure and bounded.

relationships:
   - red_shape *adjacent_to* white_background
   - red_shape sometimes *adjacent_to* azure_region
   - blue_region *below* red_shape (mostly)

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Shape:** Locate all pixels with the value 2 (red). These pixels form a connected, cross-like, or branching structure.

2.  **Identify the White Region to be Transformed** Find a region of white pixels (0) which is located "under", or within a closed boundary of, the red structure.

3. **Fill with Blue:** Change the color of the identified white region to blue (1)

4.  **Conditional Red to Azure:** Any red pixel (2) which is one pixel away (8-connectivity or diagonal) of the blue region in the horizontal or diagonal direction is turned to azure (8).

The program transforms parts of the grid with precise rules that apply in specific regions,
