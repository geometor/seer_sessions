The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), azure (8) and blue (1). The input grid seems to have a \"cross\" shape formed by red pixels on a white background. The output grid maintains the red cross but changes some of the surrounding white pixels. Specifically, white pixels to the right of the vertical red line change to azure, and the rest of the white pixels change to blue.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
