1. Identify all distinct gray regions in the input grid. A gray region is a group of one or more orthogonally connected gray pixels.
2. Determine if ANY of the distinct gray regions are connected to each other.  Two regions are considered connected if any pixel in one region shares an orthogonal border (up, down, left, or right) with any pixel in another region.
3. If ANY gray regions are connected, flood fill ALL gray regions with red.
4. If NO gray regions are connected, the gray regions are unchanged.
