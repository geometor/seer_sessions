Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions (12x12).
*   The primary colors involved are gray (5) and white (0).
*   The output introduces red (2) pixels.
*   The red pixels appear within regions of gray pixels, replacing some of the gray.
*   The red pixels form shapes inside.
* The shape can vary in size, sometimes its one pixel other time a rectangle.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 12x12
      colors: [0, 5, 2]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white (0)
        - gray (5)
        - red (2)
      position: (row, column)
  - type: shape
    properties:
        base_color: gray
        fill_color: red
        location: inside base shape

actions:
  - name: replace
    description: Replace some gray pixels with red pixels within gray areas.

relationships:
  - type: containment
    description: Red pixels are contained within gray pixel regions.
  - type: adjacency
    description: Gray pixels are adjacent to other gray pixels, and sometimes to white.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Inner Shape:** in each gray region. If there is a closed gray shape, change the color of the inner pixels to red.
