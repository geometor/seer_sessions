Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, assuming that the transformation involves changing "interior" gray pixels to red while leaving the "border" gray pixels unchanged. This assumption holds true for the first example, but fails for the second example. The second example reveals a different pattern, where connected gray regions sharing a border are filled with red, independent of whether the pixels can be considered 'interior'. The third example is consistent with the second. This means we need to revise our understanding of "interior" and focus on connected regions.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the input, expected output, and actual output for each example. Pay close attention to the discrepancies.
2.  **Refine Definition of Interior:** The current definition of "interior" based on immediate neighbors is incorrect. We need a concept of connected regions of gray.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Re-write the program to reflect the connected regions concept. It should describe how connected gray regions are identified and filled with red.
4. **Prepare data for the coding phase:** Provide an updated and easy to understand natural language description that reflects the observations and test results.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the transformation, let's use a more structured approach to analyzing examples. Since visual inspection is crucial, I will describe observation notes.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Input:** A single gray square shape.
    *   **Expected Output:** The interior of the square is red, the border is gray.
    *   **Actual Output:** Matches the expected output.
    *   **Observation:** The initial `is_interior` function correctly identifies the interior pixels based on the 4-neighbors rule.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Input:** Two separate, connected gray regions in an 'L' shape, and a separated gray square.
    *   **Expected Output:** Both connected regions are filled with red.
    *   **Actual Output:** Only some pixels, are red.
    *   **Observation:** The provided code fails to color all gray pixels in connected regions.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Input:** Two horizontally connected gray regions, a gray square with gray pixel.
    *   **Expected output:** Both connected regions are filled completely with red.
    *   **Actual Output:** Only some pixels, are red.
    *   **Observation:** Confirms that connected gray components sharing an edge should change to red.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of gray pixels. Two gray pixels are considered part of the same region if they share a horizontal or vertical border (not diagonal).
2.  **Connected Components:** Determine if gray regions are connected by sharing a border.
3.  **Fill with Red:** If any gray components share a border, replace *all* pixels in *all* connected gray regions with red.
4. **Isolated components:** Isolated gray components are unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
