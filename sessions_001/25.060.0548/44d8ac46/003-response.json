The input grid contains regions of gray (5) and white(0) pixels. The output grid seems to be identical to the input grid, except for a specific modification: some gray (5) pixels within a specific shape have changed to red (2). The modification isn't changing all gray to red, only those that appear within a bounded area.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Change the interior gray(5) pixels to red (2).\n4.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels (white and the exterior gray ones) remain unchanged.\n5. **Output:** The output grid is the modified copy of the input.\n\nIn short, the transformation identifies the \"interior\" gray pixels of shapes within the grid, and then colors those interior pixels to red. The outer \"border\" of the shapes remain gray.\n"
