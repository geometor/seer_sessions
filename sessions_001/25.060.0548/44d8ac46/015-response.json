The primary colors observed are white (0) and gray (5).  The output introduces a new color, red (2), in a specific location within the gray (5) regions. The overall grid structure and dimensions remain identical between input and output. The change seems localized and specific, suggesting a targeted modification rather than a global transformation.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"

The overall structure is unchanged, only the color of the specified central 2x2 pixels of the identified region have changed.\n\nIn simpler term, Find the shape that looks like letter \"H\", locate the inner 2x2 block of the \"H\" and recolor it to red.\n"
