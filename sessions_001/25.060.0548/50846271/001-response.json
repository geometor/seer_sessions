Here's a breakdown of my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Grid:** The input and output are both grids of pixels, each pixel having a color represented by an integer (0-9).\n*   **Colors:**  The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), red (2), and a new color azure (8) appears in the outputs. White(0) is also present.\n*   **Shapes:** Red (2) pixels often form cross-like shapes.\n*   **Transformation:**  It appears that some of the red (2) pixels in the cross shapes are changing to azure (8). The core logic appears to be centered on editing these red shapes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Replace with azure (8) the red(2) pixels that are *not* at the extremities of the cross.\n3.  **Output:** Create the output grid, which will contain:\n    *   All non-red pixels from the input grid without changing the value.\n    *   The edited pixels of the initial red crosses\n\nEssentially, we preserve the non-red pixels and selectively edit the existing red crosses. The key is to find the \"inner\" pixels to transform the color from red to azure.\n"
