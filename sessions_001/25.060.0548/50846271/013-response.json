Within this pattern, there are isolated clusters of red (2) pixels. The key change appears to be the introduction or modification of azure (8) pixels adjacent to some of the red clusters. The overall checkerboard structure is maintained.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

I say 'some' because some of the gray pixels remain unchanged. It appears that the modification is done only if gray(5) is a part of the underlying checkerboard pattern. In other words, if gray(5) is surrounded by white(0), it may become an azure(8)\n\nThis program describes how to identify the red clusters, check adjacent pixels, and then change a subset to azure(8) to perform the input to output transformation.\n"
