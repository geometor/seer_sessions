Okay, let's analyze this ARC task. Here's a breakdown of my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both grids of pixels, each pixel having a color represented by an integer (0-9).
*   **Colors:**  The primary colors involved seem to be gray (5), red (2), and a new color azure (8) appears in the outputs. White(0) is also present.
*   **Shapes:** Red (2) pixels often form cross-like shapes.
*   **Transformation:**  It appears that some of the red (2) pixels in the cross shapes are changing to azure (8). The core logic appears to be centered on editing these red shapes.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - pixels: integers (0-9)
      - colors: [gray, red, azure, white]
  - name: cross
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - structure:  contiguous pixels, often forming a "+" shape or variations of it.
actions:
  - name: color_change
    type: transformation
    properties:
      - input_color: red (2)
      - output_color: azure (8)
      - target: Specific red pixels within the cross.
relationships:
    - cross: "part_of grid"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Cross Shapes:** Locate all red (2) "cross" shapes within the input grid. A cross shape can be a single red pixel or a contiguous + shaped set of red pixels.
2.  **Inner Pixel Check.** Examine the red pixels. Replace with azure (8) the red(2) pixels that are *not* at the extremities of the cross.
3.  **Output:** Create the output grid, which will contain:
    *   All non-red pixels from the input grid without changing the value.
    *   The edited pixels of the initial red crosses

Essentially, we preserve the non-red pixels and selectively edit the existing red crosses. The key is to find the "inner" pixels to transform the color from red to azure.
