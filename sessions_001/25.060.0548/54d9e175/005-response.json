            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the importance of the gray columns and the adjacency-based color transformations. However, the code fails on the second and third examples.\nThe problems:\n\n1.  Example two has no gray, so every pixel is transformed incorrectly.\n2.  Example three does not have gray columns either.\n3. The color substitution rules apply only on specific colors and not others.\n\nI need a strategy for detecting when special processing is required. I should look for consistent processing and special case processing.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** I need to carefully re-examine all examples, paying close attention to *all* colors and spatial relationships, not just the ones identified in the first example. The concept of \"anchor\" columns might be too specific. It's more likely a general rule based on *relative* positions and colors.\n2.  **Generalized Color Mapping:** Instead of hardcoding color transformations (e.g., blue to orange), I will look for a more general pattern of color changes. It is possible there's a consistent mapping or rule that applies to all colors, not just specific ones.\n3. **Column shift:** There may be some column shift.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary):**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_grid(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    unique_colors = np.unique(grid)\n    print(f\"  Dimensions: {rows}x{cols}\")\n    print(f\"  Unique Colors: {unique_colors}\")\n    for color in unique_colors:\n        count = np.sum(grid == color)\n        print(f\"    Color {color}: Count = {count}\")\n\ntask_data = {\n    \"train\": [\n        {\n            \"input\": [\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n            ],\n            \"output\": [\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n            ],\n            \"output\": [\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"input\": [\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n                [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n            ],\n            \"output\": [\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n                [7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(task_data[\"train\"]):\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}: Input\")\n    describe_grid(np.array(example[\"input\"]))\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}: Output\")\n    describe_grid(np.array(example[\"output\"]))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n```\n\n**Example 1: Input**\n\n    Dimensions: 9x9\n    Unique Colors: [0 5]\n    Color 0: Count = 72\n    Color 5: Count = 9\n\n**Example 1: Output**\n\n    Dimensions: 9x9\n    Unique Colors: [5 6]\n    Color 5: Count = 9\n    Color 6: Count = 72\n\n**Example 2: Input**\n\n    Dimensions: 9x9\n    Unique Colors: [0 1]\n    Color 0: Count = 72\n    Color 1: Count = 9\n\n**Example 2: Output**\n\n    Dimensions: 9x9\n    Unique Colors: [6 7]\n    Color 6: Count = 72\n    Color 7: Count = 9\n\n**Example 3: Input**\n\n    Dimensions: 9x9\n    Unique Colors: [0 2]\n    Color 0: Count = 72\n    Color 2: Count = 9\n\n**Example 3: Output**\n\n    Dimensions: 9x9\n    Unique Colors: [6 7]\n    Color 6: Count = 72\n    Color 7: Count = 9\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      All examples are 9x9 grids.\n  - observation: |\n      The first column of the input grid is always a solid color other than white (0).\n  - observation: |\n      The input grid's first column always contains a single color.
