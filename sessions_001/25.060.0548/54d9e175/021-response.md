Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains single pixels of various colors (blue, red, green, yellow) scattered within a larger region of gray pixels. There's also a horizontal line of gray pixels dividing the grid roughly in the middle. The output grid appears to create 3x3 blocks of new colors (magenta, azure, orange, maroon) centered on the locations of the original single, non-gray, pixels in the input grid. The gray line seems to be preserved.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, red, green, yellow, gray]
      - height: 7
      - width: 11
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [magenta, azure, orange, maroon, gray]
      - height: 7
      - width: 11
  - object: colored_pixels
    type: individual_pixels
    properties:
      - input_colors: [blue, red, green, yellow]
      - locations: [(1,5), (1, 9), (5, 5), (5,9), (5,1)]
      - output_block_color_mapping: {
           blue: azure,
           red: maroon,
           green: orange,
           yellow: magenta,
      }
  - object: gray_line
    type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - color: gray
      - row_index: 3
      - preserved: true
  - object: output_blocks
      type: blocks
      properties:
        - size: 3x3
        - shape: square
        - centers: "locations of colored_pixels"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all non-gray pixels (blue, red, green, yellow) in the *input grid*, excluding those in the gray dividing line, and also excluding all white colored pixels.
2.  **Gray Line Preservation:** Copy the horizontal gray line (row index 3) from the input grid to the output grid directly.
3.  **Generate Blocks:** For each identified key pixel:
    *   Determine the corresponding output color: blue becomes azure, red becomes maroon, green becomes orange, and yellow becomes magenta.
    *   Create a 3x3 square block of the corresponding output color in the *output grid*.
    *   Center the 3x3 block on the location of the original key pixel in the input grid.
4. **Background**: All remaining pixels should have the same color as those of the dividing gray line.
