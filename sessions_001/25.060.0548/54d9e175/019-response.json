            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of separating the grid based on grey (5) pixels and applying different colors to the regions. However, the results reveal a crucial flaw in the handling of multiple separators within the *same column*. The original logic assumed separators would neatly divide the grid into distinct *columns*, but the examples show that multiple separators can exist *vertically* within a column, creating sub-regions *within* columns. This means we need to adjust our approach to consider separators on a per-row basis rather than a purely column-wise division.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Row-wise Processing:** Instead of finding *all* separator indices at once, we'll iterate through each row of the grid individually.\n2.  **Per-Row Separators:** For each row, we'll identify the first and last separator indices.\n3.  **Region Coloring:** Within each row, we'll apply the color transformations based on these per-row separator positions.\n4.  **Handle Edge Cases:** Correctly manage rows with zero or one separator.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using code execution for verification):**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef code_execution(grids):\n    \"\"\"\n    Executes the existing transform function on each grid in the input list.\n    Returns a report comparing generated output to actual\n    \"\"\"\n    results = {}\n    report = \"\"\n    \n    def get_separator_indices(grid, separator_color=5):\n        \"\"\"Finds the column indices of separator pixels.\"\"\"\n        return np.where(grid == separator_color)[1]\n\n    def transform(input_grid):\n        \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the observed rules.\"\"\"\n        output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n        rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n        # 1.

These are the row's separators.\n3.  **Handle No Separators:** If a row has no separators, replace all non-grey pixels in that row with azure (8).\n4.  **Handle One Separator:** If a row has exactly one separator, replace all non-grey pixels to the left of the separator with azure (8) and all non-grey pixels to the right with maroon (9).\n5.  **Handle Multiple Separators:** If a row has two or more separators:\n    *   Replace all non-grey pixels to the left of the *first* separator in that row with azure (8).\n    *   Replace all non-grey pixels between the *first* and *last* separator in that row with magenta (6).\n    *   Replace all non-grey pixels to the right of the *last* separator in that row with maroon (9).\n6.  **Preserve Separators:** Ensure that all grey (5) pixels remain unchanged in the output grid, regardless of their position.\n\nThis revised program explicitly addresses the row-wise nature of the transformation and correctly handles cases with varying numbers of separators within each row. It's more precise and covers all observed scenarios in the training examples.\n"
