Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Key Columns:** Locate the columns in the input grid that contain only gray (5) and white (0) pixels. These are considered "anchor" columns.
2. **Preserve Anchor Columns:** Copy the gray (5) pixels from the anchor columns in the input grid directly to the corresponding positions in the output grid.
3. **Color Substitution of colored pixels:** All the colored pixels (blue and red) are transformed to orange(7)
4. **Color Substitution of white pixels near gray columns:** White pixels, horizontally adjacent to gray columns (left or right), become orange (7)
5. **Color Substitution of remaining white pixels:** All other white pixels (0) in the input, which aren't horizontally adjacent to gray(5), are transformed to magenta (6) in the output grid.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, correctly identifying the importance of the gray columns and the adjacency-based color transformations. However, the code fails on the second and third examples.
The problems:

1.  Example two has no gray, so every pixel is transformed incorrectly.
2.  Example three does not have gray columns either.
3. The color substitution rules apply only on specific colors and not others.

I need a strategy for detecting when special processing is required. I should look for consistent processing and special case processing.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Re-examine Assumptions:** I need to carefully re-examine all examples, paying close attention to *all* colors and spatial relationships, not just the ones identified in the first example. The concept of "anchor" columns might be too specific. It's more likely a general rule based on *relative* positions and colors.
2.  **Generalized Color Mapping:** Instead of hardcoding color transformations (e.g., blue to orange), I will look for a more general pattern of color changes. It is possible there's a consistent mapping or rule that applies to all colors, not just specific ones.
3. **Column shift:** There may be some column shift.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      All examples are 9x9 grids.
  - observation: |
      The first column of the input grid is always a solid color other than white (0).
  - observation: |
      The input grid's first column always contains a single color. This color is transformed to '7' (orange) in the output grid.
  - observation: |
    The input grid can contain white (0)
  - observation: |
      All white (0) pixels in the input grid are transformed to magenta(6) in the output.
  - observation: |
      In Example 1, the gray (5) pixels in the center column are preserved in the output.  The white pixels (0) become magenta(6).

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **First Column Transformation:** The color of the first column in the input grid is transformed to orange (7) in the output grid.
2.  **White Pixel Transformation:** All white (0) pixels in the input grid are transformed to magenta (6) in the output grid.
3. **Preserve Gray Column:** If there exists a column where all values are gray(5), then preserve it.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
