  - relationships:
    - observation: "Non-zero values in the input (except 5) are replaced by other colours."
    - observation: "The gray color (5) is unchanged in location and value"
    - observation: the numbers 2, 3 and 1 are replaced by three contiguous blocks of the same size of colors 7, 8, and 6, starting from left to right, top to bottom.
