The input grid contains distinct colored regions, while the output grid appears to be a modified version where some original colors are replaced, and potentially new regions formed. The key seems to lie in understanding how the non-zero values in the input relate to the colored regions in the output. The number 5 seems to be some kind of static element, and does not change between input and output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
