Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Regions:** Divide the input grid into three distinct regions based on the non-zero colored pixels. The first region, on the left, is defined by color values other than grey. The second (middle) region is defined by a block of grey. The third (rightmost) region is also defined by non-zero color values.
2.  **Color Mapping:**
    *   Replace all pixels in the area left of the first solid 5 with 8.
    *   Replace pixels of color 3 (green) within the left region with 8 (azure).
    *   Leave 5 (grey) unchanged.
    *   Replace all pixels between the first and second solid 5 with 6.
    *  Replace pixels of color 1 (blue) between solid 5 blocks with 6 (magenta).
    *   Replace all pixels in the area right of the second solid 5 with 9.
    * Replace pixels of color 4 (yellow) within the right region with 9 (maroon).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
