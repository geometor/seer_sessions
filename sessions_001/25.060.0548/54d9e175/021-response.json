The input grid contains single pixels of various colors (blue, red, green, yellow) scattered within a larger region of gray pixels. There's also a horizontal line of gray pixels dividing the grid roughly in the middle. The output grid appears to create 3x3 blocks of new colors (magenta, azure, orange, maroon) centered on the locations of the original single, non-gray, pixels in the input grid. The gray line seems to be preserved.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
