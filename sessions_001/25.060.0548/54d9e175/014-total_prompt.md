Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example, aiming to replace non-zero and non-five values with specific colors in 3x3 blocks. While this worked for the first example, it failed to generalize to the other training examples. The core issue is that the replacement logic is too rigid and doesn't account for the variations in how colors are assigned and how regions are expanded. The strategy for resolving this is to:

1.  **Analyze each example individually**: Identify the specific transformation rules for each case, paying close attention to how different colors and shapes are handled.
2.  **Identify common principles**: Look for patterns and rules that apply across multiple examples, even if the specific colors or shapes vary.
3.  **Refine the natural language program**: Describe the transformation in a more general way, capturing the underlying logic rather than hardcoding specific color mappings or expansion rules.
4.  **Iteratively improve**: use an iterative process.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To understand what is happening in the example we will perform these steps
and collect these metrics for analysis:

1.  **Input and Output Grids**: Display the input and output grids.
2.  **Unique Colors**: List the unique colors in the input and output grids.
3.  **Color Mapping**: Determine the mapping between input and output colors.
4.  **Shape Changes**: Describe any changes in the shapes or positions of colored regions.
5. output of transform function
6. compare output with expected

Let's apply this to each training example:

**Example 1**

```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])

expected_output = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0],
    [0, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
])
output_grid = transform(input_grid)

print("Unique colors in input:", np.unique(input_grid))
print("Unique colors in output:", np.unique(expected_output))
print("transform result equals expected", np.array_equal(expected_output, output_grid))


```

```
Unique colors in input: [0 1 2 5]
Unique colors in output: [0 5 7 8]
transform result equals expected True
```

-   **Color Mapping**: 1 -> 7, 2 -> 8, 0 and 5 remain unchanged.
-   **Shape Changes**: The single pixels of colors 1 and 2 are expanded into 3x3 blocks of colors 7 and 8, respectively.

print("Unique colors in input:", np.unique(input_grid))
print("Unique colors in output:", np.unique(expected_output))
print("transform result equals expected", np.array_equal(expected_output, output_grid))

```

```
Unique colors in input: [0 1 3 5]
Unique colors in output: [0 5 6 7]

```

-   **Color Mapping**: 1 -> 7, 3 -> 6, 0 and 5 remain unchanged.
-   **Shape Changes**: Only the *single* pixels of colors 1 and 3 are changed to colors 7 and 6, respectively. The 3x3 expansion does *not* occur.

```

```
Unique colors in input: [0 1 2 5]

```

-   **Color Mapping**: 1 -> 7, 2 -> 8, 0 and 5 remain unchanged.
-   **Shape Changes**: Similar to Example 2, only the single pixels of colors 1 and 2 are changed to colors 7 and 8, respectively, without 3x3 expansion.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Dynamic Pixels:** Find all pixels in the input grid that have colors other than 0 and 5. These are the "dynamic pixels."
2.  **Color Mapping:** Create a mapping between the colors of the dynamic pixels and new colors. The mapping is determined by the order in which the dynamic pixel colors appear in the input grid, reading from top to bottom and left to right.
    *   The first dynamic color maps to 7 (orange).
    *   The second dynamic color maps to 8 (azure).
    *   The third dynamic color maps to 6 (magenta).
3.  **Conditional Replacement/Expansion**:
    *   If a dynamic pixel is part of a contiguous region of the *same* color that is larger than 1x1 (i.e., it has at least one directly adjacent neighbor of the same color), *do not change* the pixel's color, and do not expand.
    *   If a dynamic pixel is a *single* pixel (no adjacent neighbors of the same color), replace it with its mapped color, *without* expansion.
4.  **Preserve Static Colors:** Pixels with colors 0 and 5 remain unchanged.

The key difference from the initial program is the *conditional* expansion and replacement. The expansion to 3x3 *only* happened in the first training case. In the other cases, it's a direct color replacement *without expansion*, and only for isolated pixels.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
