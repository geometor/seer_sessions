The yellow (4) appears as a solid horizontal line separating two regions of intermixed white and red pixels.\n* **Output Grids:** The output grids contain only white (0) and green (3).  The output grids seem smaller overall. The green appears to replace specific regions.\n* **Size Change:** The output grids are smaller (fewer rows and same cols) than the corresponding input grids.\n*    **Color transformation:** Red becomes green, some of the white becomes green and the yellow separating line goes away.\n\n**YAML Fact Identification:**\n\n"
