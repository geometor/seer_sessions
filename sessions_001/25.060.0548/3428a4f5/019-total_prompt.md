Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify a Repeating Pattern:** Find a vertically repeating pattern of a single color in the input grid.  This pattern consists of a contiguous block of one or more pixels of the same color, repeated vertically with no intervening pixels of a different color.
2. **Determine Pattern Height and Color:** Measure the height of a single instance of the repeating pattern. Note the color of the repeating pattern.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid. The output height will be input height - pattern height + 1, width same as input.
4. **Locate Pattern in Input:** identify the top row of the pattern in the input grid
5. **Construct Output:** create a section of output that is all white rows equal to the distance between top of grid and top of pattern
6.  **Modify Pattern Color:** If the identified color is red (2), change it to green (3) in the output. Otherwise, keep original color.
7.  **Replicate:** Copy the potentially modified pattern to output.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
