observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - object_1:  Rows of color 0.
        - object_2:  Row of color 2.
        - object_3:  Row of color 4.
      output_objects:
        - object_1: Rows of color 0
        - object_2: Row of color 3
      actions:
        - action_1: Remove row of color 4.
        - action_2: Change color of object_2 from 2 to 3.
        - action_3: Combine every two consecutive rows into one.  The top row's color takes precedence, unless the bottom row has a different, non-zero color.
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - object_1:  Rows and pixels of color 0.
        - object_2:  Single pixel of color 2.
        - object_3: Single pixel of color 4
      output_objects:
        - object_1: Rows of color 0.
        - object_2: Single pixel of color 3
      actions:
        - action_1: Change color of object_2 from 2 to 3.
        - action_2: Combine every two consecutive rows into one.  The top row's color takes precedence, unless the bottom row has a different, non-zero color.
  - example_3:
      input_objects:
        - object_1:  Rows of color 1.
        - object_2:  Rows of color 0.
        - object_3: Row of color 2.
      output_objects:
        - object_1: Row of color 1.
        - object_2: Row of color 3.
        - object_3: Row of color 0
      actions:
        - action_1: Change the color of object_3 from 2 to 3.
        - action_2: Combine every two consecutive rows into one.  The top row's color takes precedence, unless the bottom row has a different, non-zero color.
  - example_4:
    input_objects:
      - object_1: Rows of color 0
      - object_2: Two adjacent pixels of color 2
      - object_3: Two adjacent pixels of color 4
    output_objects:
      - object_1: Rows of color 0
      - object_2: Two adjacent pixels of color 3
    actions:
      - action_1: Change color of object_2 from 2 to 3
