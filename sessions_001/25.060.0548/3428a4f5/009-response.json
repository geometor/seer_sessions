The output is a 6x5 grid (smaller).\n*   The input grid contains colors white (0), red (2), and yellow (4).\n*   The output grid contains colors white (0) and green (3).\n*   The output grid seems to be a simplified or \"zoomed-in\" version of a section of the input, with color changes.\n*   The yellow row in the input is removed, and the rest is a green object filling some red connected components, leaving some of them out, particularly small objects of size 1.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
