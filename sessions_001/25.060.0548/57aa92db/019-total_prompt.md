Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the blue rectangle with one yellow pixel at its center at the top. Separately, identify disconnected azure and yellow shapes.

2.  **Preserve:** The blue shape and its inner yellow pixel remain unchanged.

3.  **Combine and Expand:** For each pair of disconnected azure and yellow shapes:
    a. Combine their bounding boxes.
    b. Expand the combined shape by one azure pixel in all directions (right, left, below).
    c. Extend the azure background upwards from the top of this expanded shape to the top row of the grid, but only within the horizontal bounds of the expanded shape.

4. The output consists of the unchanged top shape and the newly combined and expanded shapes.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
