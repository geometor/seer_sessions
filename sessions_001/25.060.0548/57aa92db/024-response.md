Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan for improvement:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was a good start, correctly identifying some key aspects of the transformation, particularly the expansion of the yellow and green objects. However, it made some incorrect assumptions and had some implementation errors:

1.  **Green Object Expansion:** The code expands the green object, but not sufficiently and not always in the correct direction. It adds a pixel to the left and diagonally up/left. The correct transformation involves extending the "line" of green pixels based on the inferred direction from the single green pixel in the input. The direction is to the 'southeast', but only when there is no azure object in the way.

2.  **Yellow Object Expansion:** The code correctly expands the yellow object downwards. It correctly identified the need to replace the red (color 2) pixels with yellow (color 4).

3.  **Azure Object Handling:** The code copies the entire input grid, so the azure object in the first and second examples is copied to the output as intended.

4. **Overlapping objects:** It is possible for multiple objects to exist and to
   expand into areas already filled by other objects, or that will be filled by
   other object.

**Strategy for Improvement**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** Use `find_object` consistently to locate *all* relevant objects (green, yellow, azure) in each input grid. This is already mostly done.

2.  **Improve Green Expansion Logic:** The green expansion needs to determine a direction and extend along that direction.

3. **Ensure Boundary Handling and Overlap Resolution**

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
objects:
  - color: green
    behavior: extend_line
    constraints:
      - blocked_by: azure
  - color: yellow
    behavior: expand_down
    constraints:
      - replaces: red
  - color: azure
    behavior: copy
  - color: red
    behavior: remove # if adjacent to yellow
    constraints: []
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Copy Azure:** Copy all azure (8) colored objects from the input to the output grid without modification.
2.  **Expand Yellow:** Locate the yellow (4) colored object. Extend this object downwards by two additional rows, replacing any red (2) pixels in those new positions with yellow (4).
3.  **Extend Green:** Locate the green (3) colored object.  If there is no azure object to the southeast of this, extend the green object along a line towards the southeast, adding green pixels to the output grid. If there *is* an azure object in the way, do not extend.

The core idea here is an order of operations, copy the azure, expand down the
yellow object, then extend the green object along the southeast direction.
