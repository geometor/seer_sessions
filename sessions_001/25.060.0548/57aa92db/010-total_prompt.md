Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits (0-9), representing colors. The primary elements are contiguous blocks of non-zero colored pixels, which can be considered "objects." The background is consistently white (0). Objects appear to be moving and sometimes changing shape. The overall layout is sparse, with a lot of white space.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: obj1
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: row 2, column 6
    shape: single pixel, then horizontal line
    movement: None, then replication
  - id: obj2
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: row 2, column 3
    shape: single pixel, grows to horizontal line.
    movement: stays
  - id: obj3
     color: magenta(6)
     initial_position: row 7, column 12
     shape: single
     movement: down, replicates
  - id: obj4
    color: green (3)
    initial_position: row 12, column 7
    shape: single, horizontal replication
    movement: stays, replicates

transformations:
  - type: object_replication
    description: Objects of a single pixel replicate, generally, it appears, to fill surrounding whitespace until contact.
  - type: shape_change
    description: Some objects replicate themselves horizontally, with whitespace between them.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels. Each block is an object.
2.  **Replicate Objects:** Find all objects with an initial shape of a single pixel.
3. **Horizontal Replication, Spaced**: Replicate the object horizontally until they touch another object, the edge of the object or the edge of the grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
