Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output example and provide my observations, a YAML block documenting facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves two grids of digits (representing colors). The input grid contains a few distinct colored regions (green, blue, and yellow). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid, where:

1.  The green and, initially, single blue pixel regions in the top left remain unchanged.
2.  The yellow region expands and there is a new set of blue pixels filling the same positions with the same shape as the original set of blue pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_region
    type: shape
    color: green
    initial_position: top_left
    action: unchanged

  - id: original_blue_region
    type: shape
    color: blue
    initial_position: adjacent_to_green
    action: remove one and duplicate remaining ones in place

  - id: yellow_region
    type: shape
    color: yellow
    initial_position: bottom_middle
    action: expand_up_and_down
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate the connected regions of green, blue, and yellow pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Preserve Green:** Keep the green region in the output grid exactly as it is in the input grid.
3.  **Remove one blue:** remove the blue pixel that is the farthest right.
4.  **Duplicate and position remaining blue pixels:** keep the remaining set of blue pixels in place, with the same shape.
5. **Expand Yellow Region:** increase the border of the yellow region by including the row adjacent to them, both up and down.
