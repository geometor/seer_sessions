There are several distinct colored objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) present in the input grid. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with some objects seemingly moved, expanded, or otherwise altered. The background is white (0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
