Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels. There are several distinct colored objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) present in the input grid. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, with some objects seemingly moved, expanded, or otherwise altered. The background is white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: green_object
    color: green (3)
    shape: single pixel, then expands to L
    initial_position: [2, 4]
    action: expands diagonally and to the left
    
  - id: red_object
    color: red (2)
    shape: single pixel, then a small vertical bar.
    initial_position: [2, 5]
    action: stays constant.

  - id: azure_object
    color: azure (8)
    shape: single pixel, 1x2 rectangle, then single pixel again
    initial_position: [3, 14], expands, then top pixel at [3,14].
    action: stays in same position.
    
  - id: yellow_object
      color: yellow (4)
      shape: 2x2 square
      initial_position: [7, 6]
      action: expands downwards, absorbing the red object below.

  - id: red_object_2
      color: red (2)
      shape: 2x2 square
      initial_position: [9, 6]
      action: absorbed by yellow object

relationships:
  - The green object expands.
  - The azure object stays constant.
  - The yellow object expands downward and merges with the red square below it.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Green Object Expansion:** The single green pixel expands. One pixel to the left, and one diagonally up and to the left.
2.  **Azure Object Stays:** The isolated azure object and isolated azure object in rectangle formation stays in the same place.
3.  **Yellow Object Expansion/Merge:** The 2x2 yellow square expands downwards by two rows. It overlaps and effectively replaces/merges with the 2x2 red square that was originally positioned directly below it.
4. Other red object also stays constant.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
