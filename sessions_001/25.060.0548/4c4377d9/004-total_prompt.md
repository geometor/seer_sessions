**input:**
```
9 9 5 9
5 5 9 9
9 5 9 9
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7B4BFE15CBD0>

**output:**
```
9 5 9 9
5 5 9 9
9 9 5 9
9 9 5 9

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids of digits. The digits represent colors, specifically 9 (maroon) and 5 (gray). The input grid is 3x4, and the output grid is 6x4. The output grid appears to be related to the input grid, with some kind of pattern replication or alteration. The relationship is spatial. The main difference are sizes. The most obvious relationship is a replication of the rows and columns.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task: replication
input_grid:
  dimensions: [3, 4]
  colors: [9, 5]
  pattern: "alternating colors in rows and columns, starting with 9"
output_grid:
  dimensions: [6, 4]
  colors: [9, 5]
  pattern: "mirrors input pattern"
relationships:
  - type: "row replication"
    description: "Each row from the input is duplicated in the output"
  - type: "column rearrangement/swapping"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Row Replication:** Take each row in the input grid and repeat it twice, placing the duplicated rows directly below the original in order to create a new grid.
2. Swap the second and third rows in the top of the grid
3. Swap the forth and fifth rows in the second half of the grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
