Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observing a pattern of row duplication and a specific row swap (rows 2 and 3). However, the results from testing on all training examples reveal that the row swapping isn't a universal rule. The core operation is row duplication, but the positioning of the duplicated row relative to the original varies. It's not always directly below, and it doesn't always involve a simple swap. Instead, it seems like the replicated row may shift the other rows.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Metrics:** Examine each example's input, expected output, and the transformed output from the current code. Focus on:
    *   Dimensions.
    *   Color counts.
    *   Differences between expected and transformed grids.
    * Find the white (value is 0) pixels

2.  **Identify Correct Transformation:** Determine the exact rule for row insertion/duplication. The key seems to be where original rows end up in the output and where the duplicate is placed.

3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately describe the observed transformation.

4.  **Code Update:**  (in the next phase).

**Metrics and Observations (using the provided results - code execution not needed since results given):**

Here's a summary of the results from the provided `print(result)` output:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Output Colors: {5: 16, 0: 2}
    *   Transformed Colors: {5: 32, 0: 4}
    *   Grids Equal (Output, Transformed): False

      ```

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Dimensions: (4, 4)
    *   Output Dimensions: (6, 4)
    *   Transformed Dimensions: (8, 4)
    *   Input Colors: {1: 14, 0: 2}

       ```

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Input Dimensions: (3, 8)
    *   Output Dimensions: (4, 8)
    *   Transformed Dimensions: (6, 8)
    *   Input Colors: {8: 22, 0: 2}

    *   Grids Equal (Output, Transformed): False
      *    Diff:
      ```
        [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [(8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (0, 0), (0, 0), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8)], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [(8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8)]]
      ```
**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      columns: variable
      colors: [0-9] # All colors are possible.
    actions:
      - duplicate_row:
          description: "A row is duplicated."
          parameters:
            original_row_index: "Index of the row to be duplicated."
            new_row_index: "Index where the duplicated row will be inserted."
  - constant: white_pixels
    properties:
     count: 2
     location: adjacent
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the row containing two adjacent white (0) pixels.** This is the target row.
2.  **Duplicate the target row.**
3.  **Insert the duplicated row into the grid.** The insertion point appears to be *before* the last row of the input grid. This effectively makes the original last row to be inserted *after* the duplicated row.
4. The input is expanded by inserting the original last row *before* the duplicated last row, and also inserting a copy of the row with the white pixels at the row location of the input grid.
