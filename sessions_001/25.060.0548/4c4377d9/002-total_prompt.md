**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements appear to be 2D grids of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The transformation seems to involve a change in the grid's dimensions and a rearrangement of the pixels, maintaining some relative positioning. It's important to note that there are repeating patterns and symmetry. The main action involves a change in size (adding rows) and reordering the existing rows, with the new rows being copies of the original rows.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - grid:
      type: 2D array
      elements: pixels (integers 0-9 representing colors)
      properties:
        - height: number of rows
        - width: number of columns
        - color_pattern: arrangement of pixel colors

actions:
  - reorder_rows:
    description:  Rows from the input grid are reordered in the output grid, and they are sometimes replicated
  - replicate_rows:
      description: add additional rows based on existing rows.

relationships:
  - input_output:
      description:  The input grid is transformed into the output grid by adding rows. The added rows are reordered and replicates of the original rows.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Observe:** Examine the input grid's rows.
2. **Replicate:** The height (number of rows) of output is double height of input.
3. **Reorder/duplicate:** The original rows are reordered to form the output rows. Reordering sequence is:
    *   The last row of the input becomes the first row of the output.
    *   The second to last row of the input becomes the second row.
    *   The first row is the third row of the input.
    *   Repeat rows in reverse order to create the final output.

In essence, the transformation takes the input, reorders the rows in reverse order, and then the output contains two copies of the reordered set of rows.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
