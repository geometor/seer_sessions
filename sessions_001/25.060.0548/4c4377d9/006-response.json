            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided information and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was based on observing a pattern of row duplication and a specific row swap (rows 2 and 3). However, the results from testing on all training examples reveal that the row swapping isn't a universal rule. The core operation is row duplication, but the positioning of the duplicated row relative to the original varies. It's not always directly below, and it doesn't always involve a simple swap. Instead, it seems like the replicated row may shift the other rows.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Detailed Metrics:** Examine each example's input, expected output, and the transformed output from the current code. Focus on:\n    *   Dimensions.\n    *   Color counts.\n    *   Differences between expected and transformed grids.\n    * Find the white (value is 0) pixels\n\n2.  **Identify Correct Transformation:** Determine the exact rule for row insertion/duplication. The key seems to be where original rows end up in the output and where the duplicate is placed.\n\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately describe the observed transformation.\n\n4.  **Code Update:**  (in the next phase).\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using the provided results - code execution not needed since results given):**\n\nHere's a summary of the results from the provided `print(result)` output:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: (3, 6)\n    *   Output Dimensions: (4, 6)\n    *   Transformed Dimensions: (6, 6)\n    *   Input Colors: {5: 16, 0: 2}\n    *   Output Colors: {5: 16, 0: 2}\n    *   Transformed Colors: {5: 32, 0: 4}\n    *   Grids Equal (Output, Transformed): False\n    *    Diff:\n      ```\n        [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [(5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5)], [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5], [(5, 5), (5, 5), (0, 0), (0, 0), (5, 5), (5, 5)], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5]]\n      ```\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: (3, 7)\n    *   Output Dimensions: (4, 7)\n    *   Transformed Dimensions: (6, 7)\n    *   Input Colors: {5: 19, 0: 2}\n    *   Output Colors: {5: 19, 0: 2}\n    *   Transformed Colors: {5: 38, 0: 4}\n    *   Grids Equal (Output, Transformed): False\n      *    Diff:\n      ```\n       [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [(5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5)], [(5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5), (5, 5)], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5]]\n      ```\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: (4, 4)\n    *   Output Dimensions: (6, 4)\n    *   Transformed Dimensions: (8, 4)\n    *   Input Colors: {1: 14, 0: 2}\n    *   Output Colors: {1: 22, 0: 2}\n    *   Transformed Colors: {1: 28, 0: 4}\n    *   Grids Equal (Output, Transformed): False\n      *    Diff:\n       ```\n        [[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)], [(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)], [1, 1, 0, 0]]\n       ```\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Input Dimensions: (3, 8)\n    *   Output Dimensions: (4, 8)\n    *   Transformed Dimensions: (6, 8)\n    *   Input Colors: {8: 22, 0: 2}\n    *   Output Colors: {8: 22, 0: 2}\n    *   Transformed Colors: {8: 44, 0: 4}\n    *   Grids Equal (Output, Transformed): False\n      *    Diff:\n      ```\n        [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [(8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (0, 0), (0, 0), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8)], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], [(8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8), (8, 8)]]\n      ```\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: grid\n    properties:\n      rows: variable\n      columns: variable\n      colors: [0-9] # All colors are possible.\n    actions:\n      - duplicate_row:\n          description: \"A row is duplicated.\"\n          parameters:\n            original_row_index: \"Index of the row to be duplicated.\"\n            new_row_index: \"Index where the duplicated row will be inserted.\"\n  - constant: white_pixels\n    properties:\n     count: 2\n     location: adjacent\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the row containing two adjacent white (0) pixels.** This is the target row.\n2.  **Duplicate the target row.**\n3.  **Insert the duplicated row into the grid.** The insertion point appears to be *before* the last row of the input grid. This effectively makes the original last row to be inserted *after* the duplicated row.\n4. The input is expanded by inserting the original last row *before* the duplicated last row, and also inserting a copy of the row with the white pixels at the row location of the input grid.\n\n"
