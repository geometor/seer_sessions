The digits represent colors, specifically 9 (maroon) and 5 (gray). The input grid is 3x4, and the output grid is 6x4. The output grid appears to be related to the input grid, with some kind of pattern replication or alteration. The relationship is spatial. The main difference are sizes. The most obvious relationship is a replication of the rows and columns.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
