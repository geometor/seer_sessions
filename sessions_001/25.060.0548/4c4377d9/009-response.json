Both grids contain single-digit integer values, which represent different colors. The primary colors observed are blue (1) and yellow (4). The grids have different dimensions; the input grid is 3x4, and the output grid is 6x4. The output appears to be a modified, enlarged version of the input, not just simply scaled up.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
