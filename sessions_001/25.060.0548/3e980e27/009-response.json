The primary colors observed are yellow (4), green (3), and background/white (0). There appear to be distinct \"objects\" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve a relocation or mirroring of these objects, specifically across both the horizontal and vertical axes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In this specific example, these consist of yellow (4) and green (3) pixels.\n\n2.  **Mirroring:** Mirror the positions of *all* identified objects *both* horizontally and vertically. This effectively means performing two reflections:\n    *   **Horizontal Reflection:** For each object, calculate its mirrored position across the vertical center line of the grid.\n    *   **Vertical Reflection:** For each object, calculate its mirrored position across the horizontal center line of the grid. Because we do both, it is a central inversion.\n\n3. **Combined Reflection:** Since each cluster is reflected along both the horizontal and vertical axis independently, this combines to the reflection through the center point of the image.\n4.  **Reconstruct Grid:** Place the mirrored objects in their new positions on a new grid, maintaining the original grid's dimensions and background color (0). If a pixel was originally part of an object, the pixel in the corresponding mirrored location in the output grid will have the same color. Otherwise, pixels in the output grid remain 0.\n\nIn simpler terms, imagine flipping the grid both left-to-right *and* top-to-bottom. The colored objects will swap positions across both the center vertical and horizontal lines of the grid.\n"
