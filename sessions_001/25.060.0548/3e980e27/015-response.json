The primary operation appears to be a combination of mirroring and potentially shifting certain colored objects. It's crucial to identify which objects are moving, their original positions, their mirrored positions, and any changes in their color or shape. The background is consistently white (0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It acknowledges the uncertainty in the precise mirroring mechanism and suggests further investigation.\n"
