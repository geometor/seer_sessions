"""
The transformation rule is to identify 3x3 blocks in the input grid. If a 3x3 block is entirely filled with a non-zero color, and that block is at the edge of the grid, extend that block by one layer (duplicating the edge row or column) if possible, within the boundary of the output grid. The shape of input and output grids are always identical.

Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were too narrowly focused on extending edges based on *any* 3x3 solid-color block. The additional training examples reveal a more nuanced rule. The key issue is identifying *which* edge to extend and understanding the *constraints* of the extension, not just any 3x3 block triggers an expansion. My first attempt correctly expanded the edge block, but did so *in every case* for every edge. It's clear now that the behavior depends on the location and color of a 3x3 block, and there's a specific directionality and possibly a 'filling in' or padding concept involved, rather than simple extension.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I need to meticulously analyze each input/output pair, focusing on:
    *   The exact location of the 3x3 blocks.
    *   The color of the 3x3 blocks.
    *   Which *specific* edge is modified (if any) and *how* the edge change looks (added rows/columns, mirroring, or something else).
    *   The difference between the input and expected outputs (use code to find
        the difference)
    *   Whether any examples have *no* change, and why.

2.  **Refine Object Identification:**  The "objects" aren't just 3x3 blocks; they're 3x3 blocks with specific edge properties and possibly relationships to other parts of the grid.

3.  **Hypothesis Revision:** Based on the detailed analysis, I will reformulate the natural language program to capture the precise conditions under which the transformation occurs. The key is to move from a "trigger-action" model (any 3x3 block triggers expansion) to a "conditional trigger-action" model (a 3x3 block triggers a *specific, context-dependent* modification).

4.  **Code Adjustment:** After revising the natural language program, I'll be in a better position to generate corrected code, likely involving more specific conditional checks and targeted modifications to the output grid.

**Metrics and Example Analysis (Code Execution):**

I'll use Python code (within this response) to perform a more structured analysis of each example. This will involve:

*   Loading the input/output grids.
*   Checking the dimensions.
*   Identifying 3x3 blocks and their properties (color, edge location).
*   Comparing the input and output to identify the exact changes.

    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)

    rows_out, cols_out = output_grid.shape
    diff = output_grid - input_grid
    print(f"Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"Output shape: {output_grid.shape}")
    # find changes
    if not np.array_equal(input_grid, output_grid):
        row_diffs = np.where(np.any(diff != 0, axis=1))[0]
        col_diffs = np.where(np.any(diff != 0, axis=0))[0]

        print(f"Rows with differences: {row_diffs}")
        print(f"Cols with differences: {col_diffs}")
        for r in row_diffs:
            print(f"Row {r}: Input {input_grid[r,:]} vs. Output {output_grid[r,:]}")
        for c in col_diffs:
            print(f"Col {c}: Input {input_grid[:,c]} vs. Output {output_grid[:,c]}")

                print(f"3x3 block found at ({r}, {c}) with color {block[0,0]}")

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  **Identify 3x3 Blocks:** Examine the input grid to find all 3x3 blocks of uniform, non-zero color.
2.  **Check Edge Condition:** For each identified 3x3 block, determine if it's located at the *top-left corner* of the input grid (row 0, column 0).
3.  **Add a row at bottom:** If a 3x3 block meets the above criteria, add one row to the *bottom* of the output grid.
4.  **The new row color:** The color of this added row will be the same as the color of the 3x3 block at the top-left.
5.  If no such 3x3 blocks exists meeting the criteria at the top-left, then there is no change.

This revised program accounts for the specific location requirement (top-left corner) and the consistent action (adding a row at the bottom with the same color). It addresses the shortcomings of the previous attempt, which incorrectly generalized the extension to all edges and all qualifying 3x3 blocks.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
