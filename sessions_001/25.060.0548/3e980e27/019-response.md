Here's an analysis of the provided examples and results, along with a strategy for refining the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program captured some key aspects of the transformation, but failed to generalize correctly across all training examples. The primary issues are:

1.  **Incomplete Object Handling:** The code doesn't handle all objects and colors correctly. It focuses on specific colors (green, azure, red, yellow) and sides (left, right) but misses or incorrectly handles other objects and transformations.
2.  **Incorrect Movement/Expansion Logic:** The movement and resizing logic for the red and yellow objects is not universally applicable. It works for some cases but fails in others.
3.  **Missing object persistence:** The code doesn't maintain the persistence of unchanged portions of the input, some portions of the input grid that are not explicitly transformed should still be present in the output.
4. **Conditional Size change:** The initial assumption missed that one yellow block is expanding *conditionally* based on its size.

The strategy to address these issues involves:

1.  **Iterative Refinement:** Analyze each example and its result, identify the specific discrepancies, and update both the natural language program and the code accordingly.
2.  **Generalized Object Representation:** Modify the code to handle all objects and colors, not just specific ones.
3.  **Precise Transformation Rules:** Develop more precise and generalizable rules for object movement, resizing, and deletion.
4.  **Object Persistence:** Ensure all unchanged objects, and grid regions are transferred to the output
5. **Conditional Handling:** Refactor code to accommodate conditional changes.

**Metrics and Observations (using Code Execution)**

import numpy as np

def find_objects(grid):
    objects = []
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    rows, cols = grid.shape

    def is_valid(r, c):
        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols

    def dfs(r, c, color, obj_coords):
        if not is_valid(r, c) or visited[r, c] or grid[r, c] != color:
            return
        visited[r, c] = True
        obj_coords.append((r, c))
        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
            dfs(r + dr, c + dc, color, obj_coords)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] != 0 and not visited[r, c]:
                obj_coords = []
                dfs(r, c, grid[r, c], obj_coords)
                objects.append({"color": grid[r, c], "coords": obj_coords})
    return objects

    output_objects = find_objects(output_grid)
    predicted_objects = find_objects(predicted_output)

    print("Input Objects:", input_objects)
    print("Output Objects:", output_objects)
    print("Predicted Objects", predicted_objects)
    print("Input Grid:\n", input_grid)
    print("Output Grid:\n", output_grid)
    print("Predicted Output:\n", predicted_output)
    print("Differences (Output - Predicted):\n", output_grid - predicted_output)

**Example Analysis**
*Example 1:*
-   **Observations**: The Red (2) block stays in the correct position, the green (3) blocks on the left are correctly removed and the yellow block on the right (4) expands and is translated to the left.
- **predicted vs expected** The transform function places the red(2) blocks at the very top and shifts down, but it should remain in place.

*Example 2:*
-   **Observations**: The azure (8) block is removed. The red (2) block and the yellow (4) remain in place.
-   **predicted vs expected**: The transform function removed the azure blocks and partially moves the red block, and places an expanded block on the left, which is not correct. Yellow(4) should not have changed.

*Example 3:*
-   **Observations**: The red block moves up, the yellow (4) block expands and moves left, and the azure (8) blocks on the left is removed.
-   **predicted vs expected**: The transform function removed the azure blocks, moves the yellow block correctly, and partially moves the red block.

*Example 4:*
-   **Observations**: Red block moves up, yellow block expands to the left. green blocks are removed.
-  **predicted vs expected**: The transform function removed the green block, expands and moves the yellow(4) block correctly, and partially moved the red block up, but not correctly

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Identify all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels in the input grid. Each block constitutes an object.
2.  **Determine Dividing Line:** Imagine a vertical dividing line at the center of the grid (`input_grid.shape[1] // 2`).
3.  **Left Side Transformations:**
    *   Remove all green (3) and azure (8) objects located to the left of the dividing line.
4.  **Right Side Transformations:**
    *   Red (2) Object:
        *   If the object has a height of 3 or more, move it up by `original_top_row - calculated_target_row`.  `calculated_target_row` is a fraction of the height, but should not be greater than `original_top_row`.
    *   Yellow (4) Object:
        * If the height of the yellow object is greater than or equal to 3: Move all pixels of this object to the left side of the grid. The moved object should start at column 0, span 3 columns wide, and extend the original height of the yellow object, starting three rows from the bottom.
        * If the height of the yellow object is less than 3: Do not transform.

5.  **Object Persistence:** Any object or pixel not explicitly mentioned in the transformation rules above should remain in its original position in the output grid. Copy these unchanged elements directly from the input to the output.
