The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve replicating and repositioning colored shapes/objects within the grid. There's a sense of \"reflection\" or \"copying\" of patterns, potentially with some spatial constraints. The background is always white (0).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
