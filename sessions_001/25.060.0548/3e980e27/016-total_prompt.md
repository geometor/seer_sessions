Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating colored pixels within a grid. The primary operation appears to be a combination of mirroring and potentially shifting certain colored objects. It's crucial to identify which objects are moving, their original positions, their mirrored positions, and any changes in their color or shape. The background is consistently white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: [1, 10]
    type: single_pixel
  - id: 2
    color: green (3)
    initial_position: [2, 2]
    type: single_pixel
  - id: 3
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: [2, 3:4] # range represents contiguous block
    type: horizontal_block
  - id: 4
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: [3, 2]
    type: single_pixel
  - id: 5
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position: [7, 6]
    type: single_pixel
  - id: 6
    color: red (2)
    initial_position: [7, 7]
    type: single_pixel
  - id: 7
    color: green (3)
    initial_position: [8, 1]
    type: single_pixel
  - id: 8
    color: yellow (4)
    initial_position: [8, 7:8]
    type: horizontal_block
  - id: 9
     color: yellow(4)
     initial_position: [1,11]
     type: single_pixel
  - id: 10
     color: yellow(4)
     initial_position: [2, 9:10]
     type: horizontal_block
  - id: 11
     color: azure(8)
     initial_position: [8:1, 2]
     type: horizontal_block

actions:
  - type: potential_mirror
    axis: vertical  # Hypothesis: mirroring across a vertical axis
    objects: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
  - type: color_grouping # pixels of the same color can form objects
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of non-white pixels. Each block, regardless of size, is considered an object.  Assign unique IDs to all objects based on color and location.

2.  **Vertical Mirroring/Shifting:**
    *   Imagine a vertical axis somewhere near the center of the grid (possibly column-dependent, need to test).
    *   Duplicate objects and swap locations across the hypothetical vertical axis line.
    * It looks like some of the colored objects on the right side of the output grid, look like duplicates from other colored objects on the left, and some colored objects on the left have moved down.

3.  **Combine:** Combine duplicated and original objects into the output grid

This program describes a set of operations that, when performed on the input grid, should produce the output grid. It acknowledges the uncertainty in the precise mirroring mechanism and suggests further investigation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
