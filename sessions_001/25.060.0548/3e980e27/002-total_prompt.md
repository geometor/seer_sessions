<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3488x1744 at 0x7B4BFDB8F3D0>Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9). The primary colors involved seem to be white (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8). The transformation appears to involve replicating and repositioning colored shapes/objects within the grid. There's a sense of "reflection" or "copying" of patterns, potentially with some spatial constraints. The background is always white (0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: shape
    properties:
      - color: variable (1, 2, 3, 4, 8)
      - position: (x, y) coordinates
      - contiguous: true  # Shapes are formed by adjacent pixels of the same color.

actions:
  - name: replicate
    description: Copy a shape to a new location.
  - name: translate
    description: Move existing copy based on original object position
  - name: combine
    description: Merge multiple shapes if overlap occurs

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Shapes are considered adjacent if their pixels are directly next to each other (horizontally or vertically).
  - type: spatial_relationship
    description: original objects and replicated shapes have relative positions.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous shapes (groups of adjacent pixels of the same non-zero color) in the input grid.

2. **Replicate and Translate:** For each identified shape:
    *   Find the bounding rectangle.
    *   Find the relative x and y distance between the shapes.
    *    Create a copy of each original shape.
    *   Move the first object to the location of the second, and the second object to the location of the first.
        *   In *train\_4* example, copy yellow rectangle at position 4, 4 to 8,8 and move it to 8,8 and 4,4.
        *   If there are shapes with two or more colors, move them to be in position of the adjacent shape, in other words, if there are two shapes of 3 pixels, swap the entire collection of those pixels.

3. **Combine (if necessary):** If, after replication and translation, any replicated shapes overlap, combine them into a single shape (this seems less relevant based on given samples, but it is good practice).

4.  **Output:** output the new grid with the replicated shapes and translated.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
