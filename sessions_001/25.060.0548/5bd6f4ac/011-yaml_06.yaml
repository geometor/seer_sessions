task: 0b25c576
facts:
  - observation: Input grids vary in size.
  - observation: Output grids are consistently 3x3.
  - observation: Output grid appears to be a sub-region of the input grid, not a newly constructed object composed by separate elements.
  - observation: Train Example 1,2, and 3 transformation are successful.
  - observation: Train Example 4 transformation are unsucessful.
  - observation: colors are consistent between the section selected in the input and the output
  - hypothesis: A 3x3 region is extracted from input to create output.
  - hypothesis_status: supported, needs rule for position.
