Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The most striking observation is that the output grid seems to be a condensed version of the input, retaining only a subset of the non-zero digits, seemingly from the top right corner of the input grid, and specifically it seems to consistently output a 3x3 grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
task_name: Grid Condensation
input:
  type: 2D Grid
  dimensions: Variable (9x9 in examples)
  elements: Integers (0-9)
  interpretation: Colors
output:
  type: 2D Grid
  dimensions: Fixed (3x3)
  elements: Integers (0-9)
  interpretation: Colors
objects:
  - name: Input Grid
    properties:
      - dimension: 9x9
      - value: integer
  - name: Output Grid
    properties:
      - dimension: 3x3
        -value: integer
actions:
  - name: Select Subgrid
    description: A 3x3 subgrid is selected from the input grid.
  - name: Extract Non-Zero Values
    description: Preserve non-zero values from select area.
relationships:
  - type: Spatial
    description: The output grid appears to correspond to the top-right 3x3 sub-area of non zero values of the input grid.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Focus on the top-right corner of the input grid.
2. **Select Last Non-Zero Element:** find the last non-zero element on each row, this will be the basis of the selection criteria.
3.  **Extract Subgrid:** Extract a 3x3 subgrid from the original input, the
    right boundary is determined by the last non zero elements. Any all zero
    rows that are selected are retained.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the top-right 3x3 subgrid of non-zero elements from the input grid, where all zero rows are kept, but not all zero columns.
