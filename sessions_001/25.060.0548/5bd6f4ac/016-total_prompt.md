Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (9x9) into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid appears to contain various single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of the input, retaining only specific colors/values in a particular arrangement. There is no obvious geometric transformation (rotation, reflection). It seems that some form of filtering and repositioning, or object extraction, is taking place.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves extracting specific colored pixels from a 9x9 input grid and arranging them into a 3x3 output grid.

input_grid:
  dimensions: 9x9
  elements: Single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
  properties:
    - Contains a variety of colors.
    - Some colors appear multiple times.

output_grid:
  dimensions: 3x3
  elements: Single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
  properties:
    - Contains a subset of colors from the input grid.
    - Colors are arranged in a specific order.

transformation:
  type: Filtering and Repositioning/Extraction
  details:
    - Select specific pixel values from the original grid
    - The extracted pixels are from the top right 3x3 sub-grid
    - Other pixels are discarded.
    - Preserve their spatial arrangement withing their origin.

objects:
    - grid:
        - input
        - output
    - pixels: color, location
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Focus:** Isolate the top right 3x3 subgrid of the input grid.
2.  **Extract:** All non-zero values of the subgrid are extracted.
3. **Construct:** Build the output using the extracted subgrid, maintaining the original relative positions of its elements.
4. **Discard:** All other cells are eliminated.

Essentially the input's upper right corner is extracted as the solution.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
