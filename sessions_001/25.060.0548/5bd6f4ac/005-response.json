            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the assumption that the output grid is always a direct 3x3 sub-grid of the input grid, specifically matching:\n\n```\n[[9, 7, 0],\n [4, 8, 4],\n [4, 0, 0]]\n```\nThis assumption worked for the first example but may fail for other examples in the ARC-AGI data.\n\nThe key is to observe the consistent relationship between the input and output grids *across all* training examples, not just the first one. It seems that the core concept of identifying a subgrid exists, but we are hardcoding the output grid as opposed to observing properties that will help us programmatically determine which subgrid.\n\nWe need to generalize how the target subgrid (the output) is identified and extracted. The current method relies on finding an exact match to a predefined pattern.  Instead, we should look for patterns or rules that dictate *which* 3x3 subgrid is selected, based on properties of the input and output grids.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the transformation better, let's look at some metrics and observations for the provided examples.\n\n*Example 1*\n- input shape:(11, 16)\n- output shape: (3, 3)\n- result: correct\n- observation: our code works for the first example\n\n*Example 2*\n- input shape:(14, 13)\n- output shape: (3, 3)\n- result: incorrect, output matched the hardcoded subgrid, not the correct output.\n- observation: This indicates that we're not discerning the selection rule for the subgrid; our hardcoded pattern doesn't match what this example is trying to show us.\n\n*Example 3*\n- input shape:(11, 16)\n- output shape: (3, 3)\n- result: incorrect, output matched the hardcoded subgrid, not the correct output.\n- observation: Confirms the issue from Example 2. The rule is not about matching a specific pattern of '9', '7', '4', '8'.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task_id: d5155fbd\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: [11, 16]\n      output_shape: [3, 3]\n      output_grid: [[9, 7, 0], [4, 8, 4], [4, 0, 0]]\n      subgrid_found: true\n      top_left_corner: [0, 0]  # of the subgrid in the input\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: [14, 13]\n      output_shape: [3, 3]\n      output_grid: [[0, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n      subgrid_found: false # with the incorrect logic\n      correct_top_left: [4,3] # manual review\n  - example_3:\n      input_shape: [11, 16]\n      output_shape: [3, 3]\n      output_grid:  [[0, 0, 7], [0, 8, 0], [7, 0, 0]]\n      subgrid_found: false #with the incorrect logic\n      correct_top_left: [4, 8] # manual review\n  - general:\n      transformation_type: subgrid_extraction\n      output_size: [3, 3] # Consistent across all examples.\n      selection_rule: \"unknown - not a direct match of a fixed pattern\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Input:** A grid of pixels (2D array of integers).\n2.  **Output:** A 3x3 subgrid extracted from the input grid.\n3.  **Process:**\n    *   Examine the *output* grid. It is always 3 x 3\n    *   The output grid always exists as a sub-grid in the input grid\n    *   The current logic attempts to locate a specific subgrid pattern in the input that matches the provided values. However, the target subgrid is NOT determined by matching this literal pattern.\n    *   The selection rule for *which* 3x3 subgrid to extract is not yet determined and will need further iterations of observation and coding.\n4. **Next Step** Review test examples and adjust the rule.\n\n**Next Steps for Improvement**\n\nWe have identified that current logic of using `find_subgrid` is limited because the `output_grid` is a constant. The key is to figure out the selection rule.\nIn the next round, examine the relationship between inputs and outputs, focusing on:\n\n*   Are there any colors or patterns *around* the correct subgrid that might indicate its selection?\n*   Does the position of the correct subgrid within the input grid have any significance (e.g., always centered, always in a corner)?\n*   Try to identify features that can determine selection using code.\n"
