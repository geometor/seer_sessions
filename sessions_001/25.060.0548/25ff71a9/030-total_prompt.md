Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule reflects red pixels across either the horizontal or vertical axis based on the grid's dimensions.

1.  **Examine** the input grid to determine if height is equal to width.
2.  **Identify** the red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.
3.  **If height and width are equal:**
    *   **Reflect** the position of each red pixel across the horizontal axis (x-axis). The new row index will be `height - 1 - old_row_index`, and the column index will remain the same.
4. **If height and width are not equal:**
    *   **Reflect** the position of each red pixel across the vertical axis (y-axis). The new col index will be `width - 1 - old_col_index`, and the row index will remain the same.
5.  **Clear** original positions of the red pixels by making them black.
6. **Update** the position of the red pixels in a copy of the input.
7.  **Return** the modified grid.

    # Find the coordinates of red pixels

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a reflection of red pixels based on the dimensions of the grid (horizontal reflection if square, vertical otherwise). The results show that this approach is partially correct, working for the first example but failing for the second and third. The primary issue is the code doesn't consider other colors and more complex rules. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input/output pair, noting not just the red pixels but all color changes and patterns.
2.  **Metrics Gathering:** Use code execution to extract precise information like the number, color and position of changed pixels.
3. **Object Identification**: The inputs contain objects that must be identified - for example, shapes or collections of pixels of the same color that are adjacent.
4.  **Rule Refinement:** Iteratively update the natural language program to incorporate observations from all examples, moving beyond simple reflection.
5.  **Consider other colors:** we must expand the observation beyond just red pixels.

**Metrics Gathering and Example Analysis**

I'll use `code_execution` to get precise details about the transformations.

def get_grid_differences(grid1, grid2):
    """
    Compares two grids and returns a list of differences.
    Each difference is a tuple: (row, col, old_value, new_value)
    """
    differences = []
    for r in range(grid1.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid1.shape[1]):
            if grid1[r, c] != grid2[r, c]:
                differences.append((r, c, grid1[r, c], grid2[r, c]))
    return differences

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify** the red pixel (value 2) in the input grid.
2.  **Find** the row index of the last row of the grid.
3. **Move** the Red pixel to the last row, keeping the column index the same.
4.  **Return** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
