**input:**
```
1 1 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4BFDBD1B50>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4BFDB8FED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains blue (1) and white (0) pixels. The output grid appears to be a vertically flipped version of the input grid. The colors and the overall grid dimensions remain consistent between input and output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: The input and output are both 3x3 grids.
  - observation: The grids contain two colors, represented by the values 0 (white) and 1 (blue).
  - observation: The output grid is the input grid, flipped vertically.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 1]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      colors: [0, 1]
    relationship: vertical_flip_of(input_grid)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a vertical flip (reflection across the horizontal midline). The output grid is created by inverting the row order of the input grid. Specifically, the top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the output, the middle row stays the same, and the bottom row of the input becomes the top row of the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
