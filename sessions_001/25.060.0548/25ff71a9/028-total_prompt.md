Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule appears to either rotate the red pixels 90 degrees clockwise, OR it reflects the grid along the horizontal axis (x-axis).

1.  **Identify** the contiguous block of red (2) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Rotate** the set of red pixels 90 degrees clockwise within the 3x3 grid. OR
3.  **Reflect** the position of the red pixels across the x-axis

"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    input_grid_shape = input_grid.shape
    # Find the coordinates of red pixels
    red_pixels = np.argwhere(input_grid == 2)

    # Apply 90-degree clockwise rotation OR reflection across x-axis
    for r, c in red_pixels:
      # new_r = c
      #  new_c = input_grid_shape[0] -1 - r
        new_r = input_grid_shape[0] - 1 - r
        new_c = c
        output_grid[r,c] = 0 #clear old position
        output_grid[new_r, new_c] = 2 #set the color

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the code execution on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis was partially correct. The transformation involves manipulating the red pixels (value 2). However, the initial code considered either a 90-degree clockwise rotation *or* a reflection across the horizontal axis. The results show it is only a reflection, but the axis used as mirror depends upon grid properties, the code must be updated to determine the correct axis by examining the input grid shape.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Examine the provided input/output/predicted grids to pinpoint where the transformation logic fails. Specifically, look for the precise relationship for mirroring the red pixels.
2.  **Refine Hypothesis:** Determine the conditions under which the correct reflection needs to happen.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Describe the refined transformation logic clearly and concisely.
4.    Update YAML facts for this new knowledge.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To understand the error patterns, let's quickly examine the provided training examples. We need to know if the height and width are equal or not. We will use code execution to obtain the height and width of each grid.

```python
import numpy as np

def get_grid_dimensions(grid_string):
    grid = np.array(eval(grid_string))
    return grid.shape

# Example usage with the provided training data:
train_examples = [
    {
        "input": "[[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]",
        "output": "[[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]"
    },
    {
        "input": "[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0]]",
        "output": "[[0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]"
    },
   {
        "input": "[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]]",
        "output": "[[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]"
    }
]

for i, example in enumerate(train_examples):
  input_shape = get_grid_dimensions(example["input"])
  output_shape = get_grid_dimensions(example["output"])
  print(f"Example {i+1}: Input Shape: {input_shape}, Output Shape: {output_shape}")
```

**Code Execution Results:**

```text
Example 1: Input Shape: (3, 3), Output Shape: (3, 3)
Example 2: Input Shape: (3, 3), Output Shape: (3, 3)
Example 3: Input Shape: (2, 9), Output Shape: (2, 9)
```

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
  - object: |
      Red pixels (value 2) are the only objects being transformed.
  - transformation: |
      Red pixels are reflected.
      If height and width of the input grid are equal, red pixels are reflected across the horizontal axis.
      If height and width of the input grid are not equal, red pixels are reflected across the vertical axis.
  - constraint: |
      The dimensions of the grid remain unchanged.
      Pixels other than the red ones remain in their original position.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Examine** the input grid to determine if height is equal to width.
2.  **Identify** the red pixels (value 2) in the input grid.
3.  **If height and width are equal:**
    *   **Reflect** the position of each red pixel across the horizontal axis (x-axis). The new row index will be `height - 1 - old_row_index`, and the column index will remain the same.
4. **If height and width are not equal:**
    *   **Reflect** the position of each red pixel across the vertical axis (y-axis). The new col index will be `width - 1 - old_col_index`, and the row index will remain the same.
5.  **Clear** original positions of the red pixels by making them black.
6. **Update** the position of the red pixels in a copy of the input.
7.  **Return** the modified grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
