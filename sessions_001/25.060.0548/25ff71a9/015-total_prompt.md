Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is a simple row shift. The row containing all blue pixels (value 1) is moved from its original position (row 1, the second row which has index 1) to the bottom of the grid (row 2, which has index 2).
The row that was previously at the bottom is shifted upwards to the middle.
Essentially, the rows are rotated downwards by one position.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find the row with all blue pixels (value 1)
    blue_row_index = -1
    for i, row in enumerate(input_grid):
        if np.all(row == 1):
            blue_row_index = i
            break

    # If a blue row is found, perform the row shift
    if blue_row_index != -1:
        # Move the blue row to the bottom
        output_grid[-1, :] = input_grid[blue_row_index, :]
        #shift the other rows
        output_grid[blue_row_index: -1] = input_grid[blue_row_index + 1:]
       
    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
