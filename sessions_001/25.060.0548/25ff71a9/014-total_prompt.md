**input:**
```
0 0 0
1 1 1
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4BFD16BB50>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 0 0
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4BFD168ED0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The input grid has a row of blue pixels (represented by '1') in the middle, while the rest are white pixels (represented by '0'). The output grid has the row of blue pixels at the bottom, and the middle row is now white.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          mapping:
            0: white
            1: blue

transformations:
  - action: move_row
    details: The row of blue pixels is moved from the middle row to the bottom row. Other rows are adjusted accordingly.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is a simple row shift. The row containing all blue pixels (value 1) is moved from its original position (row 1, the second row which has index 1) to the bottom of the grid (row 2, which has index 2).
The row that was previously at the bottom is shifted upwards to the middle.
Essentially, the rows are rotated downwards by one position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
