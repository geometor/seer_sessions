Previous Code:

The function rotates a 3x3 grid 90 degrees clockwise.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.

    Args:
        input_grid: A 3x3 list of lists representing the input grid.

    Returns:
        A 3x3 list of lists representing the rotated grid.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Transpose the array (swap rows and columns).
    transposed_array = input_array.T

    # Reverse each row of the transposed array to achieve a 90-degree clockwise rotation.
    rotated_array = np.flip(transposed_array, axis=1)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list of lists.
    output_grid = rotated_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program and supporting documentation.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to rotate a 3x3 grid 90 degrees clockwise. The test results indicate that this transformation is only partially correct. It works for some examples but fails for others. The core issue seems to be that the transformation isn't simply a 90-degree rotation for all cases, and it fails to generalize for grids that are not 3x3. We need to revise our natural program and, subsequently, the code, based on a more complete analysis of *all* input-output pairs. The strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Examine each input/output pair, not just the first one, paying close attention to differences in object position, size, color, and any other apparent properties.
2.  **Identify common patterns:** Determine a consistent rule or set of rules that explains *all* transformations, not just a subset.
3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the description to accurately represent the identified rule.
4.  **Develop YAML Facts:** construct a series of YAML blocks to capture the objects, their properties, relationships, and state changes.

**Metrics and Observations**

To accurately describe the transformations, I need to analyze each example. I will use a function to programmatically compare the input and output grids and note differences.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(input_grid, output_grid):
    """Compares two grids and returns a description of the differences."""
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)
    output_array = np.array(output_grid)

    if input_array.shape != output_array.shape:
        return "Different dimensions"

    differences = []
    for row_index in range(input_array.shape[0]):
        for col_index in range(input_array.shape[1]):
            if input_array[row_index, col_index] != output_array[row_index, col_index]:
                differences.append(
                    f"Pixel at ({row_index}, {col_index}) changed from "
                    f"{input_array[row_index, col_index]} to {output_array[row_index, col_index]}"
                )
    return differences if differences else "No differences"

The analysis reveals a consistent pattern: a colored rectangle moves to a different part of the grid.  Sometimes it's in the top-left, sometimes bottom-left, sometimes center. It maintains its shape and size.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the single rectangle of color other than black (0) in the input grid. A rectangle is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Determine Movement:** Identify the position of the rectangle within the input.
    - if the rectangle is in the top third of input, move to the bottom third of the grid
    - if the rectangle is in the bottom third of input, move to the center third of the grid
    - if the rectangle is in the center third of input, move to the top third of the grid
3.  **Preserve Shape and size:** Maintain the rectangle's original dimensions (width and height) and color during the move.
4. **Clear previous location:** Set all pixels in the original location to black (color 0).
5.  **Output:** Create an output grid where the identified rectangle is in the determined location with it's original size and shape.

This revised natural language program should capture the consistent movement rule and accurately describe the transformation observed across all training examples. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous "rotate" program by focusing on object identification, relative positioning, and movement based on location.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
