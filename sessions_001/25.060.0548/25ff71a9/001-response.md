Okay, I've reviewed the provided input-output pairs. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color (0-9). The transformation appears to involve a rotation of the grid's contents. The non-zero values seem to be the focus of the transformation, while the zeros act as a background. The transformation maintains the relative positions of colored pixels *within* their original row/column. The overall effect is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: cells
    properties:
      - name: color
        type: integer
        range: [0, 9]

actions:
  - name: rotate_clockwise
    type: grid_transformation
    parameters:
      degrees: 90

relationships:
  - subject: grid
    predicate: contains
    object: cells
  - subject: cell
    predicate: has_color
    object: color_value
  - subject: input_grid
    predicate: transformed_to
    object: output_grid
    transformation: rotate_clockwise

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the input grid:** A 3x3 grid of colored pixels, where each pixel is represented by a digit (0-9).
2.  **Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.** This can be achieved by transposing the grid and afterward reversing order in each row.
3. **Return new grid.** The rotated grid is the output.

In simpler terms: The entire grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Imagine taking the grid and turning it to the right so the top row becomes the rightmost column.
