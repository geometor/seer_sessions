The transformation seems to involve expanding or flood-filling existing non-zero colored pixels horizontally and/or vertically, creating rectangular blocks of the same color. The extent and direction of expansion vary. The background is always 0 (white).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Determine the maximum extent of the horizontal block. The examples have conflicting details about expansion:\n    *   Example 1 indicates that colored pixels form separate horizontal regions.\n    *   Example 2 shows regions merging (green and orange).\n    *   Example 3 shows yellow expands in both directions, to the largest extent.\n\n3. **Vertical Expansion (Secondary, conditional):** Examine the vertical boundaries created by horizontal expansion. Within those vertical boundaries, expand each color vertically:\n     *   Example 1 expands the blue and red to fill the space between the regions\n     *   Example 2 expands orange and green by 1 row, preserving the offset\n     *   Example 3 expands yellow to the top, but the top edge of the object\n     *   Example 4 expands orange to make the top edge of the block align\n\n4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the expanded blocks. All other pixels remain 0 (white).\n\nThe primary rule is horizontal expansion. The vertical is conditional, possibly based on the presence of other object or the top/bottom boundaries.\n"
