Train Set Results:
Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to move forward:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code were a good first attempt, successfully capturing the transformation rule observed in the first training example. However, the subsequent tests reveal that the rule is incomplete. Specifically, the initial rule *only* considers the column position of the non-white pixel to determine the rectangle's width. The additional examples demonstrate that the rectangle's width doesn't *always* extend to the original pixel's column. We need to revise the logic to correctly determine the width of the generated rectangles, and height needs to be determined, too.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the provided input/output/predicted grids. Focus on how the non-white pixels in the input relate to the generated rectangles in the *correct* output. Look for patterns that dictate the size and starting position of the rectangles.
2.  **Refine Observations:** Update the YAML document with precise observations about object properties (rectangles, colors, positions, etc.) and the observed transformations.
3. **Hypothesize alternative width/height rules.** Develop a more complete natural language program that handles cases where the colored bars stop earlier and heights are not always 3.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** We'll use this revised program to generate new code, test it against the examples, and repeat this process until the code correctly transforms all training inputs to their corresponding outputs.

**Metrics and Code Execution:**

**YAML Observations:**

        top_left: [0, 5]
        bottom_right: [2, 5]
        width: 1
        height: 3

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-white pixels in the input grid.
2.  For each non-white pixel:
    *   Create a rectangle of the *same color* as the identified pixel.
    *   The rectangle's *height* is 3.
    *   The rectangle's *width* is 1.
    *  The rectangle's top-left corner aligns with the *row 0 and the column of the original pixel*.
    * The rectangle's bottom-right corner is always two rows below the top-left corner, and in the same column.
3.  Any cells not covered by a colored rectangle are filled with white (0).
4.  Return the resulting grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
