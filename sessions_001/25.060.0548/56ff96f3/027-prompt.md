Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify:** Locate all orange pixels (value 7) in the input grid.
2.  **Determine Shape and Expansion:**
    *   If the orange pixels form a contiguous shape, find the bounding rectangle that encompasses the entire orange shape.
    *   If the orange pixels form a line (horizontal or potentially others), find the row that is *two rows above* the topmost orange pixel.
    * Create a rectangle that starts at the found row, and matches the columns of the original orange pixels.

3. **Fill:**  Fill this determined rectangle with orange pixels in the output grid while keeping dimensions same.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
