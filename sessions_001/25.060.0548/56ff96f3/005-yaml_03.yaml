        - red (2)
      shape: rectangle
      dimensions: height varies. width varies
      anchor:  # the relationship of the input pixel location and output shape
          row: same as corresponding input pixel.
          col: centered on the original input, extends to the left.

actions:
- type: transform_pixel
  input:  single pixel
  output: rectangle of pixels
  transformation_rule: extends the single color into a rectangle shape, centered on initial position, height fixed and length is to column 0.

relationships:
  - object1: input pixel
    object2: output block
    relation: one-to-one correspondence in color
    spatial_relation: output block is centered on the input pixel's original location.
