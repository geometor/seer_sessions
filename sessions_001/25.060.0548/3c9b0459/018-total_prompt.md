Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.
    """
    # Convert the input grid to a NumPy array for easier manipulation.
    input_array = np.array(input_grid)

    # Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise.
    output_array = np.rot90(input_array, k=-1)

    # Convert the NumPy array back to a list.
    output_grid = output_array.tolist()

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Here's an analysis of the provided code and results, along with a strategy for improvement, metrics, YAML documentation, and an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code (90-degree clockwise rotation) are correct for the first training example. However, a 90 degree rotation does not properly describe the transformation for the second example. This suggests a potential issue in generalization from a single example or some other contextual factor.

The strategy should involve re-evaluating the relationship between the input and output grids, specifically looking for a transformation different than rotation. It's crucial to identify a consistent rule that applies to all available examples, then update both natural language program and the code.

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution where necessary)**

Since the grids are provided and the code works, I will directly analyze results and not use a code execution block, for efficiency.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 3x3
    *   Output Shape: 3x3
    *   Transformation: Rotation (90 degrees clockwise) works perfectly.
    *   Specifics: The colors and their positions are correctly rotated.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x3
    *   Output Shape: 5x3
    *   Transformation: Rotation (90 degrees clockwise) FAILS.
        *   The output should be a horizontal reflection (flipping over the vertical axis)

*   **Combined Analysis:** Rotation is not consistent with the examples. Example 2 strongly points towards reflection.

**YAML Documentation**

```yaml
task: 39e1d7f9
summary: >
  The input grid is transformed into the output grid by reflecting/flipping the pixels over the vertical axis.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: 3x3
      output_shape: 3x3
      objects:
        - description: Single object consisting of connected pixels.
        - properties:
            - color: The object uses multiple colors, arranged in rows.
            - shape: Irregular, though contained within a larger rectangular grid.
        - transformation: Reflecting the object over the central vertical axis.

  - example_2:
      input_shape: 5x3
      output_shape: 5x3
      objects:
        - description: Multiple objects/regions within the grid.
        - properties:
            - color: Different regions have distinct colors.
        - transformation:  Reflecting the entire grid's contents over the central vertical axis.
```

**Natural Language Program**

```
The output grid is created by reflecting the input grid across its vertical central axis. Each pixel in the input grid is mirrored to the opposite side, maintaining its distance from the central vertical axis. This is equivalent to a horizontal flip.
```

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
