**input:**
```
3 2 9
9 9 9
2 3 3
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7B4C05BB9450>

**output:**
```
3 3 2
9 9 9
9 2 3
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two 3x3 grids. The grids contain single-digit integers (0-9), each representing a different color. The transformation seems to involve rearranging the elements within the grid, specifically swapping some of the digits/colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: mapped from integer value

actions:
  - type: swap
    parameters:
      - position1: (row, col)
      - position2: (row, col)

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: elements are arranged in a 2D grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule appears to be a series of swaps between specific cells in the grid, specifically swapping colors at defined co-ordinates, regardless of color.:

1.  The element at (0, 0) in the input grid is swapped with the element at (2,0).
2. The element at (0, 1) in the input grid is swapped with the element at (0,2)

In terms of grid coordinates:

*   Swap (0, 0) with (2, 0).
*  Swap (0,1) with (0,2)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
