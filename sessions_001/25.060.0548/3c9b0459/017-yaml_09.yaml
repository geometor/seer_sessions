summary: >
  The input grid is transformed into the output grid by reflecting/flipping the pixels over the vertical axis.

observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: 3x3
      output_shape: 3x3
      objects:
        - description: Single object consisting of connected pixels.
        - properties:
            - color: The object uses multiple colors, arranged in rows.
            - shape: Irregular, though contained within a larger rectangular grid.
        - transformation: Reflecting the object over the central vertical axis.

  - example_2:
      input_shape: 5x3
      output_shape: 5x3
      objects:
        - description: Multiple objects/regions within the grid.
        - properties:
            - color: Different regions have distinct colors.
        - transformation:  Reflecting the entire grid's contents over the central vertical axis.
