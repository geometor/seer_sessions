**Perception of the Task:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The transformation appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid. The colors (represented by numbers) of the individual pixels are preserved, but their positions change according to the rotation.

**YAML Block of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0-9)

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
  - element_of: pixels are elements of the grid
  - transformation: output grid is a rotated version of the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Input:** A 3x3 grid of pixels, each with a color represented by a digit.
2.  **Transformation:** Rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. This means:
    *   The top-left pixel moves to the top-right position.
    *   The top-center pixel moves to the right-center position.
    *   The top-right pixel moves to the bottom-right position.
    *   The center-left pixel moves to the top-center position.
    *   The center-center pixel remains in the center-center position.
    *   The center-right pixel moves to the bottom-center position.
    *   The bottom-left pixel moves to the top-left position.
    *  The bottom-center moves to left-center
    *   The bottom-right pixel moves to the bottom-left position.
3.  **Output:** The rotated 3x3 grid, with each pixel maintaining its original color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
