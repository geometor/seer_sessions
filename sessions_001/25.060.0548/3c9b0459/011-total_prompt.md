Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation performs a reflection of the grid across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) combined with a swap.

1.  First swap element at `grid[0][1]` with element at `grid[1][0]`
2.  Then, the grid is reflected along its main diagonal. This means the element at `grid[i][j]` is swapped with the element at `grid[j][i]`.

In simpler way:

The rows of the input grid appear to become the columns of the output grid, and the columns of input grid appear to become the rows in the output grid, but with elements at `grid[0][1]` with element at `grid[1][0]` being swapped.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Swap elements at [0][1] and [1][0]
    temp = output_grid[0][1]
    output_grid[0][1] = output_grid[1][0]
    output_grid[1][0] = temp    

    # Transpose the grid (reflect across the main diagonal)
    output_grid = np.transpose(output_grid)
    
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
