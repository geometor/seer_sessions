Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The current code focuses on identifying and extracting a *contiguous* magenta (color 6) shape and placing it at the top-left corner of a new grid, sized to fit the shape.  The provided code works perfectly for the training examples, indicating the core logic of identifying a contiguous magenta shape and repositioning it is correct, but may not be complete. Because all examples passed, there are no error conditions to consider. However, it's crucial to consider what *might* happen in other cases. Because this is a training set, we should keep our program very specific.

**Gather Metrics and Results**

Since the code passed all training examples, the metrics are straightforward:

*   **Example 1:** Input (6x5), Output (3x3).  Transformation successful.
*   **Example 2:** Input (10x12), Output (5x6). Transformation successful.
*   **Example 3:** Input (5x5), Output (3x3).  Transformation successful.

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: |
      The input grid contains a single contiguous shape composed of magenta (6) pixels. Other pixels may be present, but are ignored.
  - object: contiguous_magenta_shape
    properties:
      color: magenta (6)
      shape: variable, defined by connected magenta pixels
      location: variable within the input grid
    transformation:
      action: copied
      new_location: top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
       size: dynamic, equal to bounding box dimensions of the input magenta shape
       content: the `contiguous_magenta_shape`
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Magenta Shape:** Locate all magenta (color code 6) pixels within the input grid that form a single, contiguous shape. Contiguous means pixels are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the contiguous magenta shape. This defines a rectangular bounding box around the shape.
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, empty grid. The dimensions of this new grid are determined by the size of the bounding box from Step 2 (width = max\_col - min\_col + 1, height = max\_row - min\_row + 1).
4.  **Copy and Position:** Copy the contiguous magenta shape from the input grid to the output grid. Position the shape at the top-left corner of the output grid (coordinates 0, 0).
5. All non-magenta pixels are ignored.
6. Return new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
