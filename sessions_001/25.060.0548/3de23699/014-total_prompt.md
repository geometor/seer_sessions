Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code focused on identifying "boundary green pixels" – green pixels adjacent to non-white and non-green pixels. This approach worked for the first example but failed on subsequent examples. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't solely about boundary green pixels.  The examples suggest a more complex rule involving identifying green objects and their specific positioning/re-drawing relative to other colors or overall shape. The existing code needs significant adjustments. We need to re-evaluate the core objects, actions, and conditions. It appears that complete green objects (contiguous blocks) that *touch* other non-white colored pixels are preserved, translated to the upper left, and stacked vertically in the output.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1. **Re-examine Object Identification:** Instead of focusing solely on "boundary" green pixels, we need to identify *entire* green objects (contiguous blocks of green pixels).
2. **Re-evaluate the Condition:** The condition isn't just about being next to a non-white/non-green pixel. It seems to be about the green object *touching* any other non-white color.
3. **Understand the Output Construction:**  The output isn't simply a cropped region. It appears green objects meeting the criteria are re-drawn, possibly stacked or re-positioned, in a new grid.  We need to determine the logic for this stacking/positioning.
4. **Iterative Refinement:** We will use the information from *all* training examples to guide the rule formation, not just the first example.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To gather metrics, I'll use a simplified representation focusing on key aspects needed to describe the transformation. I won't be executing code here in the dreamer phase.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** A scattered shape composed of green, yellow and white pixels.
*   **Output:** A solid green rectangle (3x1) in the upper-left.
*   **Initial Code Result:** Correct. The initial code correctly identified the boundary green pixels and created the rectangle.
*   **Observations:** Green pixels adjacent to non-green, non-white pixels form a distinct shape in the output.

**Example 2:**

*   **Input:** Two separate green rectangles, one touching red, one isolated.
*   **Output:** Only the green rectangle touching red is present, moved to the top-left.
*   **Initial Code Result:** Incorrect. The code probably identified boundary pixels from *both* green rectangles, leading to an incorrect output shape and size.
*   **Observations:** The condition involves a green object *touching* another non-white color (red in this case). Isolated green objects are removed.

**Example 3:**

*   **Input:** Three separate green rectangles. One touches blue, and two touch orange.
*   **Output:** Three green rectangles stacked vertically, starting from the top-left.
*   **Initial Code Result:** Incorrect. Similar to Example 2, the boundary pixel approach would fail.
*   **Observations:** Reinforces the "touching" condition. Multiple green objects satisfying the condition are stacked vertically in the output.  The order seems to be from top to bottom and left to right.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: green_object
    definition: A contiguous block of green (3) pixels.
    properties:
      - touching_non_white: Boolean. True if any pixel in the green_object is adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that is not white (0) and not green (3).

actions:
  - name: identify_green_objects
    description: Find all green_objects in the input grid.
  - name: check_touching
    description: For each green_object, determine if it is touching_non_white.
  - name: create_output
    description: Create a new grid.
  - name: stack_objects
    description:  Place green_objects where touching_non_white is True into the output grid, stacked vertically starting from the top-left corner. The objects should maintain their original shape and relative positions.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Green Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of green pixels (green objects) in the input grid.
2.  **Check Touching Condition:** For each green object, determine if it is touching any pixel that is not white (0) and not green (3). "Touching" means adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, initially empty, output grid.
4.  **Stack and Position:** For each green object that satisfies the touching condition, copy it to the output grid. Stack these objects vertically, starting from the top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid. Preserve the shape of each green object. If multiple object are present, order the placement from top-to-bottom, then left-to-right based on the original input position.

This refined natural language program provides a much more accurate and complete description of the transformation rule, incorporating the information from all three training examples. It correctly describes the object identification, the condition for inclusion, and the output construction process.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
