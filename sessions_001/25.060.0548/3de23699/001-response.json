The transformation seems to focus on specific colors within each input grid, extracting and rearranging them to form the output grid. It appears the transformation is not about rotating or simply cropping a region. The output grid is always smaller than the input, and contains some selected, duplicated, and/or rearranged pixels. The selection seems related to identifying specific non-zero colored pixels and their relative positions. In particular there are two colors in each example. The output consists of just one of those colors and they are duplicated\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
