observations:
  - object: yellow_pixels
    property: color: yellow (4)
    property: count: 4
    property: role: corner_markers
    description: >
      These pixels define the corners of an implied rectangle.  They do NOT
      necessarily form the tightest bounding box around the *content* of that
      rectangle, but rather the full extent of the rectangle itself.
  - object: implied_rectangle
    property: shape: rectangle
    description: >
      A rectangular region whose corners are indicated by the yellow pixels.
      The rectangle may extend beyond the minimal bounding box of the yellow pixels
      themselves. All non-yellow pixels within this rectangle are set to white (0)
      in the output.
  - action: crop_and_translate
    description: >
      The implied rectangle defined by the yellow pixels is extracted.
