            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe current code focuses on identifying and extracting a *contiguous* magenta (color 6) shape and placing it at the top-left corner of a new grid, sized to fit the shape.  The provided code works perfectly for the training examples, indicating the core logic of identifying a contiguous magenta shape and repositioning it is correct, but may not be complete. Because all examples passed, there are no error conditions to consider. However, it's crucial to consider what *might* happen in other cases. Because this is a training set, we should keep our program very specific.\n\n**Gather Metrics and Results**\n\nSince the code passed all training examples, the metrics are straightforward:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input (6x5), Output (3x3).  Transformation successful.\n*   **Example 2:** Input (10x12), Output (5x6). Transformation successful.\n*   **Example 3:** Input (5x5), Output (3x3).  Transformation successful.\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - description: |\n      The input grid contains a single contiguous shape composed of magenta (6) pixels. Other pixels may be present, but are ignored.\n  - object: contiguous_magenta_shape\n    properties:\n      color: magenta (6)\n      shape: variable, defined by connected magenta pixels\n      location: variable within the input grid\n    transformation:\n      action: copied\n      new_location: top-left corner (0,0) of the output grid\n  - object: output_grid\n    properties:\n       size: dynamic, equal to bounding box dimensions of the input magenta shape\n       content: the `contiguous_magenta_shape`\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify the Magenta Shape:** Locate all magenta (color code 6) pixels within the input grid that form a single, contiguous shape. Contiguous means pixels are connected horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).\n2.  **Determine Bounding Box:** Find the minimum and maximum row and column indices of the contiguous magenta shape. This defines a rectangular bounding box around the shape.\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new, empty grid. The dimensions of this new grid are determined by the size of the bounding box from Step 2 (width = max\\_col - min\\_col + 1, height = max\\_row - min\\_row + 1).\n4.  **Copy and Position:** Copy the contiguous magenta shape from the input grid to the output grid. Position the shape at the top-left corner of the output grid (coordinates 0, 0).\n5. All non-magenta pixels are ignored.\n6. Return new grid.\n"
