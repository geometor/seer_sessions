task: 77ae1072
facts:
  - example_1:
      input_grid_dims: [9, 11]
      output_grid_dims: [3, 5]
      boundary_pixels: [[0, 4], [0, 6], [4, 4], [4, 6]]  # Deduced visually + from error report
      output_pixels:
        3: 5  # five green pixels in output
        0: 10 # ten empty pixels
      transformation: "Green pixels adjacent to non-white, non-green pixels define a region.  These boundary green pixels are extracted and arranged to form the output. Red pixels are considered boundaries."
      result: Pass
  - example_2:
      input_grid_dims: [10, 8]
      output_grid_dims: [4, 3]
      boundary_pixels: [[1, 3], [1, 4], [6, 3], [6, 4]]  # Deduced visually + from error report
      output_pixels:
        3: 5
        0: 7
      transformation: "Green pixels adjacent to non-white, non-green pixels define a region.  These boundary green pixels are extracted and arranged to form the output. Red pixels are considered boundaries."
      result: Fail
  - example_3:
      input_grid_dims: [7, 9]
      output_grid_dims: [0, 0]
      boundary_pixels: []  # No boundary green pixels found
      output_pixels: {} # empty dictionary
      transformation: "No boundary green pixels are present, so the output is an empty grid."
      result: Fail
general_observations:
  - boundary_definition: "A green pixel is a boundary pixel if it's adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a pixel that is NOT white and NOT green."
  - output_grid: "The output grid's dimensions and the arrangement of green pixels within it are determined by the positions of the boundary green pixels in the input grid."
  - red_pixels: "Red pixels are treated as interior, and can help determine boundary pixels."
