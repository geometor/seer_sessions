Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a grid of colored pixels. The input grid is larger and contains mostly white (0) pixels, with a few pixels of magenta (6) and azure (8). The output grid is much smaller and seems to contain only magenta (6) pixels, arranged in a specific shape. The azure pixels in the input are completely gone in the output and replaced by white (0) pixels. It appears the transformation extracts a specific shape formed by some of the magenta pixels and re-arranges to the top-left corner of new, smaller, grid.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 12 x 14
      - colors: [white, magenta, azure]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 4 x 4
      - colors: [white, magenta]
  - object: magenta_shapes
    type: shape
    properties:
       - color: magenta
       - description: "Two isolated pixels and a 2x2 block, possibly 'L' shaped."
  - object: azure_shape
    type: shape
    properties:
      - color: azure
      - description: "An irregular shape in the center, surrounded by/adjacent to the magenta shapes."
  - action: extraction
    description: "A specific magenta shape is extracted from the input grid."
  - action: reposition
    description: "The extracted shape is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid."
  - action: elimination
      description: "all azure colored pixels are removed"
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Shape:** Locate the 2x2 block of magenta (6) pixels in the input grid. There may be other magenta colored pixels, but only the 2x2 block is of interest.
2.  **Extract Shape:** Extract the 2x2 magenta block along with its immediate magenta colored neighbors.
3. **Remove other colored pixels:** Remove all azure colored pixels from the grid.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid, large enough to contain the extracted shape.
5.  **Place Shape:** Position the extracted shape at the top-left corner of the new grid.
6.  **Fill Remaining:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with white (0) pixels.

Essentially, the rule extracts and repositions a connected component of magenta-colored pixels that form a solid 2x2 square, discarding all other parts of the input grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
