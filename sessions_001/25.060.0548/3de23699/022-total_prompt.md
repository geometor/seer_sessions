Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids containing numerical values representing colors. The input grid is larger (12x18) than the output grid (4x8). The input grid contains sparse arrangements of azure (8) and yellow (4) pixels, while the output grid seems to be a condensed representation focusing solely on the azure (8) pixels. The yellow pixels are completely gone in the output. It seems that groups of azure pixels in specific configurations might influence output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - height: [input: 12, output: 4]
      - width: [input: 18, output: 8]
      - values: [0, 4, 8]  # white, yellow, azure
  - object: pixel
    properties:
      - color: [0, 4, 8] # white, yellow, azure
      - position: (row, column)
  - observation: output_grid_contains_only: [0, 8] #white and azure pixels only
  - observation: input_contains_yellow: true
  - observation: output_contains_yellow: false
  - observation: input_azure_pixels_form: [isolated, pairs]
  - observation: output_positions_seem_related_to_input: [azure positions]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create an empty output grid.
2.  **Azure Pixel Identification:** Iterate through the input grid and identify all pixels with the value 8 (azure).
3.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** It seems we consider 2 x 2 blocks of pixels for analysis. We consider groups of 4 adjacent pixels to check if any are colored blue.
4. **Transformation:** Transform all locations to contain a value of 8 if it or any of its neighbors have this value.
5.  **Output Construction:** Extract to create a new, smaller grid.

Essentially, the transformation identifies azure pixels in the input grid and, based on their location creates an azure pixel in the ouput. Other color pixels, specifically yellow, are entirely disregarded. The output is a different dimension than the input, and is filled with azure or white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
