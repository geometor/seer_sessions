Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 7x7 grid with pixels of colors white (0), yellow (4), and red (2). There's a distinct cross-like shape of red pixels in the center and four isolated yellow pixels in the corners of a larger implied square.
*   **Output:** A 3x3 grid containing only yellow (4) pixels and some white (0). The output seems to be a cropped and color-filtered version of the input, focusing on the yellow pixels. The red pixels are completely absent. The white and yellow arrangement seems to derive from relative position of the original yellow.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: grid_in
    type: grid
    dimensions: 7x7
    elements:
      - color: white #0
        role: background
      - color: yellow #4
        role: corner_markers
      - color: red #2
        role: central_shape
  - id: grid_out
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white #0
      - color: yellow #4

actions:
    - name: extract
      agent: system
      target: grid_in.corner_markers
      description: Identify and keep information related with the yellow pixels.
    - name: crop
      agent: system
      target: yellow and background
      description: Crop the yellow component in the grid to the smallest encompassing boundary
    - name: replace
      agent: system
      target: background color
      description: Background color changed to white.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    subject: grid_in.corner_markers
    relation: form_corners_of_square
    object: null
  - type: spatial
    subject: grid_in.central_shape
    relation: centered_within_square
    object: grid_in.corner_markers
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** Locate the four yellow pixels (color 4) within the input grid. These act as corner markers, defining a conceptual square region within the larger input.
2.  **Ignore Other Elements:** Ignore everything else *except* the yellow pixels.
3.  **Define Bounding Box:** Create the smallest possible rectangular bounding box that encompasses the yellow pixels.
4. **Crop and translate:** Crop the section described by bounding box.
5. **Replace colors:** keep all color 4 intact. Change all other colors to 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
