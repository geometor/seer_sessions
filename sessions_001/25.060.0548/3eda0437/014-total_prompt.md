Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, and correctly identified the basic pattern of replacing three consecutive white pixels with magenta. However, it failed on the other training input/output pairs. The primary reason for failure is that not all the examples only convert horizontal sequences of exactly three white pixels. There are more cases that needs to be discovered. My strategy is to carefully examine each input-output pair, determine the conditions and rules of the transformation.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To get a better sense of the errors and the underlying rules, let's visualize the results. Here is the report.

```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is: In each row of the input grid, replace the *first* three consecutive white (0) pixels with magenta (6) pixels. Leave all other pixels unchanged. If a row does not have at least three consecutive white pixels at the beginning, do not alter the row at all.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
