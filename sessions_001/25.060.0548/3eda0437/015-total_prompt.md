Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is: In each row of the input grid, replace the *first* three consecutive white (0) pixels with magenta (6) pixels. Leave all other pixels unchanged. If a row does not have at least three consecutive white pixels at the beginning, do not alter the row at all.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the rule: replace the first three consecutive white pixels with magenta pixels in each row.
    """
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()  # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input.

    # Iterate over each row
    for row_index in range(output_grid.shape[0]):
        row = output_grid[row_index]

        # Check if the first three pixels are white
        if len(row) >= 3 and all(row[i] == 0 for i in range(3)):
            # Replace the first three pixels with magenta (6)

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
