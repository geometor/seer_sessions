The primary colors observed are blue (1), gray (5), white (0), and magenta (6). The input and output grids have the same dimensions (3x30). The most noticeable change is the appearance of a horizontal magenta line in the output where there wasn't one in the input. This magenta region appears to replace a segment previously containing various colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
