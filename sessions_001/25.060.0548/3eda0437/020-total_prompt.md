Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Blue Islands:** Locate all groups of contiguous blue pixels (value '1'). A group can be from length one to many.

2.  **Targeted Replacement:** Traverse the grid horizontally (row by row). For each row find the areas that begin and end with blue pixels. If such an area exists, change all white pixels within that area to magenta.

3. **Result** All areas on a row between blue groups are turned magenta.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the generated code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were a good first attempt, focusing on identifying blue "islands" and filling the space between them with magenta. However, the test results reveal a flaw in this approach. The code seems to fill not only spaces *between* blue islands, but the space between multiple blue islands and the edges, on each row independently. We need to restrict the filling to only occur between the *outermost* blue pixels on each row, if there are at least two such pixels. The current implementation using `find_blue_groups` finds many groups, which causes this error.

The strategy to resolve the error is to modify the natural language description and the approach used for targeting the area for magenta replacement:

1.  **Simplify Blue Identification**: Instead of finding all blue groups, we just need to identify the *first* and *last* blue pixel in each row.
2.  **Conditional Replacement**: Only replace white pixels with magenta *between* these two blue pixels, and only if there are, at least, two blue pixels on the current row.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

To better understand what is happening, I am going to do a simple analysis using the code. Since I cannot execute code directly, I'll describe what analysis should be performed and summarize what I expect the results to be.

*Code Execution Analysis (Hypothetical)*

For each training example (input and output grids):

1.  Print the input grid.
2.  Print the output grid (from the `transform` function).
3.  Print the expected output grid.
4.  Compare the output grid with the expected output grid, highlighting any discrepancies.
5. For each row, find the start and end index using `find_blue_groups`

*Expected Results Summary*

| Example | Input Summary                                   | Expected Output Summary                                      | Actual Output Summary                                               | Discrepancy                                                                                                                               |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Blue pixels at start/end of some rows.          | White between blue becomes magenta.                       | Same as expected.                                                   | None.                                                                                                                                    |
| 2       | Blue pixels in middle of some rows; no edges. | White between leftmost & rightmost blue becomes magenta.  | Incorrect: Spaces between multiple blue and edges are also filled. | Actual output fills too much; only the space between the *outermost* blue pixels on each row should be filled.                      |
| 3       | Single blue pixels, no edges | No changes                                                | Incorrect: fills from the single group to the end of the row                                         | Fills areas with just one blue. |

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - pixels: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - rows: horizontal lines of pixels
      - columns: vertical lines of pixels

  - name: blue_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: blue (value 1)

  - name: white_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: white (value 0)

  - name: magenta_pixel
    type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: magenta (value 6)

actions:
  - name: find_outermost_blue
    description: Locate the first and last blue pixels in a row.
    input: row (1D array of pixels)
    output: (start_index, end_index) or None

  - name: replace_white_with_magenta
    description: Change white pixels to magenta within a specified range.
    input: row, start_index, end_index
    output: modified row
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Iterate through Rows:** For each row in the input grid:
2.  **Find Outermost Blue Pixels:** Find the index of the first and the last blue pixel (value '1') in the current row.
3.  **Conditional Replacement:** If both a first and last blue pixel were found (i.e., there are at least two blue pixels in the row), iterate through the pixels *between* these two indices (exclusive of the blue pixels themselves).
4.  **Change White to Magenta:** Within this range, change any white pixel (value '0') to magenta (value '6').
5.  **Output:** The resulting grid after processing all rows is the output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
