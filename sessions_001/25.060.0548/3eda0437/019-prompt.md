Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Blue Islands:** Locate all groups of contiguous blue pixels (value '1'). A group can be from length one to many.

2.  **Targeted Replacement:** Traverse the grid horizontally (row by row). For each row find the areas that begin and end with blue pixels. If such an area exists, change all white pixels within that area to magenta.

3. **Result** All areas on a row between blue groups are turned magenta.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
