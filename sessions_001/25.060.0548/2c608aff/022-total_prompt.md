Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are grids of the same dimensions.
*   The grids mostly consist of blue (1) pixels.
*   There are isolated yellow (4) pixels scattered within the blue background.
*   There is a rectangular block of gray (5) pixels in the center-left part of the input grid.
*   In the output, some of the yellow pixels, that were diagonally adjacent, have been connected, forming lines

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [14, 18] # Height, Width
      elements: pixels
      background_color: blue (1)

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - blue (1)
        - yellow (4)
        - gray (5)

  - type: shape
    properties:
        shape_type: rectangle
        color: grey (5)
        position: center-left
        
actions:
 - type: connect
   description: Connect diagonally adjacent yellow pixels
   condition: yellow (4) pixels that are diagonally adjacent to each other in the input

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - type: containment
    description: The grid contains all pixels and shapes.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all yellow (4) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** all grey(5) pixels in the input grid.
3.  **Check** for diagonally adjacent yellow pixels.
4.  **Change** the blue (1) pixels to the yellow (4) on the diagonal path
    between any adjacent yellow pixels.
5.  **Preserve** all other pixels, keeping their original colors (including the
    gray (5) pixels).

Essentially, the transformation extends the yellow pixels along diagonal
lines, but only those that are diagonally connected. The gray rectangle
remains unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
