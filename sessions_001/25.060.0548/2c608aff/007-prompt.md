Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all pixels with color green (3), yellow (4), and azure (8).

2.  **Green Region Influence:** Consider the rows containing the green (3) region.

3.  **Yellow Pixel Extension:** Yellow (4) pixels on rows containing green (3) extend to the left, replacing azure (8) pixels until a non-azure pixel is encountered.

4. **Yellow Pixels on Rows without Green**
    If a row with yellow pixels does *not* contain green:
    - If there's *more than one* yellow pixel, they all remain and extend.
    - extend to the left replacing any azure.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
