Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. Identify the background: The background is red (2) and remains unchanged.
2. Locate the azure pixel: Find the single azure (8) pixel within the input grid.
3. Vertical Expansion: Transform the azure pixel into a vertical line of azure pixels. 
   The line starts at the row where the azure pixel was found.  The bottom of the line
   will be in the row one above the final row of the input. The azure line does not
   change columns.
4. Return the modified grid: The output grid is identical to the input grid except for
   the expanded azure line.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and corresponding code were based on the first training example. The code correctly identifies the azure pixel and extends it vertically downwards, stopping one row above the bottom. This works for the first two examples. However, the third example reveals a flaw: when the azure pixel is already in the second to the last row, it should still transform. The current function does not modify the pixel in the edge case.

The strategy to resolve this is to adjust the vertical expansion logic. Instead of stopping the expansion one row *above* the last, the expansion should fill all the way down to the last row.

**Metrics and Observations**

To better understand the transformations, I'll use a structured approach to describe what I observe in the input/output pairs. I'll use numpy to help confirm these properties programmatically, and I'll summarize my findings.

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison of expected and actual outputs:

*   **Example 1:**

    *   Input Shape: (6, 5)
    *   Azure Pixel Location (Input): (1, 2)
    *   Expected Output: Azure line from (1, 2) to (4, 2) - note function extends to (4,2) which is correct
    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.
*   **Example 2:**

    *   Input Shape: (6, 7)
    *   Azure Pixel Location (Input): (4, 3)
    *   Expected Output: Azure line from (4, 3) to (4, 3)
    *   Actual Output: Matches the expected output.
*   **Example 3:**

    *   Input Shape: (5, 5)
    *   Azure Pixel Location (Input): (3, 2)
    *   Expected Output: Azure line from (3, 2) to (4,2) - note function stops at (3,2) which is incorrect
    *   Actual Output: **Does not** match, no changes. The code did not modify the grid because it stops expansion one row above the bottom and the azure pixel is in the second-to-last row.

    azure_pixels = np.where(grid == 8)
    if azure_pixels[0].size > 0:

    else:
        azure_row, azure_col = None, None

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_set: "training"
    background:
      color: "red"
      persistence: "unchanged"
    object:
      color: "azure"
      initial_shape: "pixel"
      transformation:
        type: "vertical expansion"
        direction: "downward"
        extent: "to the last row"
        constraints:
          column: "remains constant"
    notes: "The azure pixel expands into a vertical line that extends to the bottom row of the grid, maintaining its original column."
```

**Revised Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the background:** The background is red and remains unchanged throughout the transformation.
2.  **Locate the azure pixel:** Find the single azure pixel within the input grid.
3.  **Vertical Expansion:** Transform the azure pixel into a vertical line of azure pixels. The line starts at the row where the azure pixel was found and extends downwards to the *last* row of the grid. The azure line does not change columns.
4.  **Return the modified grid:** The output grid is identical to the input grid except for the expanded azure line.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
