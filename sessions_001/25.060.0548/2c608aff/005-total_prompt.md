Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the color green (3) and yellow (4).

2.  **Green Region Influence:** Consider the rows containing the green (3) region.

3.  **Yellow Pixel Extension:** Identify the yellow (4) on row 7. It extends to the left, changing all azure (8) pixels to yellow (4) on those rows, and stops when there are no more azure pixels before hitting the green region.

4.  **Isolated Yellow Pixel:** The yellow (4) that is alone and is on the same rows as the green pixel is not extended. The single yellow pixel on a row that does not contain any green is deleted/turned azure.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
