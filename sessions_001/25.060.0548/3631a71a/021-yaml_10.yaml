  task_type:  Pattern Recognition and Selective Modification
  objects:
    - type: Grid
      properties:
        dimensions: 30x30
        cells:  Pixels with color values (0-9)
    - type: Pixel
      properties:
        color:  Integer (0-9) representing a specific color
        position: (row, column) coordinates within the grid
  actions:
    - type: comparison
      description: compare input to output to discern change
    - type:  Selective Modification
      description: Based on the identified pattern, certain groups are deleted, some are modified, and some are kept.
  relationships:
    - adjacency: Neighboring pixels and their colors seem potentially relevant.
