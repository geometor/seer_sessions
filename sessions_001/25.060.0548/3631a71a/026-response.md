1.  **Identify Connected Components:** For the entire input grid, find all connected components (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color).
2.  **Identify Changed Pixels:** Compare the input and output grids pixel by pixel. Note the locations (row, column) of any pixels that have a different color in the input and output grids.
3.  **Component Removal Rule:** For each connected component in the *input* grid:
    *   If *any* pixel within the component is in the set of changed pixels, remove the entire component from the output.
    *   Otherwise, keep the entire component in the output.
