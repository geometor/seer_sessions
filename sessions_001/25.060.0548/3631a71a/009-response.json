My goal is to discern the transformation rule by observing the changes between the input and output grids.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe input and output grids are 30x30 matrices filled with digits representing colors. The primary elements seem to be:\n\n*   **Pixels:** Individual cells in the grid, each having a color value (0-9).\n*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color.\n*   **Background:** The white color (0) seems to act as a background in most cases.\n*  **Transformations**: I can only see subtle transformations to objects in the scene.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

It looks as if regions with digits '9' are replaced with the surrounding value in the region of interest, the southeast quadrant.\n\n3. Preserve the scene in all other areas.\n\nThe transformation appears to use the input as a mask for selecting boundaries and some color values for masking to preserve the original values.\n"
