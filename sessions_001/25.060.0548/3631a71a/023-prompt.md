Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Iterate through each pixel of the input grid.
2.  Compare each pixel in input to the corresponding pixel in the output.
3.  Identify Changes: Find every pixel where a value is deleted or changed.
4.  Find the group. For each such pixel, trace the entire contiguous block of pixels of the original color.
5.  Delete Some Groups: Certain color connected groups that change will be removed in their entirety.
6. Keep Groups that are Unchanged: If a colored connected group does not change, then keep the group.
7. Change Other Groups: If a colored connected group changes, remove the color values that are nines.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
