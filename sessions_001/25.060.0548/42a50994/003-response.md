Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid (2D array) of numbers, where each number likely represents a color. The primary color observed is '8' (azure) against a background of '0' (white). The transformation appears to selectively remove some of the azure pixels. The overall shape and structure of the azure regions is roughly preserved, but some "island" pixels and some pixels on the edge are erased. There appears to be a constraint against removing pixels in a way that splits a connected block, and it does not erase a single connected azure region completely.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 16
      columns: 11
      cell_values: [0, 8]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - white # Value 0
        - azure # Value 8
      state:
        - present
        - removed
  - type: azure_region
    properties:
      connectivity: connected

actions:
  - type: removal
    target: pixel
    condition:
        - isolated azure pixels are removed
        - azure pixels on specific edges are removed

relationships:
  - adjacency: pixels are adjacent horizontally and vertically
  - connectivity: azure pixels form connected regions
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Pixels:** Locate all pixels with the value '8' (azure) within the input grid.

2.  **Analyze Connectivity:** Determine connected regions of azure pixels. Pixels are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.

3.  **Conditional Removal**:
    *   Iterate over azure pixels.

    *   If an azure pixel is a part of the perimeter, remove this unless it has a neighbor that is part of the same perimeter.

    *   Remove "island" azure pixels that does not have azure neighbors

4.  **Output:** Generate the modified grid, where the selected azure pixels have been replaced with '0' (white).
