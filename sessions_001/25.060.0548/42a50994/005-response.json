            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code implements the initial natural language program, focusing on identifying and selectively removing azure pixels based on whether they are \"islands\" or on the \"perimeter\". The test results show that while the code works correctly for the first training example, it fails on others. This suggests the initial program, while partially correct, is incomplete or contains incorrect assumptions about the transformation rule.\n\nThe core strategy to resolve errors is to:\n\n1.  **Carefully Examine Each Example:** Analyze each input/output pair, paying close attention to the differences and the specific conditions under which azure pixels are removed or retained.\n2.  **Refine Conditions:** The current conditions (island and perimeter) are likely too simplistic. We need to identify more nuanced conditions based on the neighborhood of the azure pixels.\n3.  **Iterative Adjustment:** Iteratively adjust the natural language program and the code, testing after each adjustment to converge on the correct transformation.\n4. Use Code Execution Metrics: Add code execution blocks to generate helpful metrics about assumptions and hypotheses to improve the natural language program.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each training example, along with an analysis of the code's output and identified errors:\n\n```tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n    \"\"\"Gets the valid neighbors of a cell in a grid.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    neighbors = []\n    for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc\n        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n            neighbors.append((nr, nc))\n    return neighbors\n\ndef is_island(grid, row, col, color):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a pixel is an 'island' (no neighbors of the same color).\"\"\"\n    if grid[row,col] != color:\n        return False\n\n    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(grid, row, col):\n        if grid[nr, nc] == color:\n            return False  # Has a neighbor of the same color\n    return True\n\ndef is_perimeter(grid, row, col, color):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a given cell is a perimeter of the given color\"\"\"\n    if grid[row, col] != color:\n      return False\n\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    if row == 0 or row == rows-1 or col == 0 or col == cols -
