Diagonals appear *not* relevant.\n    * Determine how many direct horizontal/vertical neighbors have the *same color*.\n3. **Filter Based on Neighbor Count:**\n    * If a target pixel, call it P, has *one or more neighbors of the same color*, *retain P*. In other words *remove P* if it has *no* horizontal or vertical neighbors of the same color.\n    *   If a target pixel has *zero* neighbors of the same color, remove the pixel (change its color to 0).\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation keeps colored pixels that are directly touching at least one other pixel of the same color, horizontally or vertically. Isolated colored pixels are removed.\n"
