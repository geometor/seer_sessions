Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is: Iterate through all gray (5) pixels in the input grid.
If a gray pixel has another gray pixel immediately to its right, change the right-side gray pixel to white (0).
Essentially, this removes the right-most gray pixels of any horizontal two-or-more sequence of gray pixels.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule."""

    # Initialize output_grid as a copy of the input_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])

    # Iterate through each cell of the grid
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):

            if input_grid[i][j] == 5:
                # Check if there's a pixel to the right and if it's also gray
                if j + 1 < cols and input_grid[i][j + 1] == 5:

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
