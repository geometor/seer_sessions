observations:
  - object: gray_region
    description: One or more connected gray pixels.  Connectivity is defined as adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
    properties:
      - shape: Can be a single pixel, a horizontal line, a vertical line, or a more complex shape.
      - extent: The total number of pixels in the connected region.
    actions:
      - modified:  Gray regions are potentially modified based on their shape and connectivity.

  - object: pixel
    description: A single cell.
    properties:
      - color:  Can be gray (5) or other colors.
      - location:  Row and column index.
      - adjacent_pixels: pixels to the north, south, west, east.
    actions:
      - color_change: the color changes from 5 (gray) to 0 (white).

transformation_rule:
    condition: if a pixel is part of gray region.
    action: if pixel is part of a grey_region and is not on the western-most boundary of that region, change it to color 0 (white)
