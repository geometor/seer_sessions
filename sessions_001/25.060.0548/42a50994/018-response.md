"""
1.  **Identify Gray Regions:** Find all connected regions of gray (5) pixels.  A region is defined as one or more gray pixels that are directly adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically, but *not* diagonally).
2.  **Process Each Region:** For each identified gray region:
    *   Iterate through each pixel of the gray region.
    *   If a pixel is gray and not on the *western-most edge* of the grid/region, change its color to white (0). The western-most gray pixel of each region is the pixel with the lowest column index within the connected region.
    *   If a pixel is gray and it is the western-most edge of the grid/region, it remains unchanged.
