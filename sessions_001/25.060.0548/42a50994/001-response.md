Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and a proposed natural language program for the transformation:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves 2D grids of varying sizes.
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.
*   The primary operation appears to be selective removal or filtering of colored pixels.
*    Some colored pixels are maintained based it seems on their spatial configuration.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - rows: integer
      - columns: integer
      - cells:
          type: array
          items:
            type: integer
            description: "Represents a color (0-9)"

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer
      - row: integer
      - column: integer

actions:
  - name: filter_pixels
    description: "Removes pixels based on color and position"
    parameters:
      - color: integer
      - position_criteria: string # e.g., "isolated", "connected"

relationships:
    - type: "spatial"
      description: "Pixels can be adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Pixels:** For each input grid, identify all pixels that are *not* black (color 0). These are the "target" pixels.
2.  **Check for Adjacency:** For each target pixel:
    *   Examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right). Diagonals appear *not* relevant.
    * Determine how many direct horizontal/vertical neighbors have the *same color*.
3. **Filter Based on Neighbor Count:**
    * If a target pixel, call it P, has *one or more neighbors of the same color*, *retain P*. In other words *remove P* if it has *no* horizontal or vertical neighbors of the same color.
    *   If a target pixel has *zero* neighbors of the same color, remove the pixel (change its color to 0).

In simpler terms, the transformation keeps colored pixels that are directly touching at least one other pixel of the same color, horizontally or vertically. Isolated colored pixels are removed.
