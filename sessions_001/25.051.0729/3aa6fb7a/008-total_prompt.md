Okay, let's analyze the transformation rule based on the provided examples.

**YAML Description of Observations**

```yaml
task: Place_Blue_Cells_Near_Isolated_Azure
observations:
  - objects:
      - type: Isolated Azure Cells
        color: 8 (azure)
        property: Isolated (no adjacent cells of the same color, including diagonals)
      - type: Blue Cells
        color: 1 (blue)
        property: Placed based on the position of isolated azure cells.
  - patterns:
      - The placement of blue cells (color 1) is directly related to the positions of isolated azure cells (color 8).
  - relationships:
      - The *topmost* isolated azure cell has a blue cell placed to its *right*.
      - *All other* isolated azure cells have a blue cell placed to their *left*.
```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1. **Identify Isolated Azure Cells:** Find all cells with the color azure (8) that are isolated. A cell is considered isolated if none of its eight neighboring cells (including diagonals) have the same color (azure).

2. **Sort Isolated Azure Cells:** Sort the isolated azure cells based on their row index, from top to bottom.

3. **Topmost Azure Cell Rule:** For the topmost isolated azure cell (the first one in the sorted list):
   - If there is space to its right (i.e., it's not in the last column), place a blue cell (color 1) directly to the right of this azure cell.

4. **Other Azure Cells Rule:** For all other isolated azure cells in the sorted list:
    - if there is space to the left (i.e., it's not on the first column) place a blue cell (color 1) directly to the left of each of these azure cells.

5. **No other Changes**: The rest of the input grid must remain unchanged.

**Explanation and Improvements to the Previous Code:**
The previous code was a good start, but it had problems.
1. It does not perform any replacement of the input values in output grid.
2. It's missing the placement of the blue squares, hence the observed output grids consisting only of the original inputs.

The natural language program describes this rule correctly.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
