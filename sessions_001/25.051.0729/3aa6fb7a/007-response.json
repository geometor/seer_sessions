A cell is considered isolated if none of its eight neighboring cells (including diagonals) have the same color (azure).\n\n2. **Sort Isolated Azure Cells:** Sort the isolated azure cells based on their row index, from top to bottom.\n\n3. **Topmost Azure Cell Rule:** For the topmost isolated azure cell (the first one in the sorted list):\n   - If there is space to its right (i.e., it's not in the last column), place a blue cell (color 1) directly to the right of this azure cell.\n\n4. **Other Azure Cells Rule:** For all other isolated azure cells in the sorted list:\n    - if there is space to the left (i.e., it's not on the first column) place a blue cell (color 1) directly to the left of each of these azure cells.\n\n5. **No other Changes**: The rest of the input grid must remain unchanged.\n\n**Explanation and Improvements to the Previous Code:**\nThe previous code was a good start, but it had problems.\n1. It does not perform any replacement of the input values in output grid.\n2. It's missing the placement of the blue squares, hence the observed output grids consisting only of the original inputs.\n\nThe natural language program describes this rule correctly.\n"
