            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples and formulate a refined natural language program and corresponding Python code.\n\n**Observations and YAML Summary (Combined for Brevity)**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 010_place_blue_near_azure\nobjects:\n  isolated_azure:\n    description: Single azure (8) cells that are not adjacent (even diagonally) to other azure cells.\n    properties:\n      color: 8\n      isolated: True  # Custom property to denote isolation\n  blue_marker:\n    description: Blue (1) cells placed near isolated azure cells.\n    properties:\n      color: 1\n\ntransformations:\n  - description: Place a blue cell to the right of the topmost isolated azure cell.\n    condition: The azure cell is the topmost isolated one.\n    action: Place blue (1) to the immediate right.\n  - description: Place a blue cell to the left of any other isolated azure cell.\n    condition: The azure cell is isolated but *not* the topmost.\n    action: Place blue (1) to the immediate left.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Isolated Azure Cells:** Find all azure (8) colored cells in the input grid that are *isolated*. An isolated cell is one that has no adjacent cells of the same color, including diagonally adjacent cells.\n\n2.  **Sort Isolated Cells:** Sort the isolated azure cells by their row index (top to bottom). This establishes a clear order of precedence.\n\n3.  **Topmost Rule:** For the *topmost* isolated azure cell (the first one in the sorted list), place a blue (1) cell immediately to its *right*.\n\n4.  **Other Isolated Cells Rule:** For all *other* isolated azure cells (those not the topmost), place a blue (1) cell immediately to their *left*.\n\n5. **Boundary conditions:** Ensure that placement of the blue cells is performed with boundary checking, which means to not perform a placement that goes outside of the grid.\n\n**Reasoning for the Previous Failures and Refinements**\n\nThe previous code failed because it did not *actually* place the blue cell to the right for the topmost isolated azure cell, and to the left for the other isolated azure cells. The images confirm this, showing no placement was made. The condition of isolated cells was calculated correctly, but the placement of the blue cells wasn't. I am fixing the placement and also improving the description.\n\n**Revised Python Code**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nTransforms the input grid by placing blue cells (color 1) near isolated azure cells (color 8).\nThe topmost isolated azure cell gets a blue cell to its right, and all other isolated azure cells get a blue cell to their left.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_isolated_cells(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds isolated cells of a given color, considering diagonal adjacency.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    isolated_cells = []\n\n    def is_isolated(r, c):\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                    continue\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr, nc] == color:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r, c] == color and is_isolated(r, c):\n                isolated_cells.append((r, c))\n    return isolated_cells\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)\n    rows, cols = output_grid.shape\n\n    # Find isolated azure (color 8) cells\n    isolated_azure_cells = find_isolated_cells(input_grid, 8)\n\n    # Sort isolated cells by row\n    isolated_azure_cells.sort()\n\n    # Apply the transformation based on the position of isolated azure cells\n    if isolated_azure_cells:\n        # Top isolated azure cell: place blue cell to the right\n        top_azure_row, top_azure_col = isolated_azure_cells[0]\n        if top_azure_col + 1 < cols:  # Check bounds\n            output_grid[top_azure_row, top_azure_col + 1] = 1 # Place blue cell\n\n        # All other isolated azure cells: place blue cell to the left\n        for i in range(1, len(isolated_azure_cells)):\n            azure_row, azure_col = isolated_azure_cells[i]\n            if azure_col - 1 >= 0:  # Check bounds\n                output_grid[azure_row, azure_col - 1] = 1 # Place blue cell\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\nThe code and natural language program are now consistent and address the identified issues. The crucial change is in the placement, with corrected placement of the blue pixels, to the right of the topmost isolated azure cell, and to the left of other isolated azure cells.\n"
