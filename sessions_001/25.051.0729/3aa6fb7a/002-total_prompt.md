Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
        shape: Two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles and two separate single azure cells
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]
        shape:  Two separate 2x1 vertical rectangles and two separate single azure cells
      - color: 1 (blue)
        positions: [(1,2), (4,4)]
        shape: Two single blue cells.

```

**Natural Language Program: Step-by-Step Transformation**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we see there are two azure (color 8) 2x1 rectangles and two separate single azure (color 8) cells .

2.  **Detect Changes**: Compare to find changes with respect to the input grid.
    -   There are two new single blue cells, added to the output grid.

3.  **Infer Rule:**
    -   Locate the two single azure cells in the input that are separated.
    -   The cell to the right of the single azure cell on the top, becomes blue.
    -   The cell to the left of the single azure cell at the bottom, becomes blue.
    -   All the other cells are unchanged.

**Summary**

The transformation rule involves the addition of two blue cells (color 1) in specific positions related to isolated azure cells. One blue cell is placed to the right of the top-isolated azure cell, and the other is placed to the left of the lower-isolated azure cell. The two azure vertical rectangles do not seem to have any influence over the transformation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{ natural language description of the transformation rule }
"""

{ imports }

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
