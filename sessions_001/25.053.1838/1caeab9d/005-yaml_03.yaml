observations:
  - type: stacking
    description: Objects of the same color stack on top of each other.
  - type: blocking
    description: Objects are blocked by objects of different colors.
  - type: movement
    description: Objects move down as far as possible, subject to constraints.
  - type: color_specific_behavior
    description: All colored objects exhibit same behavior. Only colors 1, 2, and 4 are involved.
