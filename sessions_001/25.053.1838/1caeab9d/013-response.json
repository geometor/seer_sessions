The input grid contains several distinct colored objects (blue, red, and yellow) against a background of white pixels (represented by the value 0). The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input grid. The key difference appears to be a vertical stacking or merging of objects of the same color that are vertically adjacent, and the removal of the top row and right-shifting of items in the case where objects in a row are eliminated..\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
