            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of identifying 2x2 squares and applying specific movement rules based on color was partially correct but highly flawed. The code fails to accurately capture the positional swaps and movements, especially in more complex scenarios like example 2 and 3. The assumption that only 2x2 squares exist needs to be critically re-evaluated and likely removed since a quick glance shows individual pixels of each color in Example 3.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the errors involves:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluating Object Definition:** The code currently assumes that objects are strictly 2x2 squares. This is incorrect, especially evident in example 3. We need to redefine \"object\" more flexibly, potentially as contiguous regions of the same color, not size constrained.\n2.  **Precise Movement Rules:** Instead of hardcoded row shifts, we need to observe the *relative* position changes between input and output. This involves tracking the initial and final positions of each colored \"object\" and generalizing the transformation rule.\n3. **Addressing Example-Specific Failures:** We need to examine why each example fails and adjust the rules accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, noting key observations:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Objects:** 2x2 Red, 2x2 Blue, 2x2 Yellow squares.\n    *   **Transformation:** Red moves down one row. Blue and Yellow swap vertically.\n    * **Code Failure:** Swapping and other object logic is not working as intended. Blue is copying into yellow's position.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Objects:** 3x2 Red, 3x2 Blue, and 3x2 Yellow.\n    *   **Transformation:** Red moves down, and blue moves up. Blue and Yellow swap.\n    *   **Code Failure**: The size is different. Again, blue copies into yellow, but it's not swapping. The 2x2 assumption fails.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Objects:** Single pixels of Red, Blue, and Yellow.\n    *   **Transformation:** Red moves down one, Blue stays, and Yellow stays. The columns are lined up between Input and expected.\n    *   **Code Failure**: The 2x2 assumption makes finding objects useless.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    objects:\n      - color: red\n        initial_position: [0, 1]  # Top-left corner\n        shape: 2x2\n        final_position: [1, 1] # Top-left\n      - color: blue\n        initial_position: [1, 7]\n        shape: 2x2\n        final_position: [1, 7]\n      - color: yellow\n        initial_position: [2, 4]\n        shape: 2x2\n        final_position: [2,4]\n  - example_id: 2\n    objects:\n      - color: red\n        initial_position: [2, 1]\n        shape: 3x2\n        final_position: [5,1]\n      - color: blue\n        initial_position: [5, 4]\n        shape: 3x2\n        final_position: [5, 4]\n      - color: yellow\n        initial_position: [0, 7]\n        shape: 3x2\n        final_position: [5,7]\n  - example_id: 3\n    objects:\n      - color: red\n        initial_position: [1, 3]\n        shape: 1x1\n        final_position: [2,3]\n      - color: blue\n        initial_position: [2, 1]\n        shape: 1x1\n        final_position: [2, 1]\n      - color: yellow\n        initial_position: [3, 6]\n        shape: 1x1\n        final_position: [2,6]\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find contiguous regions (or single pixels) of the same color. These are our \"objects.\" Record their color, initial top-left position, and dimensions.\n2. **Determine Object Sets:** Group the colored objects (red, blue, yellow).\n3.  **Apply Transformation Rules:**\n    *   The objects are aligned into the same columns.\n    *   All objects shift down by one row, *except* if an object of a different color would be overwritten.\n\n"
