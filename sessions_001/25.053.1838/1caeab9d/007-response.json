There are distinct rectangular blocks of uniform color: red (2), blue (1), and yellow (4). The background is white (0). The transformation appears to involve a rearrangement of these colored blocks. The primary action seems to be a horizontal merge or concatenation of the colored blocks.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
