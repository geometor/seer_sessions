This suggests a process of abstraction or summarization, potentially focusing on specific features or regions within the input grid. The colors present in both input and output grids overlap, indicating that color information is likely important to the transformation. The large, contiguous blocks of color (especially azure '8') in the input grid are not present in the output grid. It's likely that the transformation involves identifying and simplifying, or extracting features within the input.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
