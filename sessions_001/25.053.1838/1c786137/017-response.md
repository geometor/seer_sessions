"""
The transformation rule is a rearrangement of the pixels within the grid. Each contiguous block of pixels of the same color (an "object") maintains its integrity (pixels stay connected), but the position of these objects within the grid changes. The total number of pixels of each color remains constant between the input and output. The rearrangement logic is not yet clear, but it *preserves color counts and object contiguity*.
