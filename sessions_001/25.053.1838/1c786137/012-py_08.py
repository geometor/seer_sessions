"""
1. **Input Scanning:** The transformation starts by examining the input grid from the top-left corner.

2. **Columnar Focus:** It appears to process the input primarily column by column, starting from the leftmost column.

3. **Irregular Row Selection:** Within each of the first three columns, a seemingly arbitrary and irregular selection of rows is performed. This selection does *not* follow a consistent pattern (e.g., every third row) and differs between examples and even between columns within the same example. It is not a simple truncation or a fixed-interval sampling.

4. **Output Construction:** The selected pixels from each column are then arranged sequentially to form the output grid. The output width is consistently equal to the number of columns considered (3), and the output height is fixed at 5.

5. **No Simple Object Mapping:** There isn't a straightforward mapping of entire objects from input to output. The transformation seems to operate at the pixel level based on coordinates within the initial columns, rather than on object properties.

6. **Color Preservation (Mostly):**  The output pixels mostly use colors found in the input.
