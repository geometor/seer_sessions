Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, each with a color value from 0 to 9.  The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2). There's a distinct pattern of a red cross-like structure formed by the red (2) pixels. Within the arms of the red cross, there are blue (1) pixels. The transformation seems to involve altering the colors of some pixels, specifically some of the white background inside the cross.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - width: 17
      - height: 17
      - cells: pixels with color values 0-9

  - object: red_cross
    description: Cross-shaped structure
    properties:
      - color: red (2)
      - composition: contiguous red pixels
      - surrounds: blue and white pixels

  - object: blue_pixels
    description: Blue pixels inside arms of red cross
    properties:
        - color: blue(1)
        - location: within the red cross structure

  - object: background
    description: set of all white pixels
    properties:
        - color: white(0)

  - action: fill
    description: Change color of selected white pixels to red.
    parameters:
      - condition:  white pixels that form 3x3 squares with other white pixels and share an edge or corner with blue pixels inside the red cross.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Cross:** Locate the contiguous block of red (2) pixels forming the cross shape.

2.  **Identify Internal Blue Pixels:** Locate the blue (1) pixels within the arms of the red cross.

3.  **Locate White Regions inside the Cross:** Identify the regions of white (0) pixels adjacent to the red cross on the inside of the cross and adjacent to blue pixels.

4. **Conditional Fill:**
    Iterate over each white pixel inside the cross:
    - If the white pixel is the part of a 3x3 square of other white pixels (including diagonal) AND shares an edge or diagonal with at least one of the blue (1) pixels identified in Step 2, change color to red (2)

In essence, the transformation fills in specific white areas within the red cross structure with red, contingent upon their proximity to both other white pixels in a 3x3 grid, and existing blue pixels.
