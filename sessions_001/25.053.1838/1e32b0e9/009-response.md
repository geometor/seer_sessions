Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach correctly identified the core concept of filling in white areas within a cross-like shape based on adjacency to blue pixels. However, it's clear that the conditions for filling are too restrictive and don't generalize across all examples. Specifically, the `is_within_cross` function and the `has_3x3_square` condition are causing problems. The cross detection is not robust enough to find all crosses and the reliance on all surrounding pixels being the same is incorrect for cases 2 and 3. The "cross" seems to be more generally defined as a continuous block, or blob, of the fill color. Also in case 3, the fill color is blue, not red.

We need a more flexible way to define the "inner" region of the shape and a more accurate adjacency rule. We also must consider that the fill shape is not always red (case 3 is blue).

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Improve Shape Detection:** Instead of relying on a predefined "cross" shape, use a more general "blob detection" algorithm. This could involve finding connected components of a specific color. We should probably detect the color of the outside shape dynamically.

2.  **Rethink "Inside" Definition:** The `is_within_cross` function is based on a rectangular bounding box, which is inaccurate for irregular shapes. A better approach might be to use a flood fill algorithm or a concept of "enclosure" based on connectivity. A more flexible and general rule is needed.

3.  **Refine Adjacency Rule:** The current adjacency check (`is_adjacent` including 3x3 square) is too strict. A simple check for direct neighbors (up, down, left, right) might be sufficient, or potentially diagonal neighbors as well.

4.  **Dynamic fill color:** find the fill color dynamically rather than assume it is red.

**Example Metrics and Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, focusing on where the current logic fails:

*   **Example 1:** The primary issue is that the white pixels are only filled if they're part of a 3x3 white square *and* adjacent to blue.  The output misses filling in white areas that are adjacent to blue but don't have the full 3x3 white square. It also incorrectly assumes the cross is always centered, and defined by a min/max of the coordinates.

*   **Example 2:**  The same problem as Example 1, magnified. The `is_within_cross` function completely breaks down here because the "cross" isn't a simple rectangle, and the 3x3 rule fails to fill the spaces.

*   **Example 3:** This example highlights the need for a more robust shape and fill color detection. The color to be used for filling is blue (1), not red.

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
objects:
  - id: shape_1 # the object id is arbitrary
    color: variable # color of the main shape/blob. In example 1 this is red, example 3 it is blue
    description: The main shape, often cross-like but can be any contiguous block
    properties:
      contiguous: true # pixels of the shape are connected
  - id: shape_2
    color: variable # color of the filling/inside shape. In ex 1,2 this is blue. In 3 it is green.
    description: The shapes on the inside of shape_1
    properties:
     contiguous: true

  - id: fill_pixels # fill locations
    color: variable  # The color that fill_pixels will change to.  should be shape_1.color
    description: Pixels inside shape_1 that are adjacent to shape_2
    properties:
        adjacent_to: shape_2

actions:
  - type: color_change # change the color
    target: fill_pixels # target is a set of pixels, not a color or value
    new_color: shape_1.color # new color of the target pixels
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Main Shape:** Find the largest contiguous block of pixels of a single color (call this `shape_1` and its color `color_1`). The color should be determined dynamically.

2.  **Identify Inside Shapes:** Identify separate contiguous regions of a different color (call these `shape_2`, color is `color_2`) that exist and are adjacent to the color\_1 pixels.

3. **Identify Inside White Pixels:** Find the white (0) pixels that are inside or adjacent to `shape_1`.

4.  **Conditional Fill:** Iterate through the identified white pixels. If a white pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) to any pixel of `color_2`, change the white pixel's color to `color_1`.
