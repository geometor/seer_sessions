Okay, let's analyze this input-output example pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid Structure:** Both input and output are grids of the same dimensions (17x17).
*   **Colors:** The primary colors involved are white (0), blue (8), and red (2).
*   **Shapes:** There are horizontal and vertical lines of blue (8), and some isolated shapes of red (2).
*   **Changes:** The most noticeable change is the blue (8) color filling some regions boundaried by the blue color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: blue_lines
    type: lines
    color: blue (8)
    properties:
      - orientation: horizontal and vertical
      - forms: a cross shape

  - id: red_shapes
    type: shapes
    color: red (2)
    properties:
      - size: variable, small contiguous blocks
      - position: appears within the blue cross

  - id: filled_areas
    type: area
    color: blue(8)
    properties:
        - location: surrounded by original blue lines and extended parts of the lines

actions:
  - type: fill
    agent: blue_lines
    target: areas adjacent to and enclosed by pre-existing blue lines, as well as some extension to existing.
    properties:
      - expansion: extends to include one cell beyond the original boundary
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Existing Blue Lines:** Locate the horizontal and vertical blue (8) lines that form a cross shape in the input grid.
2.  **Extend Blue Lines:** Extend the blue lines by adding a blue pixel directly to the open ends of the existing blue segments. In other words, wherever a blue line has blank space on either side, it is extended, but if blue meets another blue pixel, then it isn't expanded on that side.
3.  **Fill Bounded Areas:** Fill the areas that are boundaried by original blue lines and extended parts of the lines (from Step 2) with blue color.

This program describes how the blue lines seem to act as boundaries, and how the filling operation respects those boundaries, and how those boundaries are extended.
