The primary colors involved appear to be white (0), blue (1), and red (2). There's a distinct pattern of a red cross-like structure formed by the red (2) pixels. Within the arms of the red cross, there are blue (1) pixels. The transformation seems to involve altering the colors of some pixels, specifically some of the white background inside the cross.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
