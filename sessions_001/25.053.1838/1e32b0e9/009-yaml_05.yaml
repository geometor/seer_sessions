objects:
  - id: shape_1 # the object id is arbitrary
    color: variable # color of the main shape/blob. In example 1 this is red, example 3 it is blue
    description: The main shape, often cross-like but can be any contiguous block
    properties:
      contiguous: true # pixels of the shape are connected
  - id: shape_2
    color: variable # color of the filling/inside shape. In ex 1,2 this is blue. In 3 it is green.
    description: The shapes on the inside of shape_1
    properties:
     contiguous: true

  - id: fill_pixels # fill locations
    color: variable  # The color that fill_pixels will change to.  should be shape_1.color
    description: Pixels inside shape_1 that are adjacent to shape_2
    properties:
        adjacent_to: shape_2

actions:
  - type: color_change # change the color
    target: fill_pixels # target is a set of pixels, not a color or value
    new_color: shape_1.color # new color of the target pixels
