            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of identifying, extending, and filling blue lines based on a cross shape was too specific to the first example. The subsequent examples reveal that the \"cross\" pattern isn't a universal rule. The flood fill is filling the whole grid and causing a major error. The extension of lines appears to not handle cases where the line would \"wrap\" around. Instead of a cross, it seems there's a simpler rule that needs to be generalized.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Re-examine the Core Transformation:** Instead of focusing on crosses, we need to identify the fundamental relationship between input and output. It appears the key operation is filling areas *adjacent* to existing lines with the same color, not just bounded areas. It is flood filling in all directions.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Extension Logic:** The line extension should probably be integrated to the fill logic.\n\n3.  **Revisit Flood Fill:** the current floodfill is not constrained. It must be constrained to the shape defined in the input.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example, focusing on object properties and actions. I'll use the term \"seed\" pixel for pixels of the same color in the input grid:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: Has a blue cross. Other colors (red) are present.\n    *   Expected Output: Blue extends from the cross, filling areas adjacent to the original blue pixels.\n    *   Actual Output: Completely filled with blue except for some original seed pixels\n    *   Key Observation: Filling is based on adjacency to existing blue, but fills the entire grid instead of specific regions.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: Has a red cross. Other colors (grey) are present.\n    *   Expected Output: Red extends from the cross.\n    *   Actual Output: The red lines are replaced with blue and the rest is filled incorrectly\n    *   Key Observation: Filling is color dependent, but uses wrong color.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: Has a blue cross. Other colors are present.\n    *   Expected output: Blue extends from cross.\n    *   Actual Output: the output is filled.\n    *   Key Observation: The input color is correct, and the behavior is very similar to Example 1.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - example_id: 1\n    seed_color: 8  # Blue\n    seed_objects:\n      - type: cross\n        description: Horizontal and vertical lines intersecting.\n    actions:\n      - type: fill\n        description: Fill areas adjacent to existing seed color pixels with seed color\n        constraint: adjacent_only\n  - example_id: 2\n    seed_color: 2  # red\n    seed_objects:\n       - type: cross\n         description: Horizontal and vertical lines intersecting.\n    actions:\n      - type: fill\n        description: Fill areas adjacent to existing seed color pixels with seed color.\n        constraint: adjacent_only\n  - example_id: 3\n    seed_color: 1  # Blue\n    seed_objects:\n      - type: cross\n        description: Horizontal and vertical intersecting lines.\n    actions:\n      - type: fill\n        description: Fill areas adjacent to existing seed color pixels with seed color.\n        constraint: adjacent_only\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Seed Color:** Determine the color of the initial lines or shapes in the input grid. We can call this color the \"seed color.\"\n2.  **Iterative Expansion:** For each pixel matching the seed color, change the adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right) to the seed color.\n3. **Repeat Expansion** Repeat the iterative expansion until the pixels stop changing.\n\nThe key is that we're *not* looking for specific shapes (like crosses). Instead, we're iteratively expanding outwards from *any* pixel of the seed color, changing only adjacent white (empty, color=0) pixels.\n"
