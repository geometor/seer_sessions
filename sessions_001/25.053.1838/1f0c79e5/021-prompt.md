Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule involves these steps:
1. Identify the Core: Locate the non-zero pixels (the "central cluster") within the input grid.
2. Mirror and Rotate: create a mirrored, rotated version of the non-zero pixels
3. replace: Change all the non-zero pixels in the original to '7'
4. Background: Retain the '0' pixels in the input grid where there were '0' originally
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Find non-zero pixels
    non_zero_pixels = []
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if input_grid[r, c] != 0:
                non_zero_pixels.append((r, c, input_grid[r,c]))

    # Apply transformation based on mirroring, rotating, and value changes
    for r, c, value in non_zero_pixels:
      output_grid[r,c] = 7
      output_grid[c,rows-1-r] = 7
      output_grid[cols-1-r,rows-1-c] = 7
      output_grid[cols-1-c,r] = 7

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
