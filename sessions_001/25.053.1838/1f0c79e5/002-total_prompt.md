**input:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains a small region of non-zero pixels (yellow and red) surrounded by zero-value pixels (white). The output grid seems to be derived from this region, but the transformation process isn't immediately obvious. The non-zero pixels in input are 2 and 4, in the output they all become 4. It appears the shape made from those pixels expand or "move".

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input grid contains a connected region of yellow (4) and red (2) pixels.
  - object: |
      The connected region of non-zero pixels.
  - property: shape |
     The initial shape defined by the position of 2 and 4.
  - property: color_map |
      red (2), yellow (4) and white/background (0).
  - action: |
      The shape expands to fill a square region of the same area.
  - transformation: |
      All non-zero pixels within the expanded region become yellow (4).
  - context: |
    input grid: 9x9
    output grid: 9x9
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Object:** Locate the connected region of non-zero pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Bounding shape:** identify the smallest rectangle that fits the object.
3. **Area Calculation**: calculate the area of that rectangle
4.  **Construct Transformed Shape:** Starting from the top-left corner, form the square with the closest area by expanding 1 unit in each direction (up, down, right, left)
5.  **Color Transformation:** All original colors of the object change to the most frequent color of the original object, in this case yellow (4).


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
