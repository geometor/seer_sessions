The transformation rule involves these steps:
1. Identify the Core: Locate the non-zero pixels (the "central cluster") within the input grid.
2. Mirror and Rotate: create a mirrored, rotated version of the non-zero pixels
3. replace: Change all the non-zero pixels in the original to '7'
4. Background: Retain the '0' pixels in the input grid where there were '0' originally

Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:

**General Assessment:**

The initial approach of mirroring and rotating the non-zero pixels around a perceived "center" and changing their color to '7' is fundamentally flawed. It doesn't capture the actual transformation logic, which is more about expanding the non-zero region and changing colors based on the original and the expanded shape, not a simple reflection. The results clearly show a mismatch in both pixel colors and positions across all examples. It seems the '7' might have accidentatlly aligned with one example, but the method is not general

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Discard the Mirror/Rotation Concept:** The current code's core idea is incorrect. We need to shift our focus from mirroring to understanding how the non-zero pixels *expand* to form the output.
2.  **Analyze Pixel Expansion:** Carefully examine how the non-zero pixels in the input relate to the non-zero pixels in the *expected* output. Look for patterns in how the shape grows, the direction of growth, and any color changes.
3.  **Re-evaluate Color Choices** The original non-zero pixels' colors are not preserved. Determine when, and how, pixel colors change.
4. **Accurate metrics** get an accurate count of pixels by color.

**Metrics and Observations (using a bit of manual analysis for now, but code execution would be ideal in a real environment):**

Here's a summary for each example:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: A small "L" shape of blue (4) and red (2) pixels.
    *   Expected Output: A larger, 3x3 block filled with the yellow (4)
    *   Issue: Code incorrectly mirrors and uses '7'.
    * metrics:
        * input colors: \[0: 77, 2: 1, 4: 2]
        * expected output colors: \[0: 72, 4: 9]
        * transformed output colors: \[0: 72, 7:9]

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: An "L" of green (3) and red(2).
    *   Expected Output: diagonal line of green (3).
    *   Issue: Code incorrectly mirrors and uses '7'.
    * metrics:
        * input colors: \[0: 77, 2: 1, 3: 2]
        * expected output colors: \[0: 72, 3: 9]
        * transformed output colors: \[0: 70, 7: 11]

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: A small cross of magenta (6) and red (2)
    *   Expected Output: A 3x3 block in the top right filled with magenta.
    *   Issue: Code doesn't handle position, and colors
    * metrics:
        * input colors: \[0: 77, 2: 2, 6: 2]
        * expected output colors: \[0: 72, 6: 9]
        * transformed output colors: \[0: 78, 7: 3]

*  **Example 4:**
    *   Input: Two red(2) and a grey(7).
    *   Expected Output: A more complex figure
    *   Issue: Code doesn't build the complex output.
    * metrics:
        * input colors: \[0: 77, 2: 2, 7: 1]
        * expected output colors: \[0: 63, 7: 18]
        * transformed output colors: \[0: 78, 7: 3]

**YAML Fact Block:**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "020d54a7"
  - input_objects:
      - description: "Non-zero colored pixels forming small, distinct shapes."
        properties:
          - colors: "Varied (blue, red, green, magenta, grey)"
          - shapes: "L-shapes, crosses, or individual pixels"
  - transformation_actions:
      - action: "Expansion"
        details: "Non-zero regions expand to form larger, regular shapes (often 3x3 squares)."
      - action: "Color Change"
        details: "All pixels of expanded shapes fill the whole shape with the mode value of the original pixels."
      - action: "Corner placement"
        details: "The expanded shapes frequently, but not exclusively, appear in corner positions."
      - action: "Background Preservation"
        details: "Original '0' (white) pixels remain unchanged where expansion does not happen."

```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Objects:** Locate all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These form the initial "seed" shapes.
2.  **Determine Target Shape and location:**
    *   For seed shapes of size greater than 1, expand to create a 3x3 filled rectangle
        using the color which most frequently exists in the seed shape.
    *   For shapes of a single pixel, the expansion rule is different
        * If the color is 2, create 3x3 shaped filled with color 7 in the top left.
        * Example 4 does not appear to follow the above rules.

3.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all '0' (white) pixels in the original input that are *not* part of the expanded shapes remain '0' in the output.

**Next steps**

A new coder phase is required. It appears there is a different between the
single pixel shapes and the multiple pixel shapes, and example 4 may be
different or an error. More examples might help clarify that last rule, but we
can proceed with an implementation attempt based on this assessment.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
