            "text": "Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and a plan to improve the transformation logic:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial approach of mirroring and rotating the non-zero pixels around a perceived \"center\" and changing their color to '7' is fundamentally flawed. It doesn't capture the actual transformation logic, which is more about expanding the non-zero region and changing colors based on the original and the expanded shape, not a simple reflection. The results clearly show a mismatch in both pixel colors and positions across all examples. It seems the '7' might have accidentatlly aligned with one example, but the method is not general\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Discard the Mirror/Rotation Concept:** The current code's core idea is incorrect. We need to shift our focus from mirroring to understanding how the non-zero pixels *expand* to form the output.\n2.  **Analyze Pixel Expansion:** Carefully examine how the non-zero pixels in the input relate to the non-zero pixels in the *expected* output. Look for patterns in how the shape grows, the direction of growth, and any color changes.\n3.  **Re-evaluate Color Choices** The original non-zero pixels' colors are not preserved. Determine when, and how, pixel colors change.\n4. **Accurate metrics** get an accurate count of pixels by color.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (using a bit of manual analysis for now, but code execution would be ideal in a real environment):**\n\nHere's a summary for each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: A small \"L\" shape of blue (4) and red (2) pixels.\n    *   Expected Output: A larger, 3x3 block filled with the yellow (4)\n    *   Issue: Code incorrectly mirrors and uses '7'.\n    * metrics:\n        * input colors: \\[0: 77, 2: 1, 4: 2]\n        * expected output colors: \\[0: 72, 4: 9]\n        * transformed output colors: \\[0: 72, 7:9]\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: An \"L\" of green (3) and red(2).\n    *   Expected Output: diagonal line of green (3).\n    *   Issue: Code incorrectly mirrors and uses '7'.\n    * metrics:\n        * input colors: \\[0: 77, 2: 1, 3: 2]\n        * expected output colors: \\[0: 72, 3: 9]\n        * transformed output colors: \\[0: 70, 7: 11]\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Input: A small cross of magenta (6) and red (2)\n    *   Expected Output: A 3x3 block in the top right filled with magenta.\n    *   Issue: Code doesn't handle position, and colors\n    * metrics:\n        * input colors: \\[0: 77, 2: 2, 6: 2]\n        * expected output colors: \\[0: 72, 6: 9]\n        * transformed output colors: \\[0: 78, 7: 3]\n\n*  **Example 4:**\n    *   Input: Two red(2) and a grey(7).\n    *   Expected Output: A more complex figure\n    *   Issue: Code doesn't build the complex output.\n    * metrics:\n        * input colors: \\[0: 77, 2: 2, 7: 1]\n        * expected output colors: \\[0: 63, 7: 18]\n        * transformed output colors: \\[0: 78, 7: 3]\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - task: \"020d54a7\"\n  - input_objects:\n      - description: \"Non-zero colored pixels forming small, distinct shapes.\"\n        properties:\n          - colors: \"Varied (blue, red, green, magenta, grey)\"\n          - shapes: \"L-shapes, crosses, or individual pixels\"\n  - transformation_actions:\n      - action: \"Expansion\"\n        details: \"Non-zero regions expand to form larger, regular shapes (often 3x3 squares).\"\n      - action: \"Color Change\"\n        details: \"All pixels of expanded shapes fill the whole shape with the mode value of the original pixels.\"\n      - action: \"Corner placement\"\n        details: \"The expanded shapes frequently, but not exclusively, appear in corner positions.\"\n      - action: \"Background Preservation\"\n        details: \"Original '0' (white) pixels remain unchanged where expansion does not happen.\"\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Input Objects:** Locate all non-zero pixels in the input grid. These form the initial \"seed\" shapes.\n2.  **Determine Target Shape and location:**\n    *   For seed shapes of size greater than 1, expand to create a 3x3 filled rectangle\n        using the color which most frequently exists in the seed shape.\n    *   For shapes of a single pixel, the expansion rule is different\n        * If the color is 2, create 3x3 shaped filled with color 7 in the top left.\n        * Example 4 does not appear to follow the above rules.\n\n3.  **Preserve Background:** Ensure all '0' (white) pixels in the original input that are *not* part of the expanded shapes remain '0' in the output.\n\n**Next steps**\n\nA new coder phase is required. It appears there is a different between the\nsingle pixel shapes and the multiple pixel shapes, and example 4 may be\ndifferent or an error. More examples might help clarify that last rule, but we\ncan proceed with an implementation attempt based on this assessment.\n"
