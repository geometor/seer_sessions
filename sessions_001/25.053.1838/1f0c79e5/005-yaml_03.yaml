  - task_id: '004'
  - objects:
    - description: "Input object is a contiguous region of non-zero pixels."
      properties:
        - "Variable size and shape."
        - "Consists of colors within the defined color map."
        - "Top-left pixel color is significant."
    - description: "Output is a spiral pattern."
      properties:
        - "Starts from the top-left corner."
        - "Follows a clockwise direction."
        - "Output dimensions related to number of pixels in input object."
        - "Involves repetition and transformation of the input object, or parts of it."
        - "The primary color seems to follow the position in the input object - the 'inner' color becomes dominant."
  - transformations:
      - "The input object, is transformed by some combination of mirroring/rotation, or potentially taking just one row/column and using that."
      - "Output size is related to the number of pixels in the input object."
      - "The final pattern consists of only one color (besides the background) present in the original object, plus the background (color 0)."
      - "The transformed object is used to fill the output grid in a clockwise spiral pattern, potentially by repeating rows or columns of the input."
