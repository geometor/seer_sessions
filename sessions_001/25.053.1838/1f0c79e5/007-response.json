The input grid contains a small number of non-zero pixels (colored green and red in the visual representation). The output grid appears to be an expansion or \"filling in\" of the non-zero pixels from the input, primarily using the green color (value 3). The red pixel (value 2) in the input seems to be replaced or overwritten by the green. The expansion follows a pattern, moving downwards and to the right.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Consider these as starting points for \"green objects.\" Also note the red pixel.\n2.  **Expansion:** For each green object, expand it downwards and to the right. This means changing the color of adjacent pixels to 3 (green), starting from the initial green pixel.\n3.  **Overwrite:** If a pixel with the value of 2 (red) found. It will be also became to 3 (green)\n4.  **Boundaries:** Continue the downward-right expansion until the edges of the 9x9 grid are reached. Do not expand beyond the grid boundaries. The expansion fills a rectangular area whose top-left corner is the initial green pixel.\n\nIn essence, the transformation rule takes the green pixels in the input and uses them as seeds to \"grow\" rectangular regions of green, filling the grid downwards and to the right, and replacing any single red object.\n"
