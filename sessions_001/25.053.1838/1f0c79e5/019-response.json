The input grid contains a small cluster of non-zero pixels (red '2' and orange '7') in the center, surrounded by a background of white ('0') pixels. The output grid seems to have a larger, more complex pattern of orange ('7') pixels, with the white ('0') background retained in some areas. The shape and location of the original non-zero pixels seem to influence the final pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
