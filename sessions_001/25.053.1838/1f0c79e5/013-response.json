The output grid seems to be a mirrored and rotated version of this square, but expanded and using only the magenta (6) color. The transformation inverts the 2x2 block, placing the '6' values on the opposite, and expands outwards, it also rotates the output so it fills the corner.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
