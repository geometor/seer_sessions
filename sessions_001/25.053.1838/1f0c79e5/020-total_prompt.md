Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by integers 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The input grid contains a small cluster of non-zero pixels (red '2' and orange '7') in the center, surrounded by a background of white ('0') pixels. The output grid seems to have a larger, more complex pattern of orange ('7') pixels, with the white ('0') background retained in some areas. The shape and location of the original non-zero pixels seem to influence the final pattern.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    size: 9x9
    description: Contains a central cluster of non-zero pixels.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements: integers (0-9)
    size: 9x9
    description: Contains a pattern of orange pixels ('7') and white pixels ('0').
  - object: central_cluster
    type: object
    location: input_grid
    colors: [2, 7] # red, orange
    description: The non-zero pixels in the input grid.
  - action: transformation
    type: grid_to_grid
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Transforms the input grid into the output grid based on a rule.
  - relationship: spatial_influence
    description: The position and values of the central_cluster in the input_grid likely determine the pattern in the output_grid.
  - pattern: output pattern is a mirrored, rotated version of the input pixels
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the non-zero pixels (the "central cluster") within the input grid.
2.  **Mirror and Rotate:** create a mirrored, rotated version of the non-zero pixels
3.  **replace**: Change all the non-zero pixels in the original to '7'
4.   **Background:** Retain the '0' pixels in the input grid where there were '0' originally

In essence, the transformation involves taking the non-zero section of the input, performing a transformation and changing values to 7.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
