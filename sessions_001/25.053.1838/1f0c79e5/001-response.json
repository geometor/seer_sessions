The input grid contains a small region of non-zero pixels (yellow and red) surrounded by zero-value pixels (white). The output grid seems to be derived from this region, but the transformation process isn't immediately obvious. The non-zero pixels in input are 2 and 4, in the output they all become 4. It appears the shape made from those pixels expand or \"move\".\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
