Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Input Object:** Find the connected region of non-zero pixels in the input grid. This forms the "input object."
2.  **Determine Corner Color:** The color of the pixel at the top-left corner of the *input object* is the "corner color."
3.  **Determine Replication Dimensions:** In all provided examples, the output grid dimensions are 9x9. (This needs further investigation, this could be a constant, or derived.). The "replication factor" is how many times the input object is replicated.
4.  **Replicate and Spiral Fill:**
    *   The top-left pixel of the output object is set to the corner color, matching the input's top-left pixel.
    *   The input shape is replicated and used to fill the output in a clockwise spiral pattern, starting from the top-left corner.  Each step of the spiral involves:
        *   Copying the *entire* input object.
        *   Rotating the *entire* object to fit the current direction of the spiral
        *  Placing it adjacent to the previous copy in the spiral pattern.
5. **Output Size:** The final size of the output grid is a square. In these examples, it is 9x9, but the rule for deriving this isn't clear yet.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
