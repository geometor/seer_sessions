            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial strategy of finding a bounding box, cropping, and rotating works for the first example but fails for the subsequent ones. The errors indicate two main issues:\n\n1.  **Missing Color:** The code doesn't handle cases where the target color (red, represented by '2') is absent in the input grid, which happens in Examples 2 and 3 (blue object - 1 and azure object - 8). This leads to `None` values being returned by `get_bounding_box`, causing errors during the cropping stage.\n2.  **Incorrect Object Selection:** The code assumes the target object is always red. This assumption is wrong, as seen in the other examples. We need a more general way to identify the object to be cropped and rotated.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Handle Missing Colors:** Modify `get_bounding_box` to return a default value (e.g., empty grid or specific coordinates) when the target color isn't found. This will prevent errors.\n2. **Dynamic Object Detection:** Select an object that can vary in color by iterating the colors, skipping black (0).\n3.  **Rotation:** The rotation needs to be clockwise by 90 degree.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nHere's a breakdown of each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a red object.\n    *   **Expected Output:** Rotated red object.\n    *   **Transformed Output:** Incorrect rotation and position.\n    *   **Issues:** The transformed image is not correct (pixels are not in the correct positions)\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a blue object (color 1).\n    *   **Expected Output:** Rotated blue object.\n    *  **Error:** runtime - cannot perform the rotation if the color to find\n       the bounding box is provided\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains an azure object (color 8).\n    *   **Expected Output:** Rotated azure object.\n    *  **Error:** runtime - cannot perform the rotation if the color to find\n       the bounding box is provided\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    object_color: red  # Initial assumption, needs to be generalized\n    action: rotate_clockwise_90\n    object_shape: irregular\n    object_selection: bounding_box\n  - id: 2\n    object_color: blue\n    action: rotate_clockwise_90\n    object_shape: irregular\n    object_selection: bounding_box\n  - id: 3\n    object_color: azure\n    action: rotate_clockwise_90\n    object_shape: irregular\n    object_selection: bounding_box\n\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify Target Object:** Find a non-black object within the input grid. Determine its color.\n2.  **Bounding Box:** Define a bounding box around the identified object.\n3.  **Crop:** Extract the section of the grid defined by the bounding box.\n4.  **Rotate:** Rotate the cropped section clockwise by 90 degrees.\n5.  **Output:** Return the rotated section.\n"
