Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a large grid (12x10) filled mostly with white pixels (0) and a small "L" shaped object made of red pixels (2).
*   The output is a smaller grid (4x4) that seems to be a condensed representation of the input, focusing on the red pixels. The arrangement of the red pixels in the output matches part of red area in the input.
* The output isolates and rotates a part of input.

**YAML Fact Block:**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 12x10
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        dominant: true
      - color: red
        value: 2
        dominant: false
        shape: L

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 4x4
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
        dominant: false
      - color: red
        value: 2
        dominant: true
        shape: L_rotated
  - observation: The output grid contains a cropped and rotated section of input grid.
  - observation: The red pixels are the main content.
  - action: Extract object
  - action: rotate
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Find the bounding box of the red colored object within the input grid.
2.  **Crop:** Extract this bounding box, from input.
3. **Rotate:** rotate cropped part clockwise by 90 degrees.
4.  **Output:** Present the rotated and cropped section.
