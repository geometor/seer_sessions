Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate contiguous regions of pixels of the same color. Consider each of these regions as a separate "shape."

2.  **Process Azure Shapes:** For each shape composed of azure (8) pixels:
    *   Shift all pixels of the shape to be as close as possible to the left boundary of the input grid.
    *   Preserve the relative positions (vertical stacking) of the pixels of the shape.

3.  **Preserve other Shapes:** Shapes that are not azure (8) remain unchanged in their original positions.

4.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with the modified azure shapes and the preserved other shapes.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
