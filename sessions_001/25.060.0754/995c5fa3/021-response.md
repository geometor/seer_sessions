Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a grid of numbers, primarily 5 (gray) with some 0s (white). The output is a smaller grid containing 2s (red) and 4s (yellow). The output grid seems to be related to a compressed or abstracted representation of the input grid. The spatial arrangement in the output is different and doesn't appear to be a straightforward sub-section of the input. There's likely a process involving identifying shapes, their features, and then mapping it all using new dimensions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid is 4x14, filled mostly with the color gray (5).
  - observation: There are white (0) pixels forming a distinct vertical shape in the input.
  - observation: Output grid is 3x3.
  - observation: The output grid is made of two colours.
  - observation: Top and bottom rows of the output are red (2) pixels.
  - observation: The middle row of the output contains three yellow (4).
  - object: vertical_shape
    properties:
      color: white (0)
      location: Starts approximately in the middle of the x axis of the input grid, surrounded by grey (5).
      dimensions: appears to span multiple rows, but the width changes.
  - object: red_rows
    properties:
        color: red (2)
        location: top and bottom rows.
        count: 2
  - object: yellow_row
      properties:
          color: yellow (4)
          location: middle row

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the "core" shape:** Find the contiguous region of white (0) pixels within the input grid. Think of this as the "significant feature" in the input.
2. **Analyze Input:** Count the number of distinct gray (5) columns to the left of the white (0) region, count the number of distinct gray(5) columns to the right.
3.  **Construct Output Dimensions:** The output grid will be 3x3.
4. **Populate the output grid**:
    *   Make rows 1 and 3 all red (2).
    *   Make row 2 all yellow (4).

Essentially, the transformation simplifies the input into a fixed-size output, discarding much of the original detail. The colours in the output have no relationship to the colours on the input, and only two colors will be in the result.
