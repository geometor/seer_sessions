The outputs are smaller 3x3 grids with various colors. The key seems to be the arrangement of the white (0) pixels within the larger input grid, as the grey (5) pixels seem to act as a background or frame. The output grid's colors are consistent in each example: a 3x3 of the same color\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Then, the third row has one white pixel at position (3,3). the output color is green (3)\n    - If the white pixels appear only on the second column, one in the first row and another on the second row, the output is yellow.\n    - if there are two white pixels in the second column and they are adjacent, in the first and second row, and only one white pixel is in the third row, the output color is yellow(4).\n3.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 3x3 output grid.\n4.  **Fill Output Grid:** Fill all cells of the output grid with the determined color.\n"
