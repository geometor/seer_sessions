Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Initialize:** Create a 3x3 output grid filled with white (0).

2.  **Iterate:** For each row in the input grid, get the row index (starting from 0).

3.  **Row Mapping:** Find the corresponding row in the output grid using the input row index.

4.  **All White:** If *all* pixels in the current input row are white (0), fill the corresponding output row with red (2).

5.  **All Non-White:** If *all* pixels in the current input row are non-white, fill the corresponding output row with white (0).

6.  **Mixed Pixels:** If the input row contains a *mixture* of white and non-white pixels, and if the row index is 0, then fill output with magenta (6). If the input row index is 1, then fill output with blue (1).

7.  **Output:** Return the 3x3 output grid.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
