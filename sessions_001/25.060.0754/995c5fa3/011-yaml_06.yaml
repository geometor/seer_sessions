observations:
  - task: Divide input grid into nine sections and map the number of white pixels to a specific color.
  - input_object:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: variable
        - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
  - output_object:
      type: grid
      properties:
        - dimensions: 3x3
        - values: integers (representing colors based on a mapping)
  - sections:
      count: 9
      properties:
        - arrangement: 3x3 grid
        - size: "input width / 3, input height/3"
  - color_mapping:
     properties:
       - 1:4
       - 2:2
       - 3:3
  - actions:
    - Divide: "The input is divided into nine equal sections."
    - Map: "Each section in output is colored according to presence of 0."
