Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Ignore the input grid entirely.**
2.  **Create a 3x3 output grid.**
3.  **Fill the top row (row 0) with red (value 2).**
4.  **Fill the middle row (row 1) with yellow (value 4).**
5.  **Fill the bottom row (row 2) with red (value 2).**
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize a 3x3 output grid with all zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Fill the top row (row 0) with red (value 2).
    output_grid[0, :] = 2

    # Fill the middle row (row 1) with yellow (value 4).
    output_grid[1, :] = 4

    # Fill the bottom row (row 2) with red (value 2).
    output_grid[2, :] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results and update the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial program was overly simplistic, assuming a constant 3x3 output grid with a fixed color pattern (red, yellow, red). The test results on the training examples show this is incorrect, as the output grid size varies, and the color pattern is not consistent. The core issue is that the initial program completely disregarded the input grid. The updated strategy needs to consider the input, at least in terms of the dimensions, or there may be relationships or patterns between input and output to incorporate.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To better understand the transformations, I'll use a simplified representation of the grids, focusing on dimensions and notable color values.

Here's a summary of the training examples and the results based on the previous code:

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: 1x1, value: 0
    *   Expected Output: 3x3, values: [[2, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2]]
    *   Actual Output: 3x3, values: [[2, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2]]
    *   Correct: Yes

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: 3x3, values: [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]
    *   Expected Output: 5x5, values: [[2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]
    *   Actual Output: 3x3, values: [[2, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2]]
    *   Correct: No

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input: 5x5, values: [[0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]]
    *   Expected Output: 9x9, values: [[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]
    *   Actual Output: 3x3, values: [[2, 2, 2], [4, 4, 4], [2, 2, 2]]
    *   Correct: No

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input:
    dimensions: [1, 1]
    colors: [white]
  output:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    colors: [red, yellow]
    pattern: "red, yellow, red rows"
  result:
    correct: True

example_2:
  input:
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    colors: [white, blue]
  output:
    dimensions: [5, 5]
    colors: [red, yellow]
    pattern: "red, yellow, yellow, yellow, red rows"
  result:
    correct: False

example_3:
  input:
    dimensions: [5, 5]
    colors: [white, blue]
  output:
    dimensions: [9, 9]
    colors: [red, yellow]
    pattern: "red, yellow x7, red rows"
  result:
    correct: False
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:** The output grid's dimensions are based on the input grid's dimensions. The output dimensions are calculated as `2 * input_dimension + 1`.

2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create an output grid of the size calculated.

3.  **Fill the top row with red (color 2).**

4. **Fill all rows except the top and bottom rows with yellow (color 4).**

5.  **Fill the bottom row with red (color 2).**

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
