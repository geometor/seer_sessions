facts:
  - observation: "The input grid is divided into nine equal sections."
  - observation: "The output is always a 3x3 grid."
  - observation: "Sections are numbered 1 to 9, from top-left to bottom-right."
  - property: output_mapping
    details: "A mapping that determines the output color for each section."
  - rule: "Sections 1, 2, and 3 initially map to 4 (yellow)."
  - rule: "Sections 4, 5, and 6 always map to 4 (yellow)."
  - rule: "Sections 7, 8 initially map to 3 (green), and 9 initially maps to 3(green)."
  - condition: "If any non-zero pixel exists in sections 7 or 8, their output changes to 2 (red)."
  - condition: "If any non-zero pixel exists in section 1, section 1's output value is 3(green)"
  - condition: "Section 9 always map to 3 (green)."
