**Perception of Elements:**

The inputs are grids of varying dimensions, primarily composed of grey (5) and white (0) pixels.  The outputs are smaller 3x3 grids with various colors. The key seems to be the arrangement of the white (0) pixels within the larger input grid, as the grey (5) pixels seem to act as a background or frame. The output grid's colors are consistent in each example: a 3x3 of the same color

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [grey, white]
      dimensions: variable
  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      colors: [red, green, blue, yellow, azure]
      dimensions: 3x3
  - name: white_pixel_pattern
    type: pattern
    properties:
      arrangement: variable # Describes the relative positions of white pixels

actions:
  - name: map_pattern_to_color
    input: white_pixel_pattern
    output: color
    description: Determines the output color based on the white pixel pattern in the input grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains white_pixel_pattern
  - white_pixel_pattern determines output_grid color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify White Pixel Pattern:** Examine the input grid and focus on the arrangement of white (0) pixels. Ignore the grey (5) pixels.
2.  **Determine Color Based on Pattern:**
    - if there are two white pixels in the second column and they are adjacent, in the first and second row, and two more adjacent white pixels on the third and fourth row, the color is azure (8).
    - If the white blocks are shaped like an "L" then the output color is red (2)
    - If there are white pixels only in the second column, and are at positions (1,2) and (3,2). Then, the third row has one white pixel at position (3,3). the output color is green (3)
    - If the white pixels appear only on the second column, one in the first row and another on the second row, the output is yellow.
    - if there are two white pixels in the second column and they are adjacent, in the first and second row, and only one white pixel is in the third row, the output color is yellow(4).
3.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 3x3 output grid.
4.  **Fill Output Grid:** Fill all cells of the output grid with the determined color.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
