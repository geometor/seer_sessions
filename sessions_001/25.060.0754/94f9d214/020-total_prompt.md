Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies all green pixels in the input grid and changes their color to red. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input, and all other pixels remain white. The green pixels are replaced in place.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Create a copy of the input grid to serve as the output grid.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through all pixels in the input grid.
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check if the pixel is green.
            if input_grid[i, j] == 3:
                # Change the pixel color to red.
                output_grid[i, j] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were too specific. The original description assumed *all* non-green pixels should be white, which is incorrect based on the additional training examples. It also assumed that only green pixels are transformed. The core concept of identifying and modifying certain colored pixels is valid, but the precise conditions and actions need adjustment. We need to generalize the rule to accurately reflect *all* provided examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine the `input_grid` and `output_grid` for each training example, comparing them to the `predicted_grid` generated by the current code. Identify where the code's prediction matches the expected output and where it deviates.
2.  **Identify Correct Rule:** Determine the *actual* rule governing the transformation by observing common patterns across all examples.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program description to accurately reflect the observed transformation rule, not just the initial hypothesis.
4.  **Metrics:** Create small python programs using a `code_execution` block to automate analyzing properties of the input and output, to use in constructing observation YAML.
5. **Observation YAML:** Use a YAML block to record key data, relationships, and rules.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Let's use `code_execution` to gather information from all examples to identify the relationship between the input and output grids more precisely.

# Example data (replace with actual data from the task)
train_examples = [
    {
        "input": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),
        "output": np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]),

for example_index, example in enumerate(train_examples):
    input_grid = example['input']
    output_grid = example['output']
    print(f"Example {example_index + 1}:")
    print(f"  Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f"  Output shape: {output_grid.shape}")

    # Find unique colors in input and output

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
