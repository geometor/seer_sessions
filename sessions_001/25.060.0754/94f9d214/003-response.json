The input grid seems to have a greater variety of colors and is larger, while the output grid is smaller, uses fewer colors and a different shape. The output grid seems to focus on specific areas of the original. The predominant colors in the input are white (0), blue (1), and green (3), while the output contains only white(0), and red (2).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The 4th column elements of the input corresponds to the 4th column of the output, where green (3) becomes red (2).\n\nEssentially, the transformation takes the top 3x3 input area, replaces the 3 by 2 and keeps the 0. The 4th column of the top 3 rows of the input becomes the 4th column of the output.\n\n"
