**input:**
```

**output:**
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid contains multiple colors (represented by integers 0, 1, and 3), while the output grid seems to be a simplified, smaller version containing only colors 0 and 2. The output grid's dimensions are smaller than the input. There seems to be a relationship between the location of color 3 (green) in the input and color 2(red) in the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input_grid:
      dimensions: [8, 4]
      colors: [0, 1, 3]
      objects:
        - color: 3 # Green
          positions: [[0,1], [0,2], [1,1], [1,3], [2,2], [3,0], [3,1], [3,2], [3,3]]
        - color: 1 # Blue
          positions:  [[4,0], [4,1], [4,2], [4,3], [5,0], [5,1], [6,0], [6,1], [7,1], [7,2]]
        - color: 0 # White
          positions: [[0,0], [0,3], [1,0], [1,2], [2,0], [2,1], [2,3],[5,2], [5,3], [6,2], [6,3], [7,0], [7,3]]

  - output_grid:
      dimensions: [4, 4]
      colors: [0, 2]
      objects:
          - color: 2 # Red
            positions: [[1,2], [2,3]]
          - color: 0 # White
            positions: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,0], [1,1], [1,3], [2,0], [2,1], [2,2], [3,0], [3,1], [3,2], [3,3]]

  - relationships:
      - type: "size reduction"
        from: input_grid
        to: output_grid
      - type: "color mapping"
        mapping:
            3: 2 # Green to Red
            0: 0 # White to White
            1: 0 # Blue to White

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide** the input grid into 2x1 blocks, starting from the top-left corner. Consider pairs of vertically adjacent cells.
2.  **Iterate** through these 2x1 blocks.
3.  **Map** each block to a single cell in the output grid using the following rules:
    *   If a 2x1 block contains the color 3 (green) in either of the cells , the corresponding output cell is color 2 (red).
    *   Otherwise, the corresponding output cell is color 0 (white).
4. The output is a 4 x 4 grid.

In short, if a vertical pair of pixels in the input grid contains *any* green, the mapped pixel in the output grid becomes red. Everything else is white in output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
