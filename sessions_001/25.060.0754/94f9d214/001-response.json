The input grids appear to have varying sizes and contain regions of green (3) and blue (1) pixels, in addition to white (0) pixels. The output grids are consistently smaller (4x4) and mostly white, with some red (2) pixels. The key seems to be a relationship between the green pixels in the input and the red pixels in the output.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

A bounding box is defined here as a minimal rectangle aligned to grid axes that encloses the component.\n\n3. **Translate and Scale:** Each green pixel is translated to one red pixel in output grid.\n    - Take the set of the coordinates of the top left corner of the minimal rectangle bounding the green regions,\n    - Find the lowest x and y coordinates, consider this the top left corner of the red area.\n    - Do the same with bottom right corners of green rectangles. Consider this bottom right corner of the red area.\n\n4. **Output Grid Creation:** Create an output grid with dimensions 4x4. Fill it entirely with white (0) pixels.\n\n5. **Fill Red Pixels:** Within the output grid, place the red pixels according to the bounding boxes, computed in step 3.\n\nIn essence, the transformation identifies green regions, finds their minimal enclosing rectangle using top-left and bottom-right corners, and maps them to red regions inside the output grid.\n"
