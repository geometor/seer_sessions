Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. The input grid contains pixels of values 0, 1, and 3 (white, blue, and green). The output grid contains pixels of values 0 and 2 (white and red). The output grid appears to be a simplified, smaller version of the input grid, focusing on specific features.  The dimensions of input and output are different. Input grid is 8x4, and output is 4x4.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains colors white, blue, and green.
  - observation: Output grid contains colors white and red.
  - observation: Output grid is smaller than the input grid.
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 8x4
      colors: [0, 1, 3]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 4x4
      colors: [0, 2]
  - relationship: Output grid seems to represent a transformation of the input grid.
  - action: The transformation process might involve identifying specific shapes or patterns and placing new color in a new coordinate system
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Shapes:** Examine the input grid and identify two distinct 2x2 squares, one of all the same color (but it could be different color) and one of mixed.
2. **Top Left**: Starting at the top left of the input, observe first 2x2 square composed of green (3). Transform corresponding pixel in the output grid by assigning color red (2) in top left.
3.  **Bottom Right**: Next, observe, in the bottom right, a 2x2 square of blue (1). Transform corresponding pixel in the output grid by assigning color red (2) in top left.
4. **Consolidate and Place**: The output grid appears to be one quadrant of the input grid and represent it.
5. **Fill**: Any area not matching the shape transformation is filled with white color (0)

In summary, the transformation identifies certain color squares (based on color and position) in the input grid and maps the information as color red in the output grid, compacting to top left. Everything else become white.
