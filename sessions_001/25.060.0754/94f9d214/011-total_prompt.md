Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation identifies 2x2 squares of the same color in the input grid.
If a 2x2 square of the same color is found, the corresponding cell in the output grid is colored red (2).
All other cells in the output grid are white (0). The output grid is 1/4 the size of the input grid.
Specifically, it takes color from the top-left corner of 2x2 in input and puts to top left corner of output, for example:

Input Grid:
3 3 3 3     2x2 of 3s
0 3 3 0
0 0 3 3
3 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1     2x2 of 1s
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1

Output Grid:
0 0 0 0
2 0 0 0  <- Top-left of the 2x2 of 3s is red
2 0 0 0  <- Top-left of the 2x2 of 1s is red
0 2 2 0

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
