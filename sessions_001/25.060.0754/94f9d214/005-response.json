            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against all the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were focused on a very specific transformation within the top-left 3x3 region and the 4th column. While this worked for the first example, it failed to generalize to the other training examples. The core issue is that the initial program was *too specific* and didn't capture the underlying, more general rule. We need to shift from describing specific pixel manipulations to identifying the broader pattern of object replacement and color mapping. It assumed the transformation related to the 4th column when there is only a transformation of the 3x3 area in the top left.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes an \"object\" in this context. It seems to be contiguous regions of the same color.\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Determine the general rule for color changes (e.g., green becomes red, not just in the 3x3 area, but potentially everywhere).\n3.  **Spatial Transformation:** Figure out if there's a consistent spatial rule (e.g., only the top-left 3x3 region is affected, or is the transformation applied more broadly?).\n4.  **Discard Assumptions**: remove assumption that the 4th column of the top 3 rows is a part of the transformation.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo accurately assess, let's categorize each example and its result:\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct) - The initial code correctly transformed the first example.\n*   **Example 2:** (Incorrect) - The code doesn't handle input that's not 3x4 and only processes part of the example data. The color map needs to applied to the full grid and the output grid should be the same size as the input grid.\n*  **Example 3:** (Incorrect) - Similar to example 2.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - example_1:\n      input_shape: [4, 4]\n      output_shape: [4, 4]\n      objects:\n        - color: green\n          shape: region\n          position: top-left\n        - color: black\n          shape: region\n          position: varies\n      transformation:\n        color_map:\n          green: red\n          black: black\n        spatial: top-left 3x3 region, then copied to output\n  - example_2:\n      input_shape: [5, 6]\n      output_shape: [5, 6]\n      objects:\n         - color: green\n           shape: region\n           position: top-left\n         - color: black\n           shape: region\n           position: varies\n      transformation:\n        color_map:\n          green: red\n          black: black\n        spatial: top-left 3x3 region, then copied to output, full output same size as input\n  - example_3:\n      input_shape: [6, 6]\n      output_shape: [6, 6]\n      objects:\n         - color: green\n           shape: region\n           position: top-left\n         - color: black\n           shape: region\n           position: varies\n      transformation:\n        color_map:\n          green: red\n          black: black\n        spatial: top-left 3x3 region, then copied to output, full output same size as input\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** Create an output grid that is the same dimensions as the input grid, initially filled with zeros or a copy of the input grid.\n2.  **Object Identification**: In the top-left 3x3 region of the *input* grid, identify contiguous regions of pixels (objects).\n3.  **Color Transformation**: Within the identified 3x3 region of the *output* grid:\n    *   If a pixel in the input is green (3), change the corresponding output pixel to red (2).\n    *   If a pixel in the input is black (0), keep the corresponding output pixel as black (0).\n4. **Copy**: The rest of the input grid outside of the 3x3 region should be copied to the output grid.\n\nRevised Natural Language Program (more concise):\n\n\"The output grid is the same size as the input grid. Within the top-left 3x3 region of the input, green pixels are replaced with red pixels in the output, and black pixels remain black. All other input pixels are copied to the output grid without change.\"\n"
