Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, structured as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors represented by digits (0-9), while the output grid seems to have a reduced size and a more limited set of colors (primarily 0 and 3, which correspond to white and green). The input grid appears to be divided into distinct sections or blocks of colors. The output seems to select some representation of these.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - name: input_grid
        dimensions: 9x4
        elements: [0, 1, 2, 4] # Colors present in the input
      - name: output_grid
        dimensions: 4x4
        elements: [0, 3] # Colors present in the output

actions:
  - name: reduce_grid
    description: The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid.
  - name: select_color
    description: A representative color is chosen from sections of the input grid and placed in the output grid.

relationships:
  - input_grid_sections: The input grid can be conceptually divided into 2x2 blocks of cells.
  - output_grid_cells: Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a 2x2 block in the input.
  - color_representation:  If a 2x2 section of the Input Grid contains color `1` the corresponding location in the output is color `3`. Otherwise the output is `0`.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Conceptually divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks of cells.
2.  **Iterate:** For each 2x2 block in the input grid:
3.  **Check for Blue:** Inspect each of the cells for the presence of the color blue (1).
4. **Transform:**
    *   If blue (1) is present in the block, set the output to be green (3)
    *   If blue (1) is *not* present in the 2x2 block, make that output cell white (0).
5.  **Output Placement:** Place the resulting color (0 or 3) in the corresponding cell of the output grid. The output grid's dimensions will be derived from the number of 2x2 blocks in each dimension of the input grid.

In summary, the transformation identifies the presence of the number `1` (blue) in each 2x2 area, and if exists, the program changes it to 3 (green). If 1 doesn't not exists, it puts 0 in the output grid cell.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
