Previous Code:
```python
"""
Conceptually divide the input grid into non-overlapping 2x2 blocks. For each block:

1.  Check the pattern.
2.  If the pattern is blue on the top left, bottom right, and top right, output the color in the bottom left of the square.
3. If blue is only in a single cell, output is green
4. Else, Output White.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on a hypothesis derived from the first training example, focusing on 2x2 blocks and specific blue pixel patterns. While it correctly handled the first example, the subsequent examples reveal flaws in this initial hypothesis. The core issue is that the initial program is too rigid, looking for *very* specific patterns within 2x2 blocks and not generalizing well. The results demonstrate a need for these revisions:

1.  **Re-evaluate Block Size:** The 2x2 block assumption may not be universally applicable. We need to consider if the transformation operates on individual pixels, larger blocks, or even the entire grid as a whole. The second and third examples suggest a relationship goes across the whole image.
2.  **Generalize the Pattern:** Instead of fixed patterns, we need to identify more general rules based on the *relationships* between pixels, potentially involving color counts, relative positions, or other geometric properties.
3.  **Consider Colors Beyond Blue:** While the initial program heavily focuses on blue, other colors might play crucial roles in the transformation. We need to analyze the roles of all colors.

**Metrics and Observations**

To get better insight, I'll derive some metrics from the input/output pairs.  Here are some things that appear to be important to track:

*   **Input Grid Dimensions:** rows x cols
*   **Output Grid Dimensions:** rows x cols
*   **Pixel Counts (Input):** Count of each color in the input.
*   **Pixel Counts (Output):** Count of each color in the output.
*   **Dominant Colors:** Determine the most frequent color(s) in both input and output.

Let's generate this data for the three training examples:

```tool_code
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid):
    grid = np.array(grid)
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    unique, counts = np.unique(grid, return_counts=True)
    pixel_counts = dict(zip(unique, counts))
    dominant_color = unique[np.argmax(counts)] if counts.size > 0 else None
    return {
        'rows': rows,
        'cols': cols,
        'pixel_counts': pixel_counts,
        'dominant_color': dominant_color
    }

examples = [
    {
        "input": [[1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8], [1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [1, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9], [0, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9]],
        "output": [[0, 8, 8], [1, 9, 9]]
    },
    {
        "input": [[1, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]],
        "output": [[3, 7, 7, 7, 7], [3, 7, 7, 7, 7], [3, 7, 7, 7, 7], [3, 7, 7, 7, 7]]
    },
    {
       "input": [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]],
       "output": [[6, 6, 6, 6, 3], [6, 6, 6, 6, 3], [6, 6, 6, 6, 3], [6, 6, 6, 6, 3], [6, 6, 6, 6, 3]]
    },
]

analysis_results = []
for example in examples:
    input_analysis = analyze_grid(example['input'])
    output_analysis = analyze_grid(example['output'])
    analysis_results.append({
        'input': input_analysis,
        'output': output_analysis
    })

for i, result in enumerate(analysis_results):
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Input:  Rows={result['input']['rows']}, Cols={result['input']['cols']}, Pixel Counts={result['input']['pixel_counts']}, Dominant Color={result['input']['dominant_color']}")
    print(f"  Output: Rows={result['output']['rows']}, Cols={result['output']['cols']}, Pixel Counts={result['output']['pixel_counts']}, Dominant Color={result['output']['dominant_color']}")

```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
