The output is a significantly smaller grid, seemingly derived from the input, containing only white (0) and green (3) pixels. The input grid appears to be divided into 2x2 blocks of pixels and contains distinct horizontal bands of colors. The output grid seems to consolidate some of these blocks based on color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The output grid will have dimensions equal to the block counts, i.e. output\\_height = input\\_height / block\\_height; output\\_width = input\\_width / block\\_width.\n\nEssentially, the transformation rule is a conditional consolidation: presence of yellow dictates a green output, absence results in white. The operation occurs on 2x2 sections independently.\n"
