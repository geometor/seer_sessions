facts:
  - observation: Input grids have variable sizes and multiple colors.
  - observation: Output grids are always 4x4 and predominantly white and green.
  - observation: Input grids appear segmented by color blocks.
  - observation: A specific pattern within input is selected and simplified for the output
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, red, yellow]
      - size: variable
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, green]
      - size: 4x4
  - relationship: InputGrid sections map to OutputGrid sections.
  - relationship: Blue, red and yellow input pixels transform into green output.
  - relationship: White input pixels transform into White output.
  - action: Input grid is reduced in size
  - action: Input grid colors are simplified
