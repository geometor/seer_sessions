**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels into another grid of colored pixels. The input grids are larger and contain a variety of colors (blue, white, red, yellow), while the output grids are consistently smaller and primarily contain white and green pixels. A key observation is that the input grid seems to be divided into distinct sections based on color patterns, and only a specific section, represented by a consistent color swap, makes it to the output grid, contracted in size. The position of the green elements in the output grid appear to be correlated with positions of blue, red, and yellow elements. The output grid size is always 4x4.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grids have variable sizes and multiple colors.
  - observation: Output grids are always 4x4 and predominantly white and green.
  - observation: Input grids appear segmented by color blocks.
  - observation: A specific pattern within input is selected and simplified for the output
  - object: InputGrid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, blue, red, yellow]
      - size: variable
  - object: OutputGrid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, green]
      - size: 4x4
  - relationship: InputGrid sections map to OutputGrid sections.
  - relationship: Blue, red and yellow input pixels transform into green output.
  - relationship: White input pixels transform into White output.
  - action: Input grid is reduced in size
  - action: Input grid colors are simplified
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Sections:** Divide the input grid into four equal sections, similar to quadrants. If the grid's dimensions are not divisible by two consider only the top left section as defined by the output grid size.

2.  **Locate Target Colors:** Identify pixels with the colors blue (1), red (2) and yellow (4) within the input grid sections.

3. **Create Output Grid:** create 4x4 output grid

4.  **Transform and Map:** Within a section of the same size as the output, any pixel that are colors blue, red, and yellow, transform to a green (3).

5. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
