The output is a smaller grid (4x4). The colors in the output grid seem related to some operation on regions of the input grid. The input grid appears to be divided into distinct 2x2 and larger regions of solid color.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

If the section has only ones in it, then the output is 3. If all the numbers in the input section are two, then the output number is 3. If the input section is yellow (4), then the output is 0.\n\n    *   `0 -> 0`\n    *   `1 -> 3`\n    *   `2 -> 3`\n    *   `4 -> 0`\n\n3.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid by filling the subgrids as the result of the mapping.\n\nIn simpler terms, the transformation takes each 2x2 block of the top-left 4x4 region of the input, checks the color of its constituent cells. If cell contains only 0, it is set to 0. If it contains only 1, the cell is changed to 3. If it contains only 2, it is changed to 3. If it contains only 4, it is changed to zero.\n"
