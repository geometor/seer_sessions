Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Scan Input:** Examine the upper-left 4x4 region of the input grid.
2.  **Check for Colors:** For each cell within this region, check if the color is blue (1), red (2), or yellow (4).
3.  **Create Output:** Create a 4x4 output grid, initially filled with white (0).
4.  **Mark Presence:** If a cell in the scanned region of the input grid is blue, red, or yellow, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to green (3). The row and column in the output grid should be identical.
5. If a cell in the scanned region of input grid is not blue, red, or yellow, it is
   not changed (remains white/0).
6. The final output grid has been created.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
