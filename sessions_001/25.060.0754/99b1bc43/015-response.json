The input grid contains various colors (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to simplify the input, focusing on specific areas and using only two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid is a 4x4, while the input is a 9x4 grid. It appears some kind of object or pattern matching, or selection based on the colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
