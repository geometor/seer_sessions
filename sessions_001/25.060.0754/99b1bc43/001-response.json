The input grids are larger and contain a variety of colors (blue, white, red, yellow), while the output grids are consistently smaller and primarily contain white and green pixels. A key observation is that the input grid seems to be divided into distinct sections based on color patterns, and only a specific section, represented by a consistent color swap, makes it to the output grid, contracted in size. The position of the green elements in the output grid appear to be correlated with positions of blue, red, and yellow elements. The output grid size is always 4x4.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

If the grid's dimensions are not divisible by two consider only the top left section as defined by the output grid size.\n\n2.  **Locate Target Colors:** Identify pixels with the colors blue (1), red (2) and yellow (4) within the input grid sections.\n\n3. **Create Output Grid:** create 4x4 output grid\n\n4.  **Transform and Map:** Within a section of the same size as the output, any pixel that are colors blue, red, and yellow, transform to a green (3).\n\n5. White (0) pixels remain unchanged.\n"
