Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colors (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to simplify the input, focusing on specific areas and using only two colors: white (0) and green (3). The output grid is a 4x4, while the input is a 9x4 grid. It appears some kind of object or pattern matching, or selection based on the colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - input:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 9x4
      colors: [0, 1, 2, 4]
      description: "A grid containing white, blue, red, and yellow pixels."
  - output:
      type: grid
      dimensions: 4x4
      colors: [0, 3]
      description: "A grid containing white and green pixels."
  - objects:
      - name: blue_region
        color: 1
        location: input grid, top-left
        description: "contiguous block of 1s (blue)"
      - name: red_region
        color: 2
        location: input_grid, bottom
        description: "contiguous block of 2s(red)"
      - name: yellow_region
        color: 4
        location: input_grid, middle
        description: "contiguous block of 4s (yellow)"
      - name: green_region
         color: 3
         location: output
         description: "blocks of 3s (green) corresponding to the location of the blue, red and yellow regions"
  - transformation:
      type: "selection and replacement"
      rule: "A sub-grid, specifically 4x4, of the input is selected."
      details: "The locations of colors blue(1), red(2) and yellow(4) are marked with green(3), other locations marked with white(0) "
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** Locate connected regions of blue (1), red(2), and yellow(4) pixels in the input grid.

2. **Create the output grid:** A grid of 4x4 is created.

3.  **Mark locations:** If a pixel of value 1, 2, or 4 appears in the input grid, mark its relative position with green (3) in the output grid.
4.  Fill the rest with 0s.

Essentially, the transformation extracts the information that certain colors were present and creates a new grid representing that in a simplified form.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
