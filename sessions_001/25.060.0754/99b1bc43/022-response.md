The transformation takes each 2x2 block of the top-left 4x4 region of the input, checks the color of its constituent cells. If cell contains only 0, it is set to 0. If it contains only 1, the cell is changed to 3. If it contains only 2, it is changed to 3. If it contains only 4, it is changed to zero.
