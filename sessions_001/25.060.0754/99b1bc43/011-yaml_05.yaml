facts:
  - task: "ARC Task"
  - objective: "Determine the transformation rule from input to output grids."
  - input_grid_size: "Variable, between 1x1 and 30x30"
  - output_grid_size: "Variable, related to input size, approximately half in each dimension"
  - colors: "Integers 0-9, representing colors (white, blue, red, green, etc.)"
  - initial_observation: "Input grid is processed in 2x2 non-overlapping blocks."
  - example_1_observation: "If a 2x2 block contains color '1' (blue), the output cell is '3' (green); otherwise, '0' (white)."
  - example_2_observation: "If a 2x2 block contains colors in top left, bottom right, and top right, the output is the color in the bottom left."
  - example_3_observation: "If a 2x2 block contains colors in top left, bottom right, and top right, the output is the color in the bottom left."
  - refined_observation: "The transformation rule is dependent on a 2x2 kernel operation, where each output pixel reflects some property of the corresponding 2x2 section of input pixels."
