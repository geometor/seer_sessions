Both grids are 3x5.  The primary change observed is the movement and color change of a single colored pixel.  All other pixels are white (value 0) and remain unchanged. The colored pixel in the input is red (value 2), and in the output, it's green (value 3). The movement appears to be a specific shift in position.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Return new grid\n\nIn short form: The colored pixel moves diagonally up and to the left by one position, and its color changes from red to green. All other pixels remain white.\n"
