Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on the first training example, which involved removing the top-leftmost non-zero pixel and adding azure and orange pixels diagonally below it. However, the subsequent training examples reveal that this rule is not universally applicable. The core issue is that the initial program overfit to the first example, and we need a more generalized rule. Some examples show that diagonals are added even when the top, leftmost, non-zero pixel is on the edge.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Analyze All Examples:** Examine all input-output pairs, not just the first one, to identify common patterns and variations.
2.  **Object Identification:** Clearly define what constitutes an "object" in each example. In this particular case, the initial assumption, top, leftmost, non-zero object, is accurate and the code is well written for identifying that object.
3.  **Conditional Logic:** Determine the precise conditions under which the diagonal azure and orange pixels are added. It seems there is a relationship.
4. **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the generalized transformation rule.
5. **Iterate**: re-test the code, and make further adjustments if needed.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Here, I'll analyze each training example and summarize the observations. I will use the code to find the top-left most pixel.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
