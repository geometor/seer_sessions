**input:**

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=320x192 at 0x7A17540FBE50>

**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of numerical values (representing colors) into another grid. The input grid contains a single non-zero element (a '2' representing red), while the output grid contains two non-zero elements ('8' representing azure and '7' representing orange) positioned relative to the original non-zero element. The dimensions of the grid remain constant (3x5).

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: Input grid contains a single red pixel (value 2).
  - observation: Output grid contains an azure pixel (value 8) and an orange pixel (value 7).
  - observation: The grid dimensions are the same in both input and output (3x5).
  - relationship: The azure pixel in the output is one row below and one column to the left of the red pixel's original location.
  - relationship: The orange pixel in the output is one row below and one column to the right of the red pixel's original location.
  - action: The original red pixel is removed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate the Object:** Find the single non-zero pixel (the red pixel) in the input grid. Record its row and column indices.

2.  **Create New Objects:**
    *   Create a new azure pixel (value 8). Place it in the grid one row below and one column to the left of the original red pixel's position.
    *   Create a new orange pixel (value 7). Place it in the grid one row below and one column to the right of the original red pixel's position.

3. **Remove and Replace:** Remove/replace the original non-zero pixel.

4.  **Maintain Dimensions:** Keep the output grid the same dimensions as the input grid. All other pixels remain unchanged (value 0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
