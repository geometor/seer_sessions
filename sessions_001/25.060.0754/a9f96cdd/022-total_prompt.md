Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x5 grid containing mostly zeros (white) and a single '2' (red) pixel. The output is also a 3x5 grid, but it contains four non-zero pixels: '3' (green), '6' (magenta), '8' (azure), and '7' (orange). All other pixels are '0' (white). The positions of the non-zero pixels in the output seem unrelated to the position of the '2' in the input. There seems not to be any object motion, mirroring, or rotation. The transformation rule is not about spatial relationships, but maybe, about the non-zero colors and positions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  input_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 5]
    non_zero_pixels:
      - value: 2
        position: [1, 3]
    zero_pixels_count: 14

  output_grid:
    dimensions: [3, 5]
    non_zero_pixels:
      - value: 3
        position: [0, 2]
      - value: 6
        position: [0, 4]
      - value: 8
        position: [2, 2]
      - value: 7
        position: [2, 4]
    zero_pixels_count: 11

  transformation:
      type: color_and_position_change
      input_color: red
      output_colors: [green, magenta, azure, orange]

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The input grid is a 3x5 grid.
2.  Locate the single non-zero pixel in the input grid (which is '2', red).
3.  The size of the output is the same size of the input, 3x5.
4. The output includes only 4 non-zero pixels.
5. The output grid contains four specific colors at specific locations:
    *   Green ('3') at position (0, 2)
    *   Magenta ('6') at position (0, 4)
    *   Azure ('8') at position (2, 2)
    *   Orange ('7') at position (2, 4)
6.  All other pixels in the output grid are '0' (white).
7.  The transformation rule is not dependent on the location of non-zero pixel in the input.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
