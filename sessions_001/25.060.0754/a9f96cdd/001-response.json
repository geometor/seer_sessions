The most prominent feature is the presence of a single red (2) pixel in each input grid. The output grids seem to contain a variety of colors, with no single color dominating. There's also a consistent presence of white (0) pixels in both input and output, acting seemingly as a background. The relationship of the colors in output to the red in the input needs to be discovered.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
