**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a grid of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9) into another grid of the same dimensions. The most prominent feature is the presence of a single red (2) pixel in each input grid. The output grids seem to contain a variety of colors, with no single color dominating. There's also a consistent presence of white (0) pixels in both input and output, acting seemingly as a background. The relationship of the colors in output to the red in the input needs to be discovered.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x5
      - cell_values: [0-9]
      - single_red_pixel: True
      - red_pixel_value: 2

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x5
      - cell_values: [0-9]
      - multiple_colored_pixels: True

actions:
  - name: transform
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    description: Maps the input grid to the output grid based on the position of the red pixel.

relationships:
   - type: position_based_transformation
     description: The position of the Red pixel in the input determines the location and colors of multiple pixels in output.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Red Pixel:** Locate the single red pixel (value 2) within the input grid.

2.  **Create the Output Grid with all background:** Initialize an output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with white pixels (value 0).

3.  **Create colors on the output:**
    *   If the red pixel is in position (r, c) then create a 3, 6, 8, 7 colored pixels in the output grid based on the input.
        - input (0,1) outputs (0,0)=3, (0,2)=6
        - input (2,4) outputs (1,3)=3
        - input (0,2) outputs (1,1)=8, (1,3)=7
        - input (1,3) outputs (0,2)=3, (0,4)=6, (2,2)=8, (2,4)=7

4. **Return the Output Grid**: The output grid is created by assigning the defined pixels from the input grid's Red pixel.

Based on the analysis, it's very hard to come up with a single program since some of the input and output relationship seems random.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
