The input grid appears to contain isolated single-color regions (shapes) of colors yellow(4), orange(7), and green(3), and the background is white(0). The output grid seems to be a condensed and simplified representation of the input, retaining only some of the colored pixels and rearranging them. The spatial relationships between the colored regions in the input are somewhat preserved but significantly altered in the output. There appears to be an emphasis on the vertical and horizontal extent of the original shapes.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

Keep only the first and last row of the yellow regions and remove interior rows. Keep first and last columns.\n    *   Orange (7) and Green (3): Merge vertically adjacent or overlapping regions of the orange and green. Create a rectangle for each color.\n    * construct vertical orange and green regions by combining all vertically adjacent pixels of the same color\n    * merge them together when neighbors\n    * place the merge area into the condensed output\n\n3. condense the image by removing all rows that are only white pixels\n\n4.
