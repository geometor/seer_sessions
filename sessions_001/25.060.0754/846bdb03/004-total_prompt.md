Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The grids contain single-digit integers representing different colors.  The output grid seems to be a condensed or extracted version of the input grid, retaining only specific colored pixels and seemingly reducing the overall size and complexity. There are a few key colors that appear to be important (red, blue, yellow), while others (white/0) are mostly discarded. The spatial relationships (adjacency, relative position) between the colored pixels seem crucial.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 13x13
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - dimensions: 6x8
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - name: red_pixels
    type: object cluster
    properties:
       - color: red (2)
       - shape: appears to form a contiguous "blob" or vertical structure in input.
       
  - name: blue_pixels
    type: object cluster
    properties:
      - color: blue (1)
      - shape: Forms a mostly horizontal or L like contiguous structure in input.

  - name: yellow_pixels
    type: object cluster
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - shape: appears as corner single pixels and at bottom of the red vertical structure.

actions:
  - name: extraction
    description: Selected pixels from the input grid are copied to the output grid.
  - name: size_reduction
    description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid.
  - name: spatial_rearrangement
    description: the relative position between the clusters might change.

relationships:
  - input_grid contains red_pixels, blue_pixels, and yellow_pixels.
  - output_grid contains a subset of red_pixels, blue_pixels, and yellow_pixels from input.
  - red shape "interacts" with blue pixels on their right and yellow pixels
    below.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Structures:** Locate the contiguous "blob" of red (2) pixels, the horizontal/L shaped structure of blue (1) pixels, and the single yellow (4) pixels positioned at the corners and bottom of the red blob in the input grid.

2.  **Extract Core:** Extract the identified red structure.

3.  **Extract Connected:** Extract the connected blue structure to the right of the
    red structure.

4. **Extract Yellow Corners**: Extract the single yellow pixels located in the
   top and bottom right corners of the image and below the red structure.

5.  **Reconstruct:**
    - Create the outline of the output by taking only the corner pixels.
    - Fill in the red structure.
    - Fill in the blue structure to the right.

In simpler terms: The transformation extracts the connected red, the adjacent blue, and the specific yellow pixels from the input grid, maintaining their relative positions (though scaled down), and discards everything else. It then reconstructs a smaller grid based on these extracted elements. The program focuses on specific color clusters and their spatial relationship within the structure.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
