  - action: condensation
    description: The input grid is reduced in size to create the output grid.

  - relationship: spatial_correspondence
    description:  Colored regions in the input generally map to corresponding colored regions in the output, with changes in shape and position.

  - action: shape_simplification
    description:  Elongated regions are reduced and may merge
