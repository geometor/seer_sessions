task_description: |
  The input grid contains colored regions of yellow (4), orange (7), and green (3).
  The transformation extracts and simplifies these regions.
  Yellow regions are reduced to their corner pixels.
  Orange and green regions are combined where they are adjacent, forming a contiguous filled shape.
  The output grid is a condensed representation of these simplified regions.

objects:
  - name: YellowRegion
    color: 4
    properties:
      - shape: rectangle
      - simplification: corners
  - name: OrangeRegion
    color: 7
    properties:
      - shape: rectangle
      - simplification: fill
  - name: GreenRegion
    color: 3
    properties:
        - shape: rectangle
        - simplification: fill
  - name: CombinedOrangeGreenRegion
    color: [3,7]
    properties:
      - shape: any
      - simplification: fill

actions:
  - identify_regions: Find contiguous areas of the same color.
  - simplify_yellow: Reduce yellow regions to their corner pixels.
  - merge_orange_green: combines orange (7) and green (3) regions where adjacent.
  - condense_grid: Remove empty rows and columns to create the output.
