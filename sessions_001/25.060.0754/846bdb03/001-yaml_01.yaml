objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (changes between input and output)
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9) representing colors
  - type: stem
    properties:
      - color: varies (red, blue, green, azure, orange)
      - orientation: vertical
      - length: variable
      - connected: True #pixels are adjacent
  - type: corner
    properties:
      - color: yellow (4)
      - position: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
      - persistent: True # appears in both input and output

actions:
  - compress: reduces the dimensions of the grid
  - rearrange: positions objects within the new grid dimensions
  - summarize: captures the essence of vertical stems in a condensed form

relationships:
  - stems: adjacent to other stems of different colors
  - corners: mark boundaries of the output grid
  - input-output:  a mapping where the input grid is transformed to the output grid
