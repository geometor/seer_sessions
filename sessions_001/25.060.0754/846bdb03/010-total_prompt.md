Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The input grid appears to contain several distinct objects formed by contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color. There are objects of color 3 (green), 8 (azure), and 4 (yellow). The background is 0 (white). The output grid seems to be a cropped and rearranged version of the input, retaining only some of the colored objects and changing their relative positions. It appears that the objects are treated as individual units that can be moved and cropped. The colors of the objects are preserved during transformation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: 3  # Green
    shape: Irregular, but generally vertical
    initial_position: Middle of the grid
    final_position: Right side of the output
  - color: 8  # Azure
    shape: Irregular, but mostly vertical, some horizontal
    initial_position: Multiple locations, including left side and surrounding the green object
    final_position: Left side of the output, some parts removed
  - color: 4  # Yellow
    shape: Two separate single-pixel objects
    initial_position: Top Left and bottom left of the input grid
    final_position: Top Left and bottom left of the output grid, one pixel each

actions:
  - type: Cropping
    description: The output grid is significantly smaller than the input grid, indicating cropping.
  - type: Object Selection
    description: Only the colors 3, 8, and 4 are present in the output, with some parts of objects removed
  - type: Object Movement/Rearrangement
    description: The relative positions of the objects are changed. The Green(3) object, initially surrounded by azure, now sits on the Right. The Azure(8) object sits on the left.
  - type: Size change
    description: The size of the objects changed between input and output
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Recognize distinct objects in the input grid based on contiguous regions of the same color. Specifically, focus on objects with colors 3 (green), 8 (azure), and 4 (yellow).

2.  **Select boundary**: Find two yellow(4) pixels.

3.  **Crop:** Crop the input grid to form output grid. Horizontal boundaries are from first row to the row where the yellow objects are. Vertical boundaries are from the leftmost position of the yellow object to the rightmost position of the object +7 columns to the right.

4. **Reposition:**
    *   Place the yellow(4) pixels on the top left and bottom left corner in output.
    *   Place the green object to the right edge of the output.
    *   Place the azure object to the left edge of the output.

5.  **Resize**: Adjust objects to fit them into new configuration

6.  **Fill**: Fill remaining areas with white(0) background color.

7. Preserve colours of objects


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
