Previous Code:
```python
"""
The input grid is replicated within a larger 18x18 output grid. The replication factors are determined by the dimensions of the input grid, ensuring the replicated pattern stays within the bounds of the 18x18 output. The remaining cells of the output are filled with zeros.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as an 18x18 array filled with zeros.
    output_grid = np.zeros((18, 18), dtype=int)

    # Get the dimensions of the input grid.
    input_height, input_width = input_grid.shape

    # Determine vertical and horizontal replication factors.
    vertical_replications = min(2, 18 // input_height)
    horizontal_replications = min(6, 18 // input_width)

    # Replicate the input grid.
    for i in range(vertical_replications):
        for j in range(horizontal_replications):
            output_grid[i*input_height:(i+1)*input_height, j*input_width:(j+1)*input_width] = input_grid

    return output_grid

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
