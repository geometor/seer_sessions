            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and, subsequently, the code:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code, designed to replicate the input grid 5x5 times, works correctly for the first training example. However, the subsequent examples reveal a more complex pattern related to object replication and arrangement, rather than simple grid replication. The core issue is that the initial assumption of a 5x5 grid replication is incorrect. The replication factor and arrangement seems to depend on the objects within the input grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** We need to shift from thinking about the entire grid to focusing on individual objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) within the grid.\n2.  **Replication Logic:** Determine how many times each *object* is replicated, and in what pattern.\n3.  **Relative Positioning:** Analyze how the replicated objects are positioned relative to each other and the original object. It appears that replications are happening in four directions and potentially involve concepts of mirroring or reflection.\n4. **Object Interaction:** Some objects may interact in interesting ways, for example overlapping, we need to capture information like this.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo develop accurate metrics, I will use the `display_grid()` to show the IO pairs, and use `get_objects()` to identify objects.\n\n```tool_code\ntask = Task('d515c47b')\n\nfor label, set_type in [('train', task.train), ('test', task.test)]:\n    print(f'--- {label.upper()} EXAMPLES ---')\n    for ex_num, example in enumerate(set_type):\n        print(f'Example {ex_num + 1}:')\n        print(f'{label.capitalize()} Input:')\n        display_grid(example.input_grid)\n        print(f'{label.capitalize()} Output:')\n        display_grid(example.output_grid)\n        print(f'Objects in {label} Input:')\n        input_objects = get_objects(example.input_grid)\n        for obj_num, obj in enumerate(input_objects):\n            print(f\"  Object {obj_num+1}: Color={obj.color}, Size={obj.size}, Position={obj.position}, Shape={obj.shape}\")\n            print(f'    Coordinates = {obj.coordinates}')\n\n        predicted_output = transform(example.input_grid)\n\n        print(\"Transformed Input:\")\n        display_grid(predicted_output)\n        if np.array_equal(predicted_output, example.output_grid):\n            print('Passed')\n        else:\n            print('Failed')\n\n```"
