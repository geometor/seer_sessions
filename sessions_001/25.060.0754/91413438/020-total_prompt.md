Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is an 18x18 grid. The input grid contains cells with values of 0 (white) and 2 (red). The output grid appears to be a replication of the input grid, but expanded and padded with zeros. The core pattern of the input (red and white pixels) seems to be tiled across the top-left corner of the output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red

  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 18x18
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
      - value: 2
        color: red
    relationship: expanded replication of input_grid

  - action: replication
    subject: input_grid
    description: The input grid pattern is repeated to form a larger grid.
    details: "input grid tiles repeated across first two rows of output, 3 times"
    
  - action: padding
    description: the expanded output grid has 0s everywhere, acting as padding
    details: the remaining grid (rows 3-18) are all zero

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Replicate:** The 3x3 input grid is replicated six times horizontally and is repeated on rows one and two of the larger 18 x 18 output array.
2.  **Padding:** The rest of the output grid (rows 3-18) is filled entirely with zeros (white pixels).

In essence, the input grid's pattern acts like a "stamp" that's repeated six times in x and two times in y, before zero padding the rest of the array.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
