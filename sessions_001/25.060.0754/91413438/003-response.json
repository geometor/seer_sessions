Each cell contains either a 0 (white) or a 6 (magenta).\n*   **Output:** A 12x12 grid. The original 3x3 input grid appears to be replicated and tiled in the top-left corner, and padded with a large white (0) area. Specifically the input is repeated four times in each of rows 1, 2, and 3. Rows 4, 5, and 6 are the input, padded by 9 columns of white.\n* **Transformation:** It seems like the core concept involves repeating the entire input grid, both horizontally and vertically.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
