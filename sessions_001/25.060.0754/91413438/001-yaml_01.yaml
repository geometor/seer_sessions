facts:
  - type: grid
    description: Input and output are 2D grids of colored pixels.
  - property: color
    values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6] # white, blue, red, green, yellow, magenta
    mapping:  {0: white, 1: blue, 2: red, 3: green, 4: yellow, 6: magenta}
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: variable (e.g., 3x3)
      - content: colored pixels
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: larger than input_grid, variable
      - content: replicated input_grid pattern, padded with white (0) pixels
  - action: replication
    description: The input grid is replicated horizontally and vertically.
  - relationship: input_to_output
    description:  The output grid is a patterned replication of the input grid, potentially with varying replication factors in each dimension, and padding.
  - observation: input_size
    description: The input grid is always 3x3.
  - observation: output_pattern
    description: The output grid repeats the input grid. And adds white rows and columns to make the size variable.
  - observation: variability_size
    description: examples 1 and 2 the height x width are the multiples of the input 3. However, it isn't true for example 3.
