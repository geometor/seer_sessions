observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - shape: variable, (rows, cols)
      - content: integers representing colors
      - contains: single blue pixel (value 1)

  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - shape: (3 * input_rows, 3 * input_cols)
      - content: integers representing colors
      - pattern: 3x3 tiling of the input grid
      - modification: three consecutive rows are zeroed out

  - action: tiling
    description: The input grid is replicated nine times in a 3x3 pattern.

  - action: zeroing
    description: Three consecutive rows in the tiled grid are set to all zeros.
    parameters:
      start_row: blue_row * 3
      end_row: (blue_row * 3) + 2

  - relationship: blue_pixel_row_determines_zeroed_rows
    description: The row index of the blue pixel in the input grid, multiplied by 3, determines the starting row index of the zeroed rows in the output grid.
