Cells contain either '0' (white) or '4' (yellow).\n*   **Output:** A 15x15 grid. It appears to be an expansion of the input grid, with some replication of the input pattern. The original 3x3 input grid appears to be repeated in the top-left corner, and then further alterations happen.\n*.  **Colors:** Only two colors are involved: white (0) and yellow (4).\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
