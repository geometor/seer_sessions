There are distinct shapes formed by the colored pixels.\n*   **Output:** The output grid is almost identical to the input, but with some color changes. Specifically, some blue (1) pixels are changed to red (2), and some red (2) pixels are changed to blue(1). The gray (5) pixels seem to be unchanged\n* **Transformation:** It seems to be copying the input and switching some colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
