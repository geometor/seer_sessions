The primary colors involved appear to be gray (5), blue (1), red (2), green (3), and white(0). The transformations seem to involve replacing certain colored objects (contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color) with objects of a different color, while often retaining the shape. Gray areas may be acting as background. The shapes formed look like plus signs, rectangles, and squares.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note down their color, shape, and position. The are colors, and shapes seem to be mostly grey(5) background, and blue(1), red(2), or green(3) shapes.\n\n2.  **Find the substitution**: In each example input-output, a single shape with blue color exists, and this shape and position exists with another color in the output. Find this blue shape and the color that replaces.\n\n3. **Apply Transformation**: Apply the color substitution found in step 2.\n\nIn summary, the core transformation is the substitution of a shape's color, specifically a blue shape, by the color of the other non-gray shape present in the input.\n"
