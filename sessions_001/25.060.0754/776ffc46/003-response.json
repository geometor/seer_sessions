The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), red (2), and blue (1). The input grid seems to have distinct \"objects\" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. Specifically, there are gray borders, red \"plus\" shapes, and blue \"plus\" shapes, with some of these blue plus shapes located within the inner grid, and one blue shape on the gray border on the lower left corner. The output grid seems to retain the gray borders and the relative locations and sizes of these colored shapes, however one blue plus shape at the center has become a red plus shape.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"

These are defined as five contiguous pixels of the same color arranged in a plus shape. There are instances in both red (2) and blue (1).\n\n3. **Conditional Transform based on the position and color:** If any plus shapes on the inside region of the grid are blue (1), then change only one of them (if there are multiple blue shape, only change one) into a red (2) plus shape.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Elements**: Keep the gray border and all other shapes unchanged. The transformed shapes stay in the same place, it's just the one color that changes.\n"
