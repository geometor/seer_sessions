Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 20x20 grids containing colored pixels. The primary colors observed are gray (5), white (0), red (2), and blue (1). The input grid seems to have distinct "objects" formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. Specifically, there are gray borders, red "plus" shapes, and blue "plus" shapes, with some of these blue plus shapes located within the inner grid, and one blue shape on the gray border on the lower left corner. The output grid seems to retain the gray borders and the relative locations and sizes of these colored shapes, however one blue plus shape at the center has become a red plus shape.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 20x20
    properties:
      - border_color: gray (5)
      - cell_values: [0, 1, 2, 5]

  - type: shape
    name: plus
    properties:
      - colors: [red (2), blue (1)]
      - structure: contiguous block of 5 pixels in a plus shape
      - locations: varied within the grid, center, edge, and within borders

actions:
  - type: color_change
    description: One instance of the blue plus shape that is within the border is changing to a red plus shape.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Shapes are positioned within the grid, some on the border, some within inner part of the border.
  - type: color_based
    description: The blue plus shape within the border area changes its color to become a red plus shape.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the border**: Recognize the gray (5) pixels forming a border around the grid.

2.  **Locate Shapes**: Find all "plus" shaped objects within the grid. These are defined as five contiguous pixels of the same color arranged in a plus shape. There are instances in both red (2) and blue (1).

3. **Conditional Transform based on the position and color:** If any plus shapes on the inside region of the grid are blue (1), then change only one of them (if there are multiple blue shape, only change one) into a red (2) plus shape.

4.  **Preserve Other Elements**: Keep the gray border and all other shapes unchanged. The transformed shapes stay in the same place, it's just the one color that changes.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
