Okay, here's a breakdown of my observations and the proposed transformation rule for the given input-output example.

**Perception of Elements**

*   **Colors:** The grids contain multiple colors: white (0), gray (5), green (3), and blue (1).
*   **Shapes:** There are rectangular shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. Specifically, gray and green shapes in the top half and blue shapes in the bottom half of input.
* **Change of color of blue object to green:** Blue shapes transform to green.

**YAML Documentation**



```yaml
facts:
  - object_1:
      type: shape
      color: gray
      description: Large rectangle in the top half
      change: none
  - object_2:
    type: shape
    color: green
    description: small rectangle contained in the gray shape
    change: none
  - object_3:
      type: shape
      color: blue
      description: Irregular shapes and isolated pixels
      change: color change to green
  - relationship:
    type: spatial
    objects:
      - object_1
      - object_2
    description: object_2 inside object_1
```



**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Blue Objects:** Locate all blue (1) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Change the color**: if the pixel is equal to 1, change to 3, keep other pixels as the input.
3. output the transformed grid.
