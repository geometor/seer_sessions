Okay, I've examined the input and output grids for the `train_4` example. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The colors present are white (0), gray (5), green (3), and blue (1). There are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The primary change between the input and output seems to be related to the blue (1) regions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: shape
    color: gray (5)
    description: Large, irregular shape occupying the top-left and middle portions of the grid.
  - type: shape
    color: green (3)
    description: Two separate rectangular shapes, one near the top-right and another overlapping the gray shape.
  - type: shape
    color: blue (1)
    description: Irregular shapes, primarily in the lower half of the grid. Multiple distinct blue shapes exist.
  - type: background
    color: white(0)
    descrition: everything else

actions:
  - type: color_change
    target: blue shapes
    from_color: 1
    to_color: 3
    condition: "partially covers one area of blue shape, and is adjacent to green, and does not extend across the grid"
    
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: The blue shapes are adjacent to white pixels and, in some cases, gray and green pixels.
  - type: containment
    description: The blue shapes can partially cover and be adjacent to some white, grey, and green areas of the input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all contiguous regions (shapes) of blue (1) pixels.
2.  **Locate** the largest contiguous region of green(3).
3.  **Check** to see that the contiguous blue region overlaps with the green and covers some pixels
4.  **Change** the color of one of the blue regions from blue (1) to green (3).

The core concept is that where blue shapes partially cover a white region, adjacent to and covering a portion of the largest green region, the blue shape changes to the color green.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
