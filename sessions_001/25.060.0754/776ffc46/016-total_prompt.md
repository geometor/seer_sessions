Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input:** A 20x20 grid with pixels of different colors: white (0), blue (1), red (2), and gray (5). There are distinct shapes formed by the colored pixels.
*   **Output:** The output grid is almost identical to the input, but with some color changes. Specifically, some blue (1) pixels are changed to red (2), and some red (2) pixels are changed to blue(1). The gray (5) pixels seem to be unchanged
* **Transformation:** It seems to be copying the input and switching some colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 20x20
    elements: pixels
    element_types:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: blue
        value: 1
      - color: red
        value: 2
      - color: gray
        value: 5
  - type: shape
    description: Contiguous block of pixels of the same color.

actions:
  - name: color_swap
    type: transformation
    details: Swaps colors of certain shapes based on their original color.
    conditions:
       - if original color == blue, new_color == red
       - if original color == red, new_color == blue
       - else no change

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid. Shapes are formed by adjacent pixels of the same color.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Copy the entire input grid to the output grid.
2.  Identify all contiguous shapes of blue (1) color. Change the entire block of blue to red color (value 2).
3.  Identify all contiguous shapes of red (2) color. Change the entire block of red to blue color (value 1)
4. Leave other color blocks unchanged.

In short - swap all blue blocks to red, and all red blocks to blue, keep everything else the same.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
