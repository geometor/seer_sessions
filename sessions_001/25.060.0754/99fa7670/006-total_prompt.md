Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify colored pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each colored pixel, expand it horizontally to the left and right edges of the grid, changing all pixels in that row to the color of the original pixel.
3.  **Vertical Expansion:** after the row expansion, expand each colored pixel downwards until each column is occupied.

In other words. For the row that a colored object is in, replace the entire row
with the color. Then take each column and fill downwards until you hit the
bottom of the grid.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the described rules.
    """
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    rows, cols = output_grid.shape

    # Identify colored pixels and perform horizontal expansion
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if output_grid[r, c] != 0:
                color = output_grid[r, c]
                output_grid[r, :] = color  # Fill entire row with the color

    # Vertical Expansion downwards
    for c in range(cols):
      for r in range(rows):
        if output_grid[r,c] != 0:
          color = output_grid[r,c]
          for r_below in range(r+1, rows):
            output_grid[r_below, c] = color

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine the natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and generated code were partially correct, capturing the horizontal expansion aspect. However, the vertical expansion was incomplete and incorrect. The original program expanded *all* colored pixels downwards. The examples show that the downward expansion should *stop* when it encounters a pixel that is already colored or, a colored pixel that isn't white(0).

The strategy to resolve this is to:

1.  **Re-examine the examples:** Pay close attention to how colors interact during the vertical expansion, especially when different colored rows meet.
2.  **Refine the vertical expansion logic:** Modify the natural language program to specify stopping conditions for downward expansion.
3.  **Use Code Execution:** get metrics to understand and validate new observations.
4.  **Update YAML and Natural Language Program:**

**Code Execution for Metrics and Observations**

I will create a function that I can call in the code_execution tool.

```python
def analyze_results(task_data):
    results = []
    for example in task_data['train']:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
        is_correct = np.array_equal(predicted_output_grid, expected_output_grid)

        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': expected_output_grid.shape,
            'predicted_output_shape': predicted_output_grid.shape,
            'correct': is_correct,
            'first_incorrect_pixel': find_first_difference(expected_output_grid, predicted_output_grid) if not is_correct else None,

        })
    return results

def find_first_difference(grid1, grid2):
    """Find the first pixel where two grids differ."""
    size = grid1.shape
    for i in range(size[0]):
      for j in range(size[1]):
          if grid1[i,j] != grid2[i,j]:
            return (i,j)
    return None
```

I will now call this function and get the `results`
```tool_code

task_data = json.loads(task_path.read_text())

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
