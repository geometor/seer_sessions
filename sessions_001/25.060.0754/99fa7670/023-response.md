Here's an analysis of the provided information and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the generated code correctly capture the core concept of expanding non-zero pixels to the right. However, the provided training set results reveal that the program, lacks a crucial detail: it doesn't consider that black(0) pixels act as "barriers", stopping color expansion, and black(0) should also expand, not only non-zero pixels. The strategy should involve, therefore, a correction of the initial assumption.

**Metrics and Observations:**

To confirm assumptions, and get better insight, let us look at the grids.

```tool_code
def grid_as_string(grid):
    return '\n'.join([' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in grid])

for example in task['train']:
    input_grid = example['input']
    expected_output_grid = example['output']
    predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
    match = np.array_equal(predicted_output_grid,expected_output_grid)
    print(f"{'Input':-^45}")
    print(grid_as_string(input_grid))
    print(f"{'Expected Output':-^45}")
    print(grid_as_string(expected_output_grid))
    print(f"{'Predicted Output':-^45}")
    print(grid_as_string(predicted_output_grid))
    print(f"{'Match':-^45}")
    print(match)
```
