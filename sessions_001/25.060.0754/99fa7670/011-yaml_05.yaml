examples:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: blue (1)
          location: (1, 1)
          shape: single pixel
      output_objects:
        - color: blue (1)
          location: (1, 1)
          shape: 2x2 square
      transformation: single pixel becomes 2x2 square
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: gray (5)
          location: (1, 2)
          shape: single pixel
      output_objects:
          - color: gray (5)
            location: (1,2)
            shape: 2x2 square
      transformation: single pixel becomes 2x2 square

          - color: green (3)
            location: (2,3)
            shape: single pixel
      output_objects:
          - color: green(3)
            location: (2,3)
            shape: 2x2 square
      transformation: single pixel becomes 2x2 square
  - example_4:
    input_objects:
        - color: red (2)
          location: (0,1)
          shape: single pixel
    output_objects:
        - color: red (2)
          location: (0,1)
          shape: 2x2 square
    transformation: single pixel becomes 2x2 square
