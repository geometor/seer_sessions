The input grid contains two distinct colored pixels (red=2 and green=3) against a background of white (0). The output grid shows that the colored pixels have expanded to fill their respective rows and then extend downwards, filling the remaining rows below them. The expansion seems to occur in both directions from the original colored pixel.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
