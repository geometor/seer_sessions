Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit representing a color. The input grids contain a few colored cells, with the majority being '0' (white). The transformation seems to involve expanding the non-zero colored cells. The shape of the input grid is identical to its output grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: rows x columns (variable)
      - cells: contain integer values (0-9) representing colors

  - type: colored_cell
    properties:
      - color: integer value (1-9)
      - location: row, column index within the grid

actions:
  - type: expand
    properties:
      - direction: horizontal and vertical
      - extent: to the right and down

relationships:
  - colored_cells are contained within the grid
  - expansion of colored_cells modifies the grid
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all non-zero colored cells within the input grid.
2.  For each identified colored cell:
    *   **Extend** the cell's color horizontally to the right edge of the grid.
    *   **Extend** the color of all cells in this extended row, downwards to fill the input grid shape.

Essentially, each non-zero cell's color is propagated rightward and then downward, overwriting any existing colors. The key is the order: right, then fill down from the extended row.
