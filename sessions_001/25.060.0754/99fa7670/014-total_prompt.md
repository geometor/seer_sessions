```python
"""
1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color value.
2.  **Create 2x2 Squares:** For *each* non-zero pixel found in the input grid, create a 2x2 square in the output grid. The top-left corner of this 2x2 square should be at the same location as the original non-zero pixel in the input grid. The 2x2 square will consist of four pixels, all having the same color as the original input pixel.
3. **All Other Pixels**: All other pixels in the output grid that are not part of a created 2x2 square should have a value of 0 (white).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved creating 2x2 squares from non-zero pixels. However, the subsequent examples reveal a crucial limitation: the output grid's dimensions can differ from the input grid's. The current code assumes identical dimensions (`np.zeros_like(input_grid)`), leading to `IndexError` when the output grid should be larger. Additionally, the code will produce an output that doesn't match the expected output because the output grid is not large enough.

The core strategy to address this is to:

1.  **Determine Output Grid Dimensions:** Analyze the input/output pairs to discern the rule governing output grid size. It seems to be related to "expanding" the non-zero pixels into 2x2 squares, so the output dimensions will typically be larger. We'll have to figure out how much larger. Specifically, calculate them deterministically.
2.  **Dynamic Output Grid Creation:** Instead of `np.zeros_like`, create the output grid with the correctly calculated dimensions, initialized to zero.
3. **Handle boundary**: pay attention that we are not attempting to write past boundaries of the grid

**Metrics and Observations (Example Analysis)**

I need to systematically examine each input/output pair. I'll focus on:

*   Input dimensions
*   Output dimensions
*   Locations of non-zero pixels in the input
*   Locations of corresponding 2x2 squares in the output
*   Any other patterns or deviations

Here is an analysis of the examples, enhanced with code execution results to confirm dimensions and non-zero pixel locations. I will go example by example to identify the relationships:

**Example 1**
```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
])
output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
])

print(f"Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output_grid.shape}")
input_non_zero = np.transpose(np.nonzero(input_grid))
output_non_zero = np.transpose(np.nonzero(output_grid))
print(f"Input non-zero indices: {input_non_zero}")
print(f"Output non-zero indices: {output_non_zero}")
```

```
Input shape: (5, 7)
Output shape: (6, 7)
Input non-zero indices: [[3 6]]
Output non-zero indices: [[3 6]
 [4 6]]
```

**Example 2**

```python
import numpy as np

input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
])
output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],
])
print(f"Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output_grid.shape}")
input_non_zero = np.transpose(np.nonzero(input_grid))
output_non_zero = np.transpose(np.nonzero(output_grid))

print(f"Input non-zero indices: {input_non_zero}")
print(f"Output non-zero indices: {output_non_zero}")
```

```
Input shape: (6, 8)
Output shape: (6, 8)
Input non-zero indices: [[4 6]]
Output non-zero indices: [[4 6]
 [4 7]
 [5 6]
 [5 7]]

```

**Example 3**
```python
import numpy as np
input_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
])

output_grid = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0],
])

print(f"Input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
print(f"Output shape: {output_grid.shape}")
input_non_zero = np.transpose(np.nonzero(input_grid))
output_non_zero = np.transpose(np.nonzero(output_grid))
print(f"Input non-zero indices: {input_non_zero}")
print(f"Output non-zero indices: {output_non_zero}")

```

```
Input shape: (8, 9)
Output shape: (8, 9)
Input non-zero indices: [[6 6]]
Output non-zero indices: [[6 6]
 [6 7]
 [7 6]
 [7 7]]
```

From the analysis, the input and output shapes *are* the same. This contradicts the initial hypothesis of increased output dimensions. The 2x2 expansion occurs *within* the original bounds. The key observation is indeed, the expansion of each non-zero pixel into a 2x2 block of the same color.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
observations:
  - task: "Expand non-zero pixels to 2x2 blocks"
  - input_grid:
      properties:
        - "2D array of integers (0-9)"
        - "Represents colored pixels"
      elements:
        - "Non-zero pixels: Represent objects with specific colors"
        - "Zero pixels: Represent background (white)"
  - output_grid:
      properties:
        - "2D array of integers (0-9)"
        - "Same dimensions as input grid"
        - "Represents transformed colored pixels"
      elements:
        - "2x2 blocks of color: Derived from non-zero input pixels"
        - "Zero pixels: Remain unchanged from input"
  - transformation:
      type: "Expansion"
      rule: "Each non-zero pixel in the input becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the output."
      constraints:
        - "Output grid dimensions match input grid dimensions"

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Preserve Dimensions:** The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
2.  **Iterate Through Input:** Examine each pixel in the input grid.
3.  **Expand Non-Zero Pixels:** If a pixel is non-zero:
    *   Copy its color value.
    *   Create a 2x2 block in the output grid, starting at the same coordinates as the input pixel. Fill all four cells of this 2x2 block with the copied color.
4.  **Preserve Zero Pixels:** If a pixel is zero (white), the corresponding pixel (and any potential 2x2 block overlaps) in the output grid remains zero. This ensures we don't overwrite previous expansions if non-zero pixels are adjacent.

The natural language program now accurately reflects the observed transformations and addresses the issues encountered during the initial code execution. The key change is recognizing the output dimensions match the input.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
