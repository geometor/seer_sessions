**input:**
```
0 0 0
0 6 0
0 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A17540FBED0>

**output:**
```
0 0 0
0 6 6
0 0 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A17540FB850>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains a single magenta (6) pixel in the center, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid retains the central magenta pixel but adds two more magenta pixels: one to the right of the original, and one below. The core transformation seems to involve replicating the non-zero pixel based on a specific pattern.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      The input and output grids are 3x3.
  - object: |
     A single magenta (6) pixel exists in the center of the input grid (row 1, column 1, using 0-indexing).
  - context: |
     All other pixels in the input grid are white (0).
  - action: |
      Two new magenta (6) pixels appear in output grid.
  - relation_input:
      input grid is 3 x 3 and the magenta object is at [1,1]
  - relation_output:
      output grid is 3 x 3 and the magenta objects are at: [[1,1], [1,2], [2,1]]
  - transformation: |
      The original magenta pixel is maintained.
      A magenta pixel is added to the right of the original.
      A magenta pixel is added below the original.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the non-zero pixel:** Find the pixel in the input grid that has a value other than 0. In this instance we know there will be one, but generally this should be the first step
2.  **Maintain Original:** Keep the identified non-zero pixel in the same position in the output grid.
3.  **Replicate Right:** Create a copy of the non-zero pixel and place it one position to the right of the original in the output grid.
4.  **Replicate Down:** Create a copy of the non-zero pixel and place it one position below the original in the output grid.
5.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All other pixels in the output grid should retain the value of 0, as in the input grid.

Essentially the non zero pixel from input [i,j] becomes three pixels in the output: [i,j], [i, j+1], [i+1, j].

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
