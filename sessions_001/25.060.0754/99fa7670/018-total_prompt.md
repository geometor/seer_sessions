Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Identify Objects:** Find all non-zero pixels in the input grid. Each of these represents a distinct object.
2. **Horizontal Expansion**. For each object, starting from its original location, expand the object's color horizontally to the right edge of the grid.
3.  **Vertical Expansion:** Each expanded object will expand down one row
"""

import numpy as np

def find_objects(grid):
    """Finds all non-zero pixels and returns them as a list of (row, col, color) tuples."""
    objects = []
    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[r, c] != 0:
                objects.append((r, c, grid[r, c]))
    return objects

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the described rules."""
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    objects = find_objects(input_grid)

    for r, c, color in objects:
        # Horizontal Expansion
        for c2 in range(c, output_grid.shape[1]):
            output_grid[r, c2] = color
        # Vertical Expansion - one row down.
        if r + 1 < output_grid.shape[0]:
             for c2 in range(c, output_grid.shape[1]):
                output_grid[r+1, c2] = color
    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine our natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on a single example, leading to an oversimplified transformation rule. The core idea of horizontal expansion is partially correct, but the "vertical expansion" is not universally applicable. The code fails to correctly handle cases where the objects should not expand downwards, or where the expansion logic is different. My initial assumptions were not correct.

My strategy to address these issues is as follows:

1.  **Analyze all examples:** Carefully examine each input-output pair in the training set to identify common patterns and variations in the transformation rule.
2.  **Refine object definition:** Determine if the current definition of "object" (any non-zero pixel) is sufficient or needs modification.
3.  **Identify correct expansion logic:** Discard the initial vertical expansion rule. Focus on determining when and how objects expand, paying close attention to the boundaries and interactions between objects.
4.  **Refactor natural language description**: describe the entire process for this task, start to finish.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To get precise details, I'll analyze the provided images of the input, expected output, and actual output grids.

```tool_code
print(f"""
Example 1:
Input Shape: (3, 3)
Output Shape: (3, 3)
Correct: {np.array_equal(transform(train_input_1), train_output_1)}

Example 2:
Input Shape: (3, 5)
Output Shape: (3, 5)
Correct: {np.array_equal(transform(train_input_2), train_output_2)}

Example 3:
Input Shape: (5, 5)
Output Shape: (5, 5)
Correct: {np.array_equal(transform(train_input_3), train_output_3)}
""")
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
