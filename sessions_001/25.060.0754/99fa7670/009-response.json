The input grid contains a single magenta (6) pixel in the center, surrounded by white (0) pixels. The output grid retains the central magenta pixel but adds two more magenta pixels: one to the right of the original, and one below. The core transformation seems to involve replicating the non-zero pixel based on a specific pattern.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
