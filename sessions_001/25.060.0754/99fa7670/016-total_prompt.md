Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains two distinct objects: a single azure (8) pixel and a single gray (5) pixel. The output grid shows these objects expanded. The azure object expands horizontally to fill its row, and then extends downward to fill two rows. The gray object expands horizontally to fill part of its row, then extends downward by one row. It seems non-zero pixels are expanded to the right edge. The expansion continues down based on the original count of the non-zero pixels.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: 1
    color: azure (8)
    initial_position: (1, 1)
    shape: single pixel
    action: expand horizontally and vertically
  - id: 2
    color: gray (5)
    initial_position: (4, 3)
    shape: single pixel
    action: expand horizontally and vertically

relationships:
  - object: 1
    relation: expands to fill row, then fill one additional row.
  - object: 2
    relation: expands to fill remaining cells to right of origin, and then fill one additional row.

grid_properties:
  - rows: 6
  - columns: 6
  - background_color: white (0)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all non-zero pixels in the input grid. Each of these represents a distinct object.
2. **Horizontal Expansion**. For each object, starting from its original location, expand the object's color horizontally to the right edge of the grid.
3.  **Vertical Expansion:** Each expanded object will expand down one row


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
