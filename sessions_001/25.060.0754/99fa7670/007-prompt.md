Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify colored pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that are not white (0).
2.  **Horizontal Expansion:** For each colored pixel, expand it horizontally to the left and right edges of the grid, changing all pixels in that row to the color of the original pixel.
3.  **Vertical Expansion:** After the row expansion, expand each colored pixel downwards. Stop the expansion when encountering a non-white pixel.

In other words. For the row that a colored object is in, replace the entire row
with the color. Then take each column and fill downwards until you hit a
non-white pixel or the bottom of the grid.

    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the described rules.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
