Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Non-Zero Pixels:** Locate all pixels in the input grid that have a non-zero color value.
2.  **Create 2x2 Squares:** For *each* non-zero pixel found in the input grid, create a 2x2 square in the output grid. The top-left corner of this 2x2 square should be at the same location as the original non-zero pixel in the input grid. The 2x2 square will consist of four pixels, all having the same color as the original input pixel.
3. **All Other Pixels**: All other pixels in the output grid that are not part of a created 2x2 square should have a value of 0 (white).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
