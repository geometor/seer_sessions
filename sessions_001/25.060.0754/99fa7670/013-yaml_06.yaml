observations:
  - task: "Expand non-zero pixels to 2x2 blocks"
  - input_grid:
      properties:
        - "2D array of integers (0-9)"
        - "Represents colored pixels"
      elements:
        - "Non-zero pixels: Represent objects with specific colors"
        - "Zero pixels: Represent background (white)"
  - output_grid:
      properties:
        - "2D array of integers (0-9)"
        - "Same dimensions as input grid"
        - "Represents transformed colored pixels"
      elements:
        - "2x2 blocks of color: Derived from non-zero input pixels"
        - "Zero pixels: Remain unchanged from input"
  - transformation:
      type: "Expansion"
      rule: "Each non-zero pixel in the input becomes a 2x2 block of the same color in the output."
      constraints:
        - "Output grid dimensions match input grid dimensions"
