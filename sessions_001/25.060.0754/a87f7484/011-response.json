            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code was overly specific to the first training example. It correctly identified the presence of orange (7) and created a 3x3 output grid, filling specific cells with orange. However, it failed to generalize to other input grids where orange might not be present or where the arrangement should be different. The core issue is that the code doesn't dynamically react to the *input* grid's content; it always produces the same output. We need to shift from hardcoded positions to a rule-based system that examines the input.\n\n**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**\n\n1.  **Detect Orange:** Verify that orange even exists in the input.  If it does not, what should be done?\n2.  **Dynamic Output:** Consider how we'll create the output grid and fill it. If we only place orange, what about all the other cells?\n3.  **Generalize:** The current code will create a 3x3 every time, but this won't solve the task.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nI will analyze each example pair individually and check the suggested code against the expected outputs.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n*   Input: 3x3 grid with some orange pixels.\n*   Expected Output: 3x3 grid with orange in corners and center.\n*   Actual Output: 3x3 grid with orange in corners and center (Matches Expected).\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n*   Input: 5x5 grid with no orange pixels.\n*   Expected Output: 3x3 grid with all white pixels.\n*   Actual Output: 3x3 grid with orange in corners and center (Does NOT Match Expected).\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n*   Input: 3x3 grid with no orange pixels.\n*   Expected output: 3x3 grid with all white pixels.\n*   Actual Output: 3x3 grid with orange in corners and center (Does NOT Match Expected).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n```yaml\nexample_1:\n  input_grid:\n    size: 3x3\n    orange_present: true\n  output_grid:\n    size: 3x3\n    orange_placement: corners and center\n    other_pixels: white\n  result: correct\n\nexample_2:\n  input_grid:\n    size: 5x5\n    orange_present: false\n  output_grid:\n    size: 3x3\n    orange_placement: none\n    other_pixels: white\n  result: incorrect\n\nexample_3:\n  input_grid:\n    size: 3x3\n    orange_present: false\n  output_grid:\n    size: 3x3\n    orange_placement: none\n    other_pixels: white\n  result: incorrect\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Check for Orange:** Examine the input grid to determine if the color orange (value 7) is present.\n2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\n3.  **Conditional Fill:**\n    *   If orange is present in the input grid, fill the corner and center pixels of the output grid with orange (7). Fill the remaining pixels with white (0).\n    *   If orange is *not* present in the input grid, fill the entire output grid with white (0).\n"
