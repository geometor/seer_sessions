**output:**

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output pair:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a 12x3 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. The output grid appears to be a cropped section of the input grid. The colors present in both input and output are white (0), orange (7), green (3), red (2), and azure (8). The cropping seems to focus on the top-left 3x3 section containing only orange and white pixels. Other color sections are discarded.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 12x3
    elements: [0, 7, 3, 2, 8]
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: [0, 7]
  - relation: output_is_cropped_section_of_input
    details: "The output grid corresponds to the top-left 3x3 subgrid of the input grid."
  - action: cropping
    agent: implicit
    target: input_grid
    result: output_grid
    parameters:
       top_left_corner: [0,0]
       crop_size: 3x3

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Input:** The input is a 12x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Crop the Grid:** Extract the 3x3 subgrid starting from the top-left corner (row 0, column 0) of the input grid.
3.  **Output:** The extracted 3x3 subgrid is the output.

In simple terms the transformation is taking the top left hand corner 3 x 3 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
