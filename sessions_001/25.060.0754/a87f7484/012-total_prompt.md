Previous Code:
```python
"""
Identify all pixels with the color orange (value 7) within the input grid.
Create a 3x3 output grid.
Fill the corner and center pixels of the output grid with orange (7) and the others with white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid to the output grid by extracting orange objects and arranging them in a new shape
    """
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)

    # Fill the corner and center pixels of output grid with orange (7) and the others with white (0).
    output_grid[0, 0] = 7
    output_grid[0, 2] = 7
    output_grid[1, 1] = 7
    output_grid[2, 0] = 7
    output_grid[2, 2] = 7

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and formulate an updated natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was overly specific to the first training example. It correctly identified the presence of orange (7) and created a 3x3 output grid, filling specific cells with orange. However, it failed to generalize to other input grids where orange might not be present or where the arrangement should be different. The core issue is that the code doesn't dynamically react to the *input* grid's content; it always produces the same output. We need to shift from hardcoded positions to a rule-based system that examines the input.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Detect Orange:** Verify that orange even exists in the input.  If it does not, what should be done?
2.  **Dynamic Output:** Consider how we'll create the output grid and fill it. If we only place orange, what about all the other cells?
3.  **Generalize:** The current code will create a 3x3 every time, but this won't solve the task.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

I will analyze each example pair individually and check the suggested code against the expected outputs.

**Example 1:**

*   Input: 3x3 grid with some orange pixels.
*   Expected Output: 3x3 grid with orange in corners and center.
*   Actual Output: 3x3 grid with orange in corners and center (Matches Expected).

**Example 2:**

*   Input: 5x5 grid with no orange pixels.
*   Expected Output: 3x3 grid with all white pixels.
*   Actual Output: 3x3 grid with orange in corners and center (Does NOT Match Expected).

**Example 3:**

*   Input: 3x3 grid with no orange pixels.
*   Expected output: 3x3 grid with all white pixels.
*   Actual Output: 3x3 grid with orange in corners and center (Does NOT Match Expected).

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
example_1:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x3
    orange_present: true
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    orange_placement: corners and center
    other_pixels: white
  result: correct

example_2:
  input_grid:
    size: 5x5
    orange_present: false
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    orange_placement: none
    other_pixels: white
  result: incorrect

example_3:
  input_grid:
    size: 3x3
    orange_present: false
  output_grid:
    size: 3x3
    orange_placement: none
    other_pixels: white
  result: incorrect
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Check for Orange:** Examine the input grid to determine if the color orange (value 7) is present.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a 3x3 output grid.
3.  **Conditional Fill:**
    *   If orange is present in the input grid, fill the corner and center pixels of the output grid with orange (7). Fill the remaining pixels with white (0).
    *   If orange is *not* present in the input grid, fill the entire output grid with white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
