**input:**
```
3 0 0 4 0 4 2 0 0 8 0 0 1 0 0
0 3 3 4 4 4 0 2 2 0 8 8 0 1 1

```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=960x192 at 0x7A174C5BAFD0>

**output:**
```
4 0 4
4 4 4
4 0 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A17540E0AD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colored pixels (represented by digits 0-9), while the output grid seems to be a simplified or extracted version of the input. The most prominent color in the output is yellow (4). It appears that a specific region of the input grid is being selected and its dominant color is determined.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x15
      - colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8] # white, blue, red, green, yellow, azure
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3
      - colors: [0, 4] # white, yellow
  - action: select_region
    description: A 3x3 region is selected from the input grid.
    parameters:
      - start_row: 0
      - start_col: 3
  - action: determine_dominant_color
    description: The most frequent non-zero color in selected region is identified
  - relationship:
    - subject: input_grid
    - predicate: contains
    - object: output_grid (as a sub-region, modified)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Select Region:** From the input grid, select a 3x3 sub-grid starting at row 0, column 3 (the first instance of color 4).
2.  **Identify Dominant Color:** Within this 3x3 sub-grid, count the occurrences of each non-zero color.
3.  **Construct Output:** Create the output grid which contains the selected 3x3 subgrid.
4.  **Replace non-dominant colors:** Within the sub-grid, replace all colors except the dominant one to 0.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
