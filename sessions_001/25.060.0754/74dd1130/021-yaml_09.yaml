objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0-9)

actions:
  - type: rotation
    description:  The grid appears to be rotated, but it is more complex than a normal rotation as pixels are also mirrored.
    details:  The rotation is clockwise, combined with swap, which is the core transformation.

relationships:
  - input grid: maps to output grid
  - pixel color: maintained during transformation (though positions change)
