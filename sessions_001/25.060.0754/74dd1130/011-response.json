            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and update the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly captures the core concept of swapping red and magenta pixels based on their adjacency. However, it only considers the left neighbor. The test results reveal that the swap should occur regardless of whether the red or magenta pixel is on the left or right. The current implementation is too restrictive. We need to generalize the condition to check for adjacency without specifying the order.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Results:** Carefully examine each input-output pair and the result of the provided code. Note the discrepancies.\n2.  **Generalize Condition:** Modify the natural language program to reflect the bidirectional nature of the swap.\n3. **Document:** Describe observations with YAML.\n4.  **Refine Program:** Update the natural language program.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics:**\n\nTo accurately gather metrics, I'll simulate \"code execution\" by manually inspecting the input, expected output, and the actual output from the provided code.\n\n*   **Example 1:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: 3x3 grid with a red pixel on the left and a magenta pixel on the right.\n    *   Expected Output: Magenta and Red pixels swapped\n    *   Actual Output: Matches Expected\n    *   *Metrics:*\n        *   Correct Swap: 1\n        *   Incorrect Swap: 0\n        *   Missed Swap: 0\n\n*   **Example 2:** (Correct)\n    *   Input: Similar to Example 1.\n    *   Expected: Colors swapped\n    *   Actual: Colors Swapped\n    *    *Metrics:*\n        *   Correct Swap: 1\n        *   Incorrect Swap: 0\n        *   Missed Swap: 0\n\n*   **Example 3:** (Incorrect)\n    *   Input: 5x5, Red is on right, Magenta on left\n    *   Expected Output: Red and Magenta are swapped\n    *   Actual output: No Swap.\n    *    *Metrics:*\n        *   Correct Swap: 0\n        *   Incorrect Swap: 0\n        *   Missed Swap: 1\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: pixel\n    properties:\n      color:\n        - red (2)\n        - magenta (6)\n      position:\n        - adjacent: horizontal\n    actions:\n      - swap:\n          condition: \"adjacent pixels are red and magenta\"\n          description: \"Exchange colors of adjacent red and magenta pixels.\"\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.\n2.  **Check Adjacency:** For each pixel, check if any horizontally adjacent neighbor (left or right) has a different color.\n3.  **Conditional Swap:** If the current pixel is red (2) and a horizontally adjacent neighbor is magenta (6), *or* if the current pixel is magenta (6) and a horizontally adjacent neighbor is red (2), then swap the colors of the two pixels.\n4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid.\n"
