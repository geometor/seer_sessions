**input:**
```
2 6 6
2 1 1
2 6 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A175416CED0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
6 1 6
6 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C67A7D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of colored pixels. The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the colors/pixels within the grid, specifically a rotation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color: represented by integers (0-9)

actions:
  - type: rotation
    description:  The grid appears to be rotated, but it is more complex than a normal rotation as pixels are also mirrored.
    details:  The rotation is clockwise, combined with swap, which is the core transformation.

relationships:
  - input grid: maps to output grid
  - pixel color: maintained during transformation (though positions change)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify:** Observe the 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Core Transformation:** perform a swap of the pixels around the center pixel.
    *   Top-left pixel swaps with top-right.
    *   Bottom-left pixel swaps with bottom-right.
    *   Top-middle pixel swaps with the Left-Middle pixel.
    *   Bottom-middle pixel swaps with the Right-Middle pixel.
3.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with the rearranged pixels, maintaining original colors.

In simple terms, imagine swapping the corners, and then the middle edges around the center. The center pixel does not change position.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
