Each cell in the grid contains a single digit, representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement of the grid elements, a kind of rotation or reflection, potentially combined with some element-wise operations. It doesn't appear that new colors are introduced; the output grids consist of the colors present in the input grids. The positions are changed though. I suspect either a mirroring or a rotation is the primary transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
