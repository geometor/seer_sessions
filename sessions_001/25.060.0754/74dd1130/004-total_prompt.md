**input:**
```
2 2 1
1 5 1
5 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C77AC50>

**output:**
```
2 1 5
2 5 2
1 1 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C77B550>
Okay, I'm ready to analyze this task. Here's my report on the input-output example provided:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The task involves two 3x3 grids.
*   Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color.
*   The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
*   The arrangement of colors/numbers changes between the input and output.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      type: cell
      properties:
        value: integer (0-9) # Representing color
        position: (row, column)

actions:
  - type: transformation
    description: Rearranges the positions of cell values.

relationships:
  - input_grid: output_grid (transformed)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation appears to be a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the grid.

1.  The input grid looks to be rotated.
2.  That rotation is 90 degrees.
3.  That rotation is in the clockwise direction.

In summary:

The program rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise to produce the output grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
