Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The input grids are always 3x3, and the output grids are 3x6, suggesting a replication or mirroring operation. The core operation appears to be some form of duplication of the input grid. The arrangement of colors/numbers in the input grid seems preserved in the output, with some repetition. It looks like the input grid is copied and placed below, then rotated.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions:
      input: 3x3
      output: 6x3
    elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
    properties:
        - color_distribution: varies per example

actions:
  - name: duplicate
    description: The input grid appears to be duplicated.
  - name: invert_and_duplicate
    description: The input grid appears to be inverted, and duplicated.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid is a vertically elongated version of the input grid, combining the input grid and its reverse.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Copy:** Take the original 3x3 input grid.
2.  **Reverse:** Create a copy of the 3x3 and vertically flip/mirror/reverse.
3.  **Combine:** Stack combine the original grid rows on top of the rows of the reversed version of the grid, resulting in a 6x3 output grid.
