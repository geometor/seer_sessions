The dimensions of the output grid are determined by taking the smaller of 3 and the corresponding input grid dimension. This means:\n    *   The output grid will have a maximum of 3 rows, but will use the available input rows if fewer than 3.\n    *   The output grid will have a maximum of 3 columns, but will use the available input columns if fewer than 3.\n3. **Extract Subgrid:** Copy the top-left portion of the input grid up to the sizes determined in Step 2.\n4. **Output:** The extracted subgrid becomes the output. The output grid can therefore be a maximum of 3x3 but smaller if the input dimensions are smaller.\n\nIn summary, the output is always the top-left corner of the input grid, with dimensions limited to a maximum of 3x3. The program correctly extracts the largest possible subgrid, up to 3x3, from the top-left corner of the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extracts the largest possible subgrid (up to 3x3) from the top-left corner\n    of the input grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Determine the dimensions of the subgrid.\n    rows = min(3, input_grid.shape[0])\n    cols = min(3, input_grid.shape[1])\n\n    # Extract the subgrid.\n    output_grid = input_grid[:rows, :cols].copy()\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
