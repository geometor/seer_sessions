<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x7A174C6BB9D0>

**output:**
```

4 4 8
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids are composed of colored squares (pixels), represented by single-digit numbers. The input grid appears to be divided into 3x3 subgrids, each with uniform colors. The output grid retains only the top 3x3 subgrid of the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9, 3] # input grid
      elements: colored squares (pixels)
      values: [0-9] # representing colors
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3] # output grid
      elements: colored squares (pixels)
      values: [0-9]

  - type: subgrid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3,3]
      parent: input_grid

actions:
  - type: extract
    agent: system
    target: top-left 3x3 subgrid
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid

relationships:
  - type: part_of
    subject: subgrid
    object: input_grid
  - type: corresponds_to
    subject: output_grid
    object: top_left_subgrid # of input grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the input grid:** The input is a 9x3 grid of colored pixels.
2.  **Locate the target subgrid:** The target is the 3x3 subgrid located at the top-left corner of the input grid.
3.  **Extract the subgrid:** Copy the 3x3 top-left portion of the input grid.
4.  **Create output grid:** Use the extracted subgrid as the output grid. Essentially, the output grid is a cropped version of the input grid.
In short form, it means: Crop the input grid to the first 3 rows.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
