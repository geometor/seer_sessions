**input:**
```
1 5 5
5 1 1
5 1 1
3 3 3
3 6 3
3 6 6
7 7 7
7 2 2
7 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x576 at 0x7A174C5B82D0>

**output:**
```
3 3 3
3 6 3
3 6 6
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C5BA8D0>
Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pair to understand the transformation rule. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a 9x3 grid with cells containing single-digit integers (0-9), representing colors.
*   The output is a 3x3 grid, also with cells containing single-digit integers.
*   It seems like the output is a subset of the input grid.
*   The colors in output correspond to rows 4 through 6 of input grid.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [9, 3]  # Input grid dimensions
      cells: integer values (0-9)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [3, 3]  # Output grid dimensions
      cells: integer values (0-9)

actions:
  - type: selection
    description: A sub-grid is selected from the input.
    parameters:
        start_row: 4
        end_row: 6
        start_col: 1
        end_col: 3

relationships:
  - type: subset
    description: The output grid is a subset of the input grid.
    details: Specifically, rows 4-6 of the input grid form the output grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  The program takes a 9x3 grid as input.
2.  It extracts a 3x3 sub-grid from the input.
3.  The sub-grid consists of rows 4, 5, and 6 of the input grid (using 1-based indexing).
4.   The program return extracted 3x3 sub-grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
