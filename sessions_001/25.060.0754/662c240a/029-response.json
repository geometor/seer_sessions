            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code against the provided training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code and natural language program were based on the observation of the first training example, assuming a simple extraction of a 3x3 subgrid from the top-left corner. The subsequent test results reveal that this assumption holds true for all provided training examples. There are no errors, meaning the generated code correctly transforms the input to the expected output for all training instances.\n\nSince the code works perfectly on the training set, the strategy is to maintain the core logic. The natural language program should be reinforced to reflect this consistent behavior across all examples, and the YAML block needs to accurately describe the observed objects and actions. No modifications to the underlying *logic* are required, only clarification and confirmation of the existing descriptions.\n\n**Metrics and Results**\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Expected Output Shape | Correct | Notes                                                                |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | (7, 6)      | (3, 3)       | (3, 3)               | True    | Top-left 3x3 subgrid extracted.                                    |\n| 2       | (6, 6)      | (3, 3)       | (3, 3)               | True    | Top-left 3x3 subgrid extracted.                                    |\n| 3       | (3, 3)      | (3, 3)       | (3, 3)               | True    | Top-left 3x3 subgrid extracted (input is already 3x3).              |\n| 4      | (15, 12)     | (3, 3)       | (3, 3)          | True     |Top left 3x3 subgrid extracted |\n| 5      | (5,10)    |(3,3)        |(3,3)            | True         |Top left 3x3 subgrid extracted|\n\nAll examples performed as expected.\n\n**YAML Block**\n\n```yaml\nobservations:\n  - object: input_grid\n    description: A 2D array of pixels with varying dimensions.\n    properties:\n      - rows: Variable, between 1 and 30.\n      - columns: Variable, between 1 and 30.\n      - values: Integers representing colors (0-9).\n  - object: output_grid\n    description: A 2D array of pixels, derived from the input_grid.\n    properties:\n      - rows: min(3, input_grid.rows)\n      - columns: min(3, input_grid.columns)\n      - values: Same as the corresponding pixels in the input_grid.\n  - action: extract_subgrid\n    description: A subgrid is extracted from the top-left corner of the input_grid.\n    input: input_grid\n    output: output_grid\n    parameters:\n      - max_rows: 3\n      - max_cols: 3\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\nThe transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Examine Input:** The input is a grid (2D array) of colored pixels, where each color is represented by an integer from 0 to 9.\n2.  **Determine Output Size:** The output grid will be a subgrid extracted from the top-left corner of the input grid. The dimensions of the output grid are determined by taking the smaller of 3 and the corresponding input grid dimension. This means:\n    *   The output grid will have a maximum of 3 rows, but will use the available input rows if fewer than 3.\n    *   The output grid will have a maximum of 3 columns, but will use the available input columns if fewer than 3.\n3. **Extract Subgrid:** Copy the top-left portion of the input grid up to the sizes determined in Step 2.\n4. **Output:** The extracted subgrid becomes the output. The output grid can therefore be a maximum of 3x3 but smaller if the input dimensions are smaller.\n\nIn summary, the output is always the top-left corner of the input grid, with dimensions limited to a maximum of 3x3. The program correctly extracts the largest possible subgrid, up to 3x3, from the top-left corner of the input grid.\n"
