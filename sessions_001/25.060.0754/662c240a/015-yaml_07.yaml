observations:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      rows: variable
      cols: variable
      unique_colors: variable (0, 1), (0,7), (0,4), (2)
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      rows: 3
      cols: 3
      unique_colors: corresponds to a single color present as a 3x3 block in the input grid.
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: A 3x3 subgrid is extracted from the input grid.
    parameters:
       rows: The starting row index of the sub-grid appears to be the first row of a contiguous 3x3 block of identical color.
       columns: The starting column index is consistently the 5th column. However, it seems more reasonable to consider this the start of the contiguous 3x3 block.
