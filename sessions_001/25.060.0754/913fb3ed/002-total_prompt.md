<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=2720x2128 at 0x7A1754144A50>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on elements, facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming 2D grids of colored pixels. The primary elements are:

*   **Input Grid:** A 2D array of single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors.
*   **Output Grid:** A 2D array with the same dimensions as the input grid, but with a modified arrangement of colors.
*   **Pixels:** Individual cells within the grids, each holding a single color value.
*   **Objects:** Contiguous blocks of non-zero pixels of the same color.  The examples suggest single-pixel objects are significant.
*   **Background:** The color 0 (white) appears to be the background and is generally unaffected, except where objects are created or expanded.

**YAML Fact Representation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: object_detection
    description: Identify single-pixel objects of non-zero color in the input grid.
    properties:
      - color: The color of the pixel (1-9).
      - location: (row, column) coordinates of the pixel.

  - type: transformation_rule
    description: Create a 3x3 square around each identified single-pixel object.
    properties:
       - fill_color:  If the original pixel color is 3 (green) use 6(magenta) as border, otherwise use color 1 (blue)
       - center_color: input pixel color
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Targets:** Scan the input grid and find all single pixels that have a non-zero color (i.e., not white/0). These are our target pixels.
2.  **Create Squares, part 1**: around green pixels, build a 3x3 magenta square.
3.  **Create Squares, part 2**: around every other non-zero pixel, construct a 3 x 3 blue square.
4. **Center Pixel:** The original target pixel's color remains unchanged at the center of its new square.
5.  **Background:** All other pixels in the output grid remain white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
