**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. The primary change observed is the substitution of the digit '3' (green) with the digit '8' (azure) in specific locations, while other digits and their corresponding colors remain unchanged. The substitution isn't universal; some '3's might remain. The spatial arrangement and dimensions of the grid seem to be preserved, except if we look at example three, where a green pixel stays.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
facts:
  - observation: |
      Input and output grids maintain the same dimensions.
  - object: pixels
    properties:
      value: integer (0-9)
      color: derived from value (0: white, 3: green, 8: azure)
    actions:
      change_value: |
        Some pixels with value 3 change to 8.
      stay:
        Pixels that do not change value.
    relationships:
      - spatial_relationship: adjacency (pixels next to each other)
      - change_relationship: |
          If a green(3) pixel is adjacent to any other green(3) pixel, change green(3) pixel to azure (8).
          If a green pixel is not adjacent to any other green pixel, it will not change.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each pixel in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** pixels with the value '3' (green).
3.  **Check Adjacency:** For each green pixel, examine its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, and right, but not diagonal).
4. **Conditional change:**
    *   If a green pixel has *at least one* neighboring pixel that is also green, change its value to '8' (azure).
    *    If there are no neighboring pixels, or none of the neighboring pixels is green, leave the pixel as is.
5.  **Output:** Construct the output grid with the modified pixel values, preserving the original grid structure.

Essentially, the rule appears to be: "Change green (3) to azure (8) if and only if the green pixel is adjacent to another green pixel."

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
