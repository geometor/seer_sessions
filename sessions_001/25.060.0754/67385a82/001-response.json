The primary change observed is the substitution of the digit '3' (green) with the digit '8' (azure) in specific locations, while other digits and their corresponding colors remain unchanged. The substitution isn't universal; some '3's might remain. The spatial arrangement and dimensions of the grid seem to be preserved, except if we look at example three, where a green pixel stays.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
