**Perception of Elements:**

The core element is a grid of single-digit integers, representing colors.  The transformation appears to involve *expanding* the original grid, specifically doubling its width.  The expansion isn't a simple replication, but seems to involve a mirroring or reflection of elements, with the center line serving as the point of reflection. The shape changes, but the objects are preserved, duplicated on opposite sides of an invisible axis that runs down the middle.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 3x3 (input), 3x6 (output)
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) representing colors
      - structure: 2D array

actions:
  - type: expansion
    description: The width of the grid is doubled.
  - type: reflection (or mirroring)
    description:  Elements appear to be reflected across a vertical axis in the center of the expanded grid.

relationships:
  - input grid is transformed into output grid
  - output grid width = 2 * input grid width
  - output grid height = input grid height
  - Elements on the left side of input are mirrored to right side of output with input columns[n] = output column[n] and input column [n] = output column[width -1 - n]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Get Dimensions:** Obtain the width and height of the input grid.
2.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid with the same height as the input, but double the width.
3.  **Mirror:** Iterate through each cell of original input. For each cell at original input grid location of \[row, col], copy the value to the output grid at \[row, col] and also to output grid at location \[row, width - 1 - col].

Essentially, the transformation doubles the width of the grid and mirrors the original input onto the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
