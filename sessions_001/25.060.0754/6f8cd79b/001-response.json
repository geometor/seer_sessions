The output grid's dimensions are the same or different as the input grid's dimensions. The key seems to be the creation of an \"outer frame\" or border of a specific color. It expands the size by one row above, one row below, and the required additional center rows depending on height.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
