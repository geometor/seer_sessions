Previous Code:
```python
"""
1. **Reverse Input Columns:** The order of colors in the first row of the output grid corresponds to the reverse order of columns in the input grid.
2. **Position Mapping:** The colors in the input grid are mapped to the top row (row 0) of the output grid. Specifically, input column `i` maps to output column `3 - i`.
3. **Vertical Expansion:**
      - The color in the last row of input will occupy the entire column in the output.
      - All colors except in last row is copied to the same column, down to row index equal to the initial row + 1 in the input.
4. **Fill with Zero:** All remaining cells in the output grid are filled with the color 0 (white).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
