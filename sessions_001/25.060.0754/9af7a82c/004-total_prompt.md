**input:**
```
2 2 1
2 3 1
1 1 1
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A174C67A350>

**output:**
```
1 2 3
1 2 0
1 2 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x320 at 0x7A174C67A5D0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid (appears to be 3x3) into a larger, differently shaped grid (appears to be 5x3). The input grid contains single-digit integers, each corresponding to a color. The output grid also contains single-digit integers, and while some seem related to the input, others are 0, representing white. The spatial relationship between the input and output seems very important. It looks like columns are being mapped and potentially expanded.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: single-digit integers (colors)
  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 5x3
    elements: single-digit integers (colors)
  - type: relationship
    description: column mapping
    details: input columns seem to map to output columns, with potential expansion or replication.
  - type: observation
    details: input grid's first column (blue,red, blue) becomes a full column (all blue) in the output grid's first column
  - type: observation
    details: input grid's second column (red, green, blue) becomes a taller column in output (red,red,red,white,white)
  - type: observation
    details: The third input column (blue, blue, blue) has become a shorter column in the ouput (green,white,white)
  - type: colors:
      details: The colors are represented by the numbers, mapping not known without more context.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Column Mapping:** The input grid's columns are mapped to columns in the output grid, but not 1:1.
2. **First Column:** The input's first column maps to the ouput's first column. All output elements are set to the value of the first element in the input.
3.  **Second Column:** The input's second column maps to output's second column. The output's first three elements are set to the value of the first element of the input column. The rest of the output column is set to 0.
4. **Third Column:** The Input's third column maps to the output's third column. The output's first element gets the value of the first input element. All other output elements in the column are set to 0.

In essence, the program extracts the first element of each input column and uses it to selectively populate the output grid's corresponding column, with specific rules about expansion and filling with zeros.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
