Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program copies the input grid to the output. Then, it iterates through specific color values (7, 8, 6, 1 in that order) to potentially append rows.  For each of these colors, it checks each column. If the color exists in the column, a new row is appended to the output.  This new row is filled with zeros, except for the current column index, where the value is set to the color being checked. The rows are added in order 7, 8, 6, and 1.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # change output pixels
    colors_to_check = [7, 8, 6, 1]
    for color in colors_to_check:
        for col in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if color in input_grid[:, col]:
                new_row = np.zeros(input_grid.shape[1], dtype=int)
                new_row[col] = color

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
