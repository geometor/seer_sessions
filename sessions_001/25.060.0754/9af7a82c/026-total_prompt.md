Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program copies the input grid to the output. Then, it iterates through specific color values (7, 8, 6, 1 in that order) to potentially append rows.  For each of these colors, it checks each column. If the color exists in the column, a new row is appended to the output.  This new row is filled with zeros, except for the current column index, where the value is set to the color being checked. The rows are added in order 7, 8, 6, and 1.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = input_grid.copy()

    # change output pixels
    colors_to_check = [7, 8, 6, 1]
    for color in colors_to_check:
        for col in range(input_grid.shape[1]):
            if color in input_grid[:, col]:
                new_row = np.zeros(input_grid.shape[1], dtype=int)
                new_row[col] = color
                output_grid = np.vstack([output_grid, new_row])

    return output_grid.tolist()
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code were based on the first training example. The core idea of appending rows based on the presence of specific colors in columns is partially correct. However, the subsequent examples reveal that this rule needs refinement. The generated code correctly handles the first example, but fails on the others. This indicates that some aspects of the transformation are not captured. The strategy will involve:

1.  **Detailed Examination:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting the presence, absence, and position of colors, and comparing the differences between the input and output.
2.  **Object Identification:** Identify what constitutes an "object" in this context. It seems to be related to columns and specific colors.
3.  **Rule Refinement:** Modify the natural language program to accurately describe the conditions under which new rows are added and what values they contain. The order of colors (7, 8, 6, 1) seems significant and should be preserved.
4. **YAML documentation** Collect facts into YAML, and make sure we include object definitions and their properties.

**Metrics and Observations**

I will gather information about each of the training examples.
- **Example 1**: The original example, and the code works
- **Example 2**:  
    - Input grid size: 3x5.
    - Colors present in the input: 0, 7, 8, 6, 1.
    - Output: input grid + four new rows
- **Example 3**:
    - Input grid size: 6x5.
    - Output: input grid + four new rows

Here's a breakdown of each training example:

**Example 1 (Correct):**

*   Input: 3x3, contains colors 7, 8, 6, and 1 in various columns.
*   Output: 3x3 input grid + four new rows. Each new row corresponds to one of the colors 7, 8, 6, and 1, and has that color in the column where it first appeared in the input.

**Example 2 (Incorrect):**

*   Input: 3x5, contains colors 7, 8, 6, and 1, distributed across columns.
*   Expected Output: Similar logic to example 1, with rows added for colors 7, 8, 6, and 1.
* code output: incorrect because adds rows for colors that exist anywhere in the column - needs to be the *first* occurence

**Example 3 (Incorrect):**

*   Input: 6x5.
*   Expected output: Similar logic to example 1, with rows added for colors 7, 8, 6, and 1.
* code output: incorrect because adds rows for colors that exist anywhere in the column - needs to be the *first* occurence

**YAML Documentation**

```yaml
task: 98cf4a1f
objects:
  grid:
    description: A 2D array of color values.
    properties:
      rows: Number of rows in the grid.
      columns: Number of columns in the grid.
      colors: A set of unique color values present in the grid.
  target_colors:
    description: a set of colors that will trigger actions
    properties:
      colors: [7, 8, 6, 1] # Orange, Azure, Magenta, Blue
      order: The order in which to check

actions:
  append_row:
    description: Adds a new row to the output grid.
    properties:
      color: The color value to be placed in the new row.
      column_index: The column index where the color value should be placed. The column index corresponds to where target_color *first appears* in the column.
      row_values: all zeros, except color value at column_index

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Copy Input:** Begin by copying the input grid to the output grid.
2.  **Iterate Colors:** For each color in the sequence 7 (orange), 8 (azure), 6 (magenta), and 1 (blue), do the following:
3.  **Check Columns:** Iterate through each column of the *input* grid.
4.  **First Occurrence**: Find the *first* row index where the current color appears in the current column.
5. **Append if found**:
    - If the target color is found, create a new row with the same width as the input grid.
        - Initialize all cells in this new row to 0 (white).
        - Set the cell at the index equal to the current column number to the target color.
    - Append the new row to the *output* grid.

The critical update here is the "first occurrence" condition. The original program only checked for the *presence* of a color in a column, which is insufficient. The new program specifically looks for the first instance of each target color within each column, which aligns better with all training examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
