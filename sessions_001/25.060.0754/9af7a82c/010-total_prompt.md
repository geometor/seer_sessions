**input:**
```
3 1 1 4
2 2 2 4
4 4 4 4
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=256x192 at 0x7A174C74D150>

**output:**
```
4 2 1 3
4 2 1 0
4 2 0 0
4 0 0 0
4 0 0 0
4 0 0 0
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a small grid of colored squares (represented by numbers) into a larger grid. The colors in the input grid seem to be mapped to specific positions in the output grid, and a filling pattern is applied, expanding downwards. The color white (0) appears to be a background or filler color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    description: input grid
    dimensions: 3x4
    elements:
      - color: 3 (green)
        position: [0,0]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: [0,1]
      - color: 1 (blue)
        position: [0,2]
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        position: [0,3]
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: [1,0]
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: [1,1]
      - color: 2 (red)
        position: [1,2]
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        position: [1,3]
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        position: [2,0]
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        position: [2,1]
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        position: [2,2]
      - color: 4 (yellow)
        position: [2,3]

  - type: grid
    description: output grid
    dimensions: 6x4
    elements:
      - description: mapping from input grid, with vertical expansion and filling with 0.
      - observation: "Colors from the input are placed in the top row of the output in reverse order of their original columns."
      - observation: "Each input color expands downwards in its output column. Yellow extends for the full output height; other colors for height = the original row index + 1."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Reverse Input Columns:** The order of colors in the first row of the output grid corresponds to the reverse order of columns in the input grid.
2. **Position Mapping:** The colors in the input grid are mapped to the top row (row 0) of the output grid. Specifically, input column `i` maps to output column `3 - i`.
3. **Vertical Expansion:**
      - The color in the last row of input will occupy the entire column in the output.
      - All colors except in last row is copied to the same column, down to row index equal to the initial row + 1 in the input.
4. **Fill with Zero:** All remaining cells in the output grid are filled with the color 0 (white).

Essentially, the program takes each color from the input grid, places it in the reversed column order on the first row of the output, then expands specific color downwards before filling the rest with 0.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
