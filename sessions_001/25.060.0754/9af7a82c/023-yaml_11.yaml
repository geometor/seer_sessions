observations:
  - example_1:
      input_shape: (3, 3)
      output_shape: (5, 3)
      input_colors: [5, 8]
      output_colors: [0, 5, 8]
      transformation: |
        The input grid is copied to the output.
        Then, rows are appended based on columns containing an '8'. 
        Specifically, for each column: check if the maximum value is equal to 8. 
        If true, get the index of that maximum value in the input column.
        Append to the output grid that many rows, filled with zeros and at index of that column,
        place the value 8.

  - example_2:
      input_shape: (2, 3)
      output_shape: (3, 3)
      input_colors: [6, 8]
      output_colors: [0, 6, 8]
      transformation: |
        The input grid is copied to the output.
        Then, one row is added.
        The additional row is filled with zeros, except on index 1, it contains the value 8.

  - example_3:
      input_shape: (4, 5)
      output_shape: (6, 5)
      input_colors: [3, 7]
      output_colors: [0, 3, 7]
      transformation: |
        The input is copied to the output.
        Then for each '7' present in the input grid:
        find the index of its last occurrence in that column.
        Append rows filled with zero, and set to 7 the value at the index of the column.
        
  - example_4:
      input_shape: (2, 5)
      output_shape: (4, 5)
      input_colors: [1, 2, 6, 8]
      output_colors: [0, 1, 2, 6, 8]
      transformation: |
        The input is copied to the output.
        For each column:
        If it exists at least a 6, a new row is added at the bottom, filled with zeros, except for that column index (which becomes 6).
        If it exists at least a 1, and a row related to 6 has not already been appended, a new row is added at the bottom, filled with zeros, except for that column index (which becomes 1).
