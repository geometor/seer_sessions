Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two primary objects, distinguishable by their colors: red (2) and blue (1). There are also instances of white (0) pixels. The input grid is divided roughly in half, with red pixels on the left and blue pixels on the right.  The transformation seems to involve changing some red pixels to white based on the position of white pixels in the input.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - color: red
    value: 2
    initial_location: Left half of the grid
  - color: blue
    value: 1
    initial_location: Right half of the grid
  - color: white
    value: 0
    initial_location: Scattered, within the red and blue regions

actions:
  - type: color_change
    subject: red pixels
    new_color: white
    condition: "If a red pixel is in the same row as a white pixel and is to the left of that white pixel in the input, it becomes white. Also, all red pixels in the same column as a white cell become white."

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Red and blue regions are separated, with red on the left and blue on the right."
  - type: conditional_change
    description: "Red pixels change to white based on horizontal and vertical proximity to white pixels, maintaining column position."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** The grid is conceptually divided into two main regions: a red region (left) and a blue region (right).

2.  **Locate White Pixels:** Find all white pixels (value 0) in the *input* grid.

3. **Horizontal Transformation (Row-Based):**
    *   For each row containing a white pixel in the *input* grid:
        * change to white all red colored pixels to the left of the white cell.

4.  **Vertical Transformation (Column-Based):**
      *  For each column containing a white pixel, change every red pixel in that column to white.

5.  **Blue Region Unchanged.** The blue region is unchanged by the process.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
