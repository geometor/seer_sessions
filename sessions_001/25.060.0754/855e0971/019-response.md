Okay, let's analyze the results of the previous code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, focusing on identifying objects, finding white pixels, and using them as a replication factor. However, the results across the training examples reveal some inconsistencies and limitations:

*   **Example 0:** Perfect match. The initial logic correctly handled this case.
*   **Example 1:** Mismatch. It seems the replication logic isn't universally applicable.
*   **Example 2:** Mismatch. The replication mechanism is incorrect, shows that rows without white should also replicate based on the number of white pixels
* **Example 3:** Mismatch. The replication mechanism is incorrect, shows that rows without white should also replicate based on the number of white pixels.

The core issue seems to be that the replication logic is too narrowly focused on *only* rows containing white pixels. Other rows within an object also need to be replicated based on the count of white pixels *within that object*.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Object Identification:** The `find_objects` function seems robust, so we'll keep it.
2.  **Correct Replication Logic:** We need to modify the replication mechanism to replicate *all* rows of an object based on the number of white pixels within that object, not just the rows that contain white pixels.
3.  **Maintain Row Order:** Ensure the original order of rows within each object is preserved during replication. The existing code uses a set to remember what rows have already been processed, but this method should account for all rows in the objects.
4.  **YAML and NL Program:** We'll carefully document the refined logic in both YAML and natural language formats.

**YAML Documentation:**

```yaml
task_description: |
  The task involves replicating rows of objects within a grid based on the number of white pixels present in each object.  Each object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color. The replication factor for an object is determined by counting the white pixels within that object.  All rows belonging to an object, are replicated by the replication factor.  The original order of rows within each object and the order of objects is maintained in the output.

object_properties:
  - name: object
    definition: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    attributes:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the object.
      - white_pixel_count: The number of white (0) pixels within the object.
      - rows: A list of rows that constitute object.
      - replication_factor: determined by the number of white pixels

actions:
  - name: replicate_rows
    description: Replicates all rows of each object.
    input: object
    process: |
      1. Determine the replication factor for the object (white_pixel_count).
      2. For each row in object.rows: append the row to a new list 'replication_factor' times.
    output: modified object rows
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Divide the input grid into distinct objects. An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
2.  **Count White Pixels:** For each object, count the number of white pixels. This count is the "replication factor" for that object.
3.  **Replicate All Object Rows:** For each object, replicate *all* of its rows. The number of times each row is replicated is equal to the object's replication factor (the white pixel count).
4.  **Construct Output:** Combine the replicated rows of all objects, preserving the original order of objects and the order of rows within each object, to form the final output grid.
