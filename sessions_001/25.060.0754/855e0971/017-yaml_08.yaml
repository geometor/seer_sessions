facts:
  - observation: |
      The initial assumption that the replication factor is the total number of white pixels is incorrect.
  - observation: |
      Objects/regions are important for determining replication.
  - object_definition: |
      An object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
  - replication_rule: |
      Rows containing white pixels are replicated.
  - replication_factor: |
      The replication factor for a row is determined by the number of white pixels within the object that contains the white pixel in that row.
  - scope: |
      Replication only affects the object the white pixel is in.
