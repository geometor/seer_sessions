Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example, focusing on perception, object identification, and the transformation rule:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are grids of digits, representing colored pixels. There are distinct regions of red (2), grey (5), yellow (4), and white (0). The primary change seems to be related to the location of the white pixels within the grid, and a potential interaction between different colored regions.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - id: red_region
    color: red (2)
    property: static_left_border
    initial_shape: rectangle
  - id: grey_region
    color: grey (5)
    property: static_middle_border
    initial_shape: rectangle
  - id: yellow_region
    color: yellow (4)
    property: static_right_border
    initial_shape: rectangle
  - id: white_pixels
    color: white (0)
    property: dynamic, moves, disappears,reappears
    initial_locations: variable, within grey and yellow regions

actions:
  - name: move_white_pixels
    actor: white_pixels
    precondition: white pixels exist within the larger rectangular colored object
    postcondition: white pixels move or disappear if some condition is met, new one generated
  - name: propagation
    actor: white_pixels
    precondition: original region of the white pixel
    postcondition: if from yellow, stay, if from grey, propagate to red section

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    between: red_region, grey_region, yellow_region, white_pixels
  - type: containment
    between: colored Regions, white_pixels

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Regions:** The input grid is divided into three vertical rectangular regions: red (left), grey (middle), and yellow (right).

2.  **Locate White Pixels:** Identify all white (0) pixels within the grey and yellow regions.

3.  **Apply Transformation Rule:**
    *   If a white pixel is in the yellow region, it remains in its original position.
    *   If a white pixel is in the grey region, propagate a white pixel on the same row of the red region

4. **Output:** produce the new grid after applying the transformation

In simpler terms, white pixels from the grey region, create white pixels in the same row, on the red region, those from the yellow one stay where they are.
