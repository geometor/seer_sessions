There are three distinct horizontal bands of color: azure (8) at the top, red (2) in the middle, and green (3) at the bottom. Within each band, there's a single white (0) pixel. The transformation seems to replicate each row containing a white pixel multiple times.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Note the row index of each white pixel.\n\n3. **Determine number of white pixels** Determine how many times each colored section has a white square in it's area\n\n4.  **Replicate Rows:** For each row containing a white pixel: make copies of the row, and place them directly below the original row. The final count for each row with a white pixel in it, should be the same as the number of white pixels in the grid.\n\nIn summary, the input is a grid divided in three horizontal colored sections. Within each colored section, there is a white pixel. We replicate the rows containing white pixels so that for each original row with a white pixel, there are *n* rows in the output, where *n* is the number of white pixels in the input.\n"
