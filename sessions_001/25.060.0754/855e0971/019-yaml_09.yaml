task_description: |
  The task involves replicating rows of objects within a grid based on the number of white pixels present in each object.  Each object is a contiguous block of pixels of the same color. The replication factor for an object is determined by counting the white pixels within that object.  All rows belonging to an object, are replicated by the replication factor.  The original order of rows within each object and the order of objects is maintained in the output.

object_properties:
  - name: object
    definition: A contiguous block of pixels of the same color.
    attributes:
      - color: The color of the pixels in the object.
      - white_pixel_count: The number of white (0) pixels within the object.
      - rows: A list of rows that constitute object.
      - replication_factor: determined by the number of white pixels

actions:
  - name: replicate_rows
    description: Replicates all rows of each object.
    input: object
    process: |
      1. Determine the replication factor for the object (white_pixel_count).
      2. For each row in object.rows: append the row to a new list 'replication_factor' times.
    output: modified object rows
