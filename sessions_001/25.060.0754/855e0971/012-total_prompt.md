Previous Code:
```python
"""
The grid is divided into two regions: red (left) and blue (right). White pixels are present in both regions.
For each row containing a white pixel, all red pixels to the left of the white pixel in that row are changed to white.
For each column containing a white pixel, all red pixels in that column become white. The blue region remains unchanged.

    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were on the right track, identifying the presence of white pixels and their effect on red pixels. However, the initial program was incomplete. It correctly identified that white pixels cause some red pixels to their left to become white. The initial program failed to consider the right-most white pixel as a boundary and changed *all* red pixels in the same row to white. It also incorrectly assumed a column-wise transformation mirroring the row-wise behavior.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** I will examine each input-output pair, noting the precise location of white pixels and the resulting changes in red pixels. I'll pay close attention to the boundary conditions (edges of the grid, other colored pixels).

2.  **Refine Observations:** Based on the analysis, I will update the observations in a structured YAML format, focusing on object properties (color, position) and actions (change color).

3.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** I will rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the observed transformation, incorporating the boundary condition.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

To accurately assess the transformation, I'll use a simple function to describe the locations of white and the state of red pixels.

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_grid(grid):
    """Analyzes the grid for white and red pixel positions and states."""
    white_pixels = []
    red_pixels_before = []
    red_pixels_after = []

    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r, c] == 0:
                white_pixels.append((r, c))
            elif grid[r,c] == 2:
                red_pixels_before.append((r,c))

    return {
        "white_pixels": white_pixels,
        "red_pixels_before": red_pixels_before,

    }

def compare_io(input, output):
    input_analysis = analyze_grid(input)
    output_analysis = analyze_grid(output)

    print("Input:")
    print(input)
    print(f"  White Pixels: {input_analysis['white_pixels']}")
    print(f"  Red Pixels  : {input_analysis['red_pixels_before']}")
    print("Output:")
    print(output)
    print(f"  White Pixels: {output_analysis['white_pixels']}")
    print(f"  Red Pixels  : {output_analysis['red_pixels_before']}")

    return

#Example Usage (substitute with actual input/output grids later)

#input_grid = np.array([[1,0], [2,3]])
#output_grid = np.array([[0,0],[0,3]])
#compare_io(input_grid, output_grid)

```

Now, let's perform the analysis for each of the example pairs, using the code I just prepared:

```python

]

for input_grid, output_grid in examples:
    compare_io(input_grid, output_grid)
    print("-" * 20)

```

**YAML Observations:**

```yaml
observations:
  - object: Red Pixels
    property: color=red (2)
    action: Change to white (0) conditionally.
  - object: White Pixels
    property: color=white (0)
    action: Act as a boundary for the red pixel transformation.
  - condition: "row_contains_white"
    description: "If a row contains a white pixel..."
  - transformation_rule: |
      For each row, find the right-most white pixel. 
      Change all red pixels to the left of this white pixel in that row to white.
  - boundary: Right-most white pixel in each row.
  - context: 2D Grid of pixels, colors 0-9
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is transformed as follows: For each row in the grid, identify the right-most white pixel. If a row contains one or more white pixels, change all red pixels to the left of that row's right-most white pixel to white. If a row does not contain any white pixels, no changes are made to that row. The colors of non-red and non-white pixels are not changed, nor does any change occur based on columns.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
