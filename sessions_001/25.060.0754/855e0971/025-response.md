Here's an analysis of the provided code, results, and a plan for improvement:

**General Assessment:**

The initial natural language program and the resulting code were a good first attempt, capturing the core idea of mirroring white pixels across a grey-red boundary. However, the code fails on several examples. The issue isn't the overall concept, but the specific details of *how* the mirroring is implemented, and assumptions made about boundaries. Specifically, the assumptions include that any red and grey regions have a boundary and the boundary should be used to find the relative positions.

**Strategy for Resolving Errors:**

1.  **Refine Boundary Detection:** The current `find_boundary` function assumes *any* pair of grey and red regions have a relevant boundary. This is incorrect. We need to ensure we're only considering boundaries between grey and red regions that are actually related to the transformation. It might not be a matter of *all* boundaries, but a specific, single boundary.

2.  **Improve Relative Position Calculation:** The current relative position calculation is overly simplistic and doesn't guarantee a correct "mirroring" effect.

3. **Re-evaluate Region Selection**: It seems like we are operating over all gray regions and all red regions, there is no selection for the relevant regions in the program.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

I will use a simplified representation of the grids, focusing on the relevant parts (grey, red, and white areas). I'll manually inspect, since I can't execute code directly in this turn.

*   **Example 1 (Correct):** The code works as expected.
*   **Example 2 (Incorrect):**
    Input grid:
    ```
    5 5 5 5 5 5 5
    5 5 5 5 5 5 5
    5 5 5 0 5 5 5
    5 5 0 0 0 5 5
    5 0 0 0 0 0 5
    2 2 2 2 2 2 2
    2 2 2 2 2 2 2
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    5 5 5 5 5 5 5
    5 5 5 5 5 5 5
    5 5 5 0 5 5 5
    5 5 0 0 0 5 5
    5 0 0 0 0 0 5
    2 2 2 0 2 2 2
    2 2 0 0 0 2 2
    ```

    Actual output:
    ```
    5 5 5 5 5 5 5
    5 5 5 5 5 5 5
    5 5 5 0 5 5 5
    5 5 0 0 0 5 5
    5 0 0 0 0 0 5
    2 2 2 0 2 2 2
    2 2 0 0 0 2 2
    ```

*   **Example 3 (Incorrect):**

The code is incorrectly transferring white pixels.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
objects:
  - name: grey_region
    color: 5
    properties:
      - contiguous
      - contains_white_pixels
  - name: red_region
    color: 2
    properties:
      - contiguous
  - name: white_pixels_in_grey
    color: 0
    properties:
      - located_within: grey_region
  - name: boundary
    properties:
      - between: grey_region, red_region
      - type: adjacent # (up, down, left, right)

actions:
  - name: transfer_color
    source: white_pixels_in_grey
    target: red_region
    mechanism: mirroring_across_boundary
    condition: boundary_exists
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the relevant Grey and Red Regions:** Find the single contiguous grey region and the single contiguous red region that are involved in the transformation. These regions *must* share a direct boundary (adjacent pixels, not diagonal).
2.  **Identify White Pixels within Grey:** Locate all white pixels (0) contained *within* the identified grey region.
3.  **Mirror Across Boundary:** For each white pixel in the grey region:
    *   Find the *closest* grey pixel that is part of the grey-red boundary.
    *   Find the corresponding red pixel on the other side of that boundary point.
    *    Calculate the relative position vector between the white pixel and the grey boundary pixel.
    *   Apply this same relative position vector, starting from the corresponding *red* boundary pixel, to find the target pixel in the red region.
    *   Change the color of the target pixel in the red region to white (0), *if* the target pixel is within the bounds of the grid and is currently red.
4. Regions which do not have adjacent boundaries should remain unchanged.
