Here's my report:\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   The input and output are grids of digits, representing colors.\n*   There's a prominent horizontal line of 5s (gray) in both input and output, dividing each grid into two parts.\n*   Many digits above and below this line are replaced with 0s (white) in the output.\n*    Specifically the digits that change are not 5\n*   The transformation seems to involve removing or blanking out certain digits/colors based on their position relative to the gray line and their value.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
