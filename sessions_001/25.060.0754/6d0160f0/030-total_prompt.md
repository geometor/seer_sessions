Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all gray pixels (value 5) in the input grid. These act as horizontal and vertical separators, dividing the grid into segments.

2.  **Segment Iteration**: Iterate through each horizontal segment defined by the horizontal gray separators, from top to bottom.

3.  **Vertical Segment Processing:** Within each horizontal segment, iterate through the vertical segments defined by the vertical gray lines.

4.  **Extract and Copy Colors:** For each segment (defined by both horizontal and vertical separators):
    *   Find all unique, non-zero, non-gray colors within the segment, recording the location of the color's first appearance (top to bottom, left to right).
    *   Copy these unique colors to the row *immediately below the current horizontal segment's lower boundary*. Maintain the original column position of the first occurance.
    *   If the target location is occupied by a gray pixel, keep the gray pixel.

5.  **Preserve Separators:** Ensure all gray separators from the input grid are present in the output grid at their original positions.

6.  **Clear Remaining Pixels:** All pixels in a segment, other than the copied colors and gray separators, should be set to white (0).

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of the initial code execution and refine our natural language program and approach.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code performs reasonably well on the first example, which it was primarily based on. However, the results on the subsequent examples reveal several shortcomings:

1.  **Incorrect Copying Logic**: The current code copies the first instance of *every* unique non-gray, non-zero color within a segment to the row immediately below the horizontal separator. It does not consider all of the segments below the separator.
2.  **Missing Segments**: The core logic is only considering segments to the *right* of vertical separators and immediately *below* horizontal separators, which isn't how all examples behave. Some of them require colors to travel multiple rows below.
3.  **Overwriting**: There's a potential issue that must be avoided: a gray pixel may be overwritten, which must not happen.
4. **Missing Segments**: Vertical segments before the first vertical separator are not considered.

**Strategy for Improvement**

1.  **Generalized Segment Definition:** Instead of treating horizontal and vertical separators differently, create a function to define *all* segments based on *both* horizontal and vertical gray lines.  This will involve finding all combinations of horizontal and vertical separator pairs.
2.  **Flexible Copy Destination:** Modify the copying logic to find all segments that have a horizontal separator that defines the source segment, and copy colors appropriately.
3. **Correct First Occurrence**: Ensure we're copying only the first occurrence. The previous code's logic was not consistent.
4. **Preserve Gray Separators**: Explicitly check to avoid overwriting gray pixels during the copy operation.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

Let's examine each example pair and the code's output. I'll use numpy to compare the expected output with the produced output and pinpoint specific errors.

```python
import numpy as np

def compare_grids(expected, produced):
    """Compares two grids and returns a detailed report."""
    if expected.shape != produced.shape:
        return "Shapes are different"
    diff = expected != produced
    diff_indices = np.where(diff)
    num_diffs = len(diff_indices[0])
    report = {
        "total_differences": num_diffs,
        "different_pixels": [],
    }
    for i in range(num_diffs):
        row = diff_indices[0][i]
        col = diff_indices[1][i]
        report["different_pixels"].append(
            {
                "row": row,
                "col": col,
                "expected": int(expected[row, col]),
                "produced": int(produced[row, col]),
            }
        )
    return report

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find Separators**: Identify all gray pixels (value 5) in the input grid. These act as horizontal and vertical separators.

2.  **Define All Segments**: Create a list of all rectangular segments defined by all combinations of adjacent horizontal and vertical separators.  A segment is defined by its top-left and bottom-right corner coordinates.

3.  **Iterate Through Segments**: For each segment in the list, from top to bottom and left to right:
    *   Find the unique, non-zero, non-gray colors within the segment, recording the location (row, column) of the *first* appearance of each color (scanning top to bottom, then left to right).

4.  **Iterate through horizontal separators** For each horizontal separator, find the associated segments.

5.  **Copy Colors**: For each color found in a source segment, copy the color to the row *immediately below* the horizontal separator line that defines the lower boundary of the segment.
    *   Maintain the *original column* of the color's first appearance within the source segment.
    *   *Do not* overwrite gray pixels (value 5) in the destination row. If the target cell is gray, skip the copy for that cell.

6.  **Preserve Separators:** All gray separator pixels from the input grid must be present in the output grid at their original positions.

7.  **Clear Remnants:** After copying colors, all pixels in each segment that don't contain the copied colors or the gray separators, should be set to white color(value=0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution
