Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation preserves all horizontally contiguous sequences of gray (5) pixels and converts all other pixels to white (0).
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, filled with 0s.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape

    # Iterate through each row and column of the input grid.
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            # Check if the current pixel is gray (5).
            if input_grid[r, c] == 5:
                # If it's a 5, preserve it in the output grid.
                output_grid[r, c] = 5
            # else the output grid is already initialized to 0 so do nothing

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
