Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Separators:** Find all gray pixels (value 5) in the input grid. These act as horizontal and vertical separators, dividing the grid into segments.

2.  **Segment Iteration**: Iterate through each horizontal segment defined by the horizontal gray separators, from top to bottom.

3.  **Vertical Segment Processing:** Within each horizontal segment, iterate through the vertical segments defined by the vertical gray lines.

4.  **Extract and Copy Colors:** For each segment (defined by both horizontal and vertical separators):
    *   Find all unique, non-zero, non-gray colors within the segment, recording the location of the color's first appearance (top to bottom, left to right).
    *   Copy these unique colors to the row *immediately below the current horizontal segment's lower boundary*. Maintain the original column position of the first occurance.
    *   If the target location is occupied by a gray pixel, keep the gray pixel.

5.  **Preserve Separators:** Ensure all gray separators from the input grid are present in the output grid at their original positions.

6.  **Clear Remaining Pixels:** All pixels in a segment, other than the copied colors and gray separators, should be set to white (0).

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
