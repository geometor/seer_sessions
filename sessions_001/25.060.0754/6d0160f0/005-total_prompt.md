Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Locate the two horizontal lines composed entirely of '5' (grey) pixels. These lines divide the input grid into three distinct sections (top, middle, and bottom).  If there's only one grey line, it's treated as if there are two, with either the top or bottom section being empty.

2.  **Process Each Section Independently:** For each of the three sections:
    *   Iterate through each row within the section.
    *   All output grid pixels that are `5` in the input grid, should be `5`
    *   Identify non-'0' and non-'5' pixels in the input row of the section.
    *   Moving from left to right within each *row*, transfer any non-'0' and non-'5' values in the Input section to the first available '0' position in the Output section within that same *row*.

3.  **Combine Sections:** The output grid is formed by combining the processed top, middle, and bottom sections, maintaining the '5' (grey) separator lines in their original positions. If a grey line is at the very top or bottom, the section above or below is considered empty and remains all zeros.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
