Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** Both input and output are 11x11 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of various colors, represented by digits 0-9.
*   **Dominant Color:** Gray (5) appears to be a significant element, forming horizontal lines.
*   **Sparsity:**  Many cells are white (0).
*   **Change Focus:** The transformation seems to mostly remove certain colored pixels, leaving behind white pixels and the gray lines, while a subset of original colors is retained in specific positions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 11x11
    input_colors: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
    output_colors: [0, 4, 5, 7, 9]
    dominant_color: 5
    dominant_color_structure: horizontal_lines
    change_type: removal
    preserved_colors_positions:
        - color: 9
          input_row: 8
          input_col: 10
          output_row: 4
          output_col: 10
        - color: 4
          input_row: 9
          input_col: 8
          output_row: 5
          output_col: 10
        - color: 7
          input_row: 10
          input_col: 4
          output_row: 6
          input_col: 8

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Gray Lines:** Locate the two horizontal lines of gray (5) pixels. These lines remain unchanged.
2.  **Isolate Other Colors:** All colors other than gray (5) and white (0) are considered for potential removal.
3.  **Conditional Removal:**
    *   Most non-gray and non-white pixels are replaced with white (0).
    *   The transformation to columns can be summarized as follows:
        keep non-gray and non-white pixel from columns with a color other than grey and white.

4.  **Output:** Create a new grid with the gray lines preserved, select colors as described in step 3, and all other pixels set to white (0).

In other words, the gray lines stay the same. The columns where there was a non-gray and non-white pixel, are replaced by a white pixel in all rows except for row 4, 5, and six where the colored pixel is kept.
