Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Separators:** Locate all pixels with the color gray (5).
2.  **Preserve Separators:** Maintain the gray pixels in their original positions in the output grid.
3.  Within the two horizontal gray lines, locate the positions of any colors in the top most segment
4.  If any color exists in that segment between two vertical gray lines, maintain the first occurence of each unique non zero color just below the horizontal divider
5.  **Replace other colors:** Replace all other colored pixels that do not meet the previous condition with white color (0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
