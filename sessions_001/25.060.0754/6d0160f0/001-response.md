Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to discern the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids of single-digit integers (0-9), representing different colors. There are consistent horizontal lines of '5' (grey) in all input grids, dividing the grids into three sections. Within each section, non-grey pixels appear to be "filtered" or "masked" in some way, leaving only grey and white pixels. Also, it seems some pixels are shifted to adjacent places in their rows.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 11x11
      - cell_values: integers (0-9)
      - color_map: standard ARC color map
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      - color: integer (0-9)
      - position: (row, column)
  - type: horizontal_line
    properties:
      - color: 5 (grey)
      - position: row index

actions:
  - name: filter_pixels
    description: Retain only '5' (grey) pixels, and selected non-grey. Change other to '0' (white).
  - name: shift_pixels
     description: Within each row, non-grey pixels can shift positions, but stay inside their own area.

relationships:
  - horizontal_lines_divide_grid: The grid is divided into three sections by two horizontal lines of '5's.
  - pixel_filtering_within_sections: Filtering and shifting occurs independently within each section.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Horizontal Lines:** Locate the two horizontal lines composed entirely of '5' (grey) pixels. These lines divide the input grid into three distinct sections (top, middle, and bottom).
2.  **Process Each Section Independently:** For each of the three sections:
    *   Iterate through each row within the section.
    *   Copy all '5' pixels from the Input to the Output
    *   Identify non-'0' and non-'5' pixels in the input row of the section.
    *   Moving from left to right, check input rows. If a value different than `0` and `5` exists in the input, then fill it with the value `0`. If it exists, copy them, one by one, to the `0` valued cells in the corresponding output row.
3.  **Combine Sections:** The output grid is formed by combining the processed top, middle, and bottom sections, maintaining the '5' (grey) separator lines in their original positions.

In summary, the transformation preserves the grey lines, clears most of the other pixels to white, but preserves a selected few, shifting them to the rightmost part of each row segment.
