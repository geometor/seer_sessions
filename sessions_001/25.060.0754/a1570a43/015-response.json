The primary colors involved are white (0), red (2), and green (3).  The transformation seems to involve a rearrangement or shifting of the red (2) pixels, while the green (3) pixels remain fixed. The input has a cross shape made of red, and it appears to be rotating.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The cross in the input is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to create the shape of the red cross in the output.\n4.
