Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   Find the contiguous "red block" (color 2).
    *   Find all "green pixels" (color 3).

2.  **Transformation Rule:**
    *   If the green pixels form a surrounding frame and there is a single green pixel in the direct center of the red block, and the red block forms a horizontal line, the red block rotates 90 degrees clockwise around that center green pixel.
    *  If the green pixels form a surrounding frame and the red block forms a horizontal line segment and its center aligns with a green center, rotate the segment.
    *   If the green pixels form a surrounding frame and the red block is a vertical line, the red block translates horizontally such that its leftmost pixel aligns with the column where the original rightmost red pixel was present.
    *   All green pixels remain in their original positions.

3. **Output:** create a new grid with the red block after the transformation and preserve original green pixels

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was a good start, correctly identifying the red and green objects and implementing rotation and translation. However, it's clear from the test results that the conditions for applying these transformations, and potentially the transformations themselves, are not entirely accurate and need refinement based on all the training examples. The code was primarily based on the first training example, which involved a rotation. The other examples demonstrate different behaviors, and we have missed edge cases in the first example, such as the exact definition of "center".

My strategy will be to:

1.  **Examine Each Example:** Carefully analyze each input/output pair, noting the specific arrangement of red and green pixels and how the red block changes.
2.  **Identify Patterns:** Look for common rules and conditions across multiple examples.
3.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to reflect the complete set of rules governing the transformations.
4.  **Refine the Code:** adjust the code based on a deeper analysis.

**Example and Results Metrics**

I need to gather precise information about each example. I will use `code_execution` to compute and display relevant properties. Here's a breakdown of what I'll collect and why:

*   **Red Block Properties:**
    *   Shape (horizontal line, vertical line, other)
    *   Dimensions (length/height)
    *   Center coordinates (as precisely as possible)
*   **Green Pixel Properties:**
    *   Number of green pixels
    *   Relative positions to the red block (surrounding, partially surrounding, etc.)
    *    Determine if "center" green pixel exists
*   **Transformation:**
    *   Type (rotation, translation, none)
    *   Parameters (rotation angle, translation vector)

Let's execute some code to collect these metrics and create a YAML block:

```python

def calculate_center(coords):
    min_x = min(coords[:, 0])
    max_x = max(coords[:, 0])
    min_y = min(coords[:, 1])
    max_y = max(coords[:, 1])
    return np.array([(min_x + max_x) / 2.0, (min_y + max_y) / 2.0])

    red_block = get_red_block(input_grid)

    red_center = calculate_center(red_block) if len(red_block) >0 else None
    num_green = len(green_pixels)

    #very simple transformation detection
    transformed_red_block = get_red_block(output_grid)
    transformation = "none"

    if(len(red_block) != len(transformed_red_block)):
        transformation = "unknown"
    elif (len(red_block) > 0 and len(transformed_red_block) > 0):

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Objects:**
    *   Locate the contiguous block of red pixels (color 2).
    *   Locate all green pixels (color 3).

2.  **Analyze Red Object Shape:**
    *   Determine if the red block forms a horizontal line, a vertical line, or another shape.
    *   Calculate the center of the red block.

3.  **Analyze Green Object Positions:**
    *  Determine the number of green pixels.
    *  Check their positions relative to the red block (e.g. surrounding, below, etc.)

4.  **Transformation Rules:**

    *   **Rule 1 (Rotation):** If the red block is a horizontal line, and there is *at least* one green pixel directly above, and one green pixel directly below the center of the red line, then the red block rotates 90 degrees clockwise around its center.
    *   **Rule 2 (No Transformation):** If the red block is a vertical line and the green pixels form a horizontal line directly below *and are equal in length*, there is no transformation. The red block stays in place.
    *   **Rule 3 (Horizontal Translation):** If the red block is a vertical line, and the green pixels are in a line below the red block, and the green pixels extend at least one pixel beyond the width of the red block on either side, then the red block translates horizontally. The leftmost pixel of the translated red block aligns with the column of the original rightmost red pixel.
    *   **Rule 4 (Default - No Change):**  If none of the above conditions are met, the red object does not move.

5.  **Output:**
    *   Create a new grid, retaining all original green pixels.
    *  Apply the determined transformation (or no transformation) of the red block to the new grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
