Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids with integer values representing colors. The primary colors observed are red (2), green (3), and white/background (0). The core transformation seems to involve manipulating the red (2) pixels while preserving the green (3) and white (0) pixels. The shape formed by the red pixels appears to be an "arrow" or cross-like figure. The transformation seems to involve rotating this red shape. The green pixels act like fixed "anchors" or boundaries and do not move.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        - 0  # Background/White
        - 2  # Red
        - 3  # Green
      position: [row, column]
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 2 #red
      form: arrow/cross
      pixels: list of pixel objects

actions:
  - name: rotate
    object: shape
    parameters:
      direction: clockwise
      angle: 90 degrees

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: Green pixels remain fixed.
    objects: [pixel, pixel]
  - type: transformation
    description: Red shape rotates around a central point
    objects: [shape, shape]
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all pixels with the value 2 (red) and group them as a single shape. Identify pixels with the value 3 (green) and consider their locations as fixed.

2.  **Rotate Shape:** Rotate the red shape 90 degrees clockwise. The "center" of rotation appears to be implicitly defined within the red shape itself and shifts appropriately with each rotation.

3. **Preserve Other Pixels.** Keep all pixels with the value 0 (white/background) and 3 (green) in their original positions. The transformation only affects red objects.

4.  **Output:** Generate the new grid with the rotated red shape and the unchanged green and white pixels.
