  - example_1:
      input:
        objects:
          red_block:
            shape: 1x3 horizontal line
            position: row 2, centered
          green_block:
            shape: fills remainder of grid.
            position: surrounds the red block
      output:
        objects:
          red_block:
            shape: 3x1 vertical line
            position:  column 4, centered vertically
          green_block:
            shape: fills remainder of grid.
            position: surrounds the red block
      transformation:
        red_block: rotates 90 degrees clockwise around the center green pixel.
        green_block: remains in place.

            position: row 8, centered
          green_block:
             shape: fills remainder of grid
             position: surrounds the red block
      output:
        objects:
          red_block:
            shape: 2x1 vertical line
            position:  column 6, rows 8 and 9
          green_block:
            shape: fills remainder of grid
            position: surrounds the red block
      transformation:
        red_block:  rotates 90 degrees clockwise around green block and its own center.
        green_block: remains in place

      input:
        objects:
          red_block:
            shape: 3x1 vertical line
            position: column 2
          green_block:
            shape: fills remainder of grid
            position: surrounds red block
      output:
        objects:
          red_block:
            shape: 3x1 vertical line
            position: column 4
          green_block:
             shape: fills remainder of the grid.
             position: surrounds the red block
      transformation:
        red_block: translates two columns to the right.
        green_block: remains in the same original position.
