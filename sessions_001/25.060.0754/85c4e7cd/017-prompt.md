Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms an input grid to an output grid by swapping colors based on a specific rule.
The transformation identifies the central 2x2 block in the input, uses its color
for the output border, and inverts the colors of the inner layers.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify.  We will modify the copy and return it as the output
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    
    # Get the dimensions of the grid
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Get center 2x2 color. We assume the grid size is > 2 for this task
    center_color = input_grid[rows//2, cols//2]

    # Set border color of output
    output_grid[0, :] = center_color
    output_grid[-1, :] = center_color
    output_grid[:, 0] = center_color
    output_grid[:, -1] = center_color

    # Invert other colors based on position

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
