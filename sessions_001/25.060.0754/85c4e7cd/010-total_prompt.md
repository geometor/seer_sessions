Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input and output grids have the same dimensions (6x6). The colors are represented by single-digit integers. There's a clear swapping of two colors based on their initial positions.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 6x6
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      color:
        type: integer
        values: [1, 2, 6]

actions:
  - type: swap_colors
    parameters:
      color1: 2 #red
      color2: 6 #magenta
    conditions:
      - "color1 and color 2 are in the border of the original object"

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Pixels are arranged in a 2D grid."
  - type: transformation
    description: "Input grid pixels' colors are swapped based on a rule to produce the output grid."

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the Colors to Swap**: The transformation involves swapping colors 2 (red) and 6 (magenta).
2.  **Perform the Swap**: Every instance of color 2 in the input grid is replaced with color 6 in the output grid, and every instance of color 6 in the input grid is replaced with color 2 in the output grid.
3. All other colors stay the same.

In simpler terms, the rule is: "Swap all pixels of color 2 (red) with color 6 (magenta) and vice-versa".

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
