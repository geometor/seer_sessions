The input and output grids appear to have a nested structure, with concentric layers of colors. The colors in corresponding positions within each layer seem to be swapped according to a consistent rule. The innermost 2x2 block appears important, as does the consistent shape of the containing blocks.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The outermost layer is the first layer, the next inner layer is the second layer, and so on. The innermost 2x2 block is the core or central layer.\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Create a color mapping between the input and output grids based on layers:\n    *   Layer 1 (outermost): Input color 7 (orange) becomes 3 (green).\n    *   Layer 2: Input color 2 (red) becomes 1 (blue).\n    *   Layer 3: Input Color 4 (yellow) remains 4 (yellow)\n    *   Layer 4: Input color 1 (blue) becomes 2 (red).\n    *   Layer 5 (innermost 2x2): Input color 3 (green) becomes 7 (orange).\n3.  **Apply Mapping:** For each pixel in the input grid, determine its layer. Based on the layer, apply the corresponding color mapping to generate the output pixel's color. Construct an output grid in which all pixels have received color values from the input according to the color mapping per identified layer.\n\n"
