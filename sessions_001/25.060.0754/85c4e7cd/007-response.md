Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code and natural language program were a good starting point, correctly identifying the core concept of a color mapping. The code successfully handles the cases presented and maintains the structure. Since all training examples succeeded, this indicates that the color mapping and the overall approach of iterating through pixels and applying the map are correct. No changes or further strategy appears to be required at this moment.

**Metrics and Observations:**

Since I don't have capability to do code execution, I will state assumptions where that information would be useful, I can provide observations of the output produced by the prior turn. Since I can see the inputs, outputs, and the results of the tests, I can make inferences about the successful execution.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Shape: 9x9
    *   Output Shape: 9x9
    *   Colors in Input: Yellow, Red, Blue
    *   Colors in Output: Azure, Grey, Green
    *   Transformation Result: Success. The color mapping {4: 8, 2: 5, 1: 3} was correctly applied.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Shape: 7x7
    *   Output Shape: 7x7
    *   Colors in Input: Yellow, Red, Green
    *   Colors in Output: Azure, Grey, Blue
    *   Transformation Result: Success. The color mapping {4: 8, 2: 5, 3:1} was correctly applied.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Input Shape: 5x5
    *   Output Shape: 5x5
    *   Colors in Input: Yellow, Red
    *   Colors in Output: Azure, Grey
    *   Transformation Result: Success. The color mapping {4: 8, 2: 5} was correctly applied.

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
facts:
  - description: "The input and output grids have the same dimensions."
    type: observation
    scope: general
  - description: "The transformation preserves the spatial structure (nested squares)."
    type: observation
    scope: general
  - description: "A fixed color mapping is applied to each pixel."
    type: observation
    scope: general
  - color_mapping: "{4: 8, 2: 5, 1: 3, 3:1}"
    type: rule
    scope: specific
  - object_type: nested_squares
    properties:
      - color: varies
      - size: varies
      - position: centered
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation involves changing the colors of nested squares within a grid while preserving their spatial arrangement. A fixed color mapping is applied to each pixel in the input grid to produce the output grid. The mapping is as follows:

*   Yellow (4) becomes Azure (8)
*   Red (2) becomes Grey (5)
*   Blue (1) becomes Green (3)
*   Green (3) becomes Blue (1)

The input and output grids have identical dimensions. The nested square structure and relative sizes of the squares are the same in the input and the output.
