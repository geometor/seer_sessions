objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - shape: rectangular
  - name: layer
    properties:
      - type: concentric square
      - description: A set of pixels forming a square border within the grid.  Each layer is one pixel wide.
      - relationship: nested (layers are contained within other layers)
  - name: color_mapping
    properties:
      - type: dictionary
      - description:  Maps input colors to output colors *within* each layer.

actions:
  - name: invert_layer
    description:  The outermost layer of the input becomes the innermost in the output; the second outermost in the input is second innermost and so on. Each layer maintains relative position.
  - name: map_color
    description: For each layer, a specific input color is consistently mapped to a specific output color.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid.
  - layer_to_layer:  Input layers map to output layers based on an "inversion" of their order.
  - color_to_color: Within each layer, input colors map to output colors.
