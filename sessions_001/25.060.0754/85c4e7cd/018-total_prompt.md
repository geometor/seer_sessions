Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on observations from the first training example, and it seems to have captured some aspects of the transformation, but not all. Specifically, it correctly identifies the use of the center 2x2 block's color for the border and attempts an inversion of colors in the inner layers. However, the inversion logic is incomplete and only handles specific color pairs, leading to incorrect results in subsequent examples. The code fails to address the consistent object structure observed, where only some colors are inverted (the cross), and the colors in other objects are left unchanged (square, L shape).

Our strategy will be to:

1.  **Verify dimensions and center color:** Use code execution to confirm the grid dimensions and the color of the central 2x2 block for each example.
2.  **Analyze color changes:** Identify all color changes between the input and output grids, paying close attention to positions and context.
3.  **Refine the inversion rule:** Develop a more accurate description of which colors get inverted and under what conditions.
4.  **Structure Observations**: Document the specific colors, shapes, and positions in each task example.
5.  **Document the "story"**: Write the refined transformation as a natural language program.

**Code Execution for Metrics:**

```python
import numpy as np

def get_center_color(grid):
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    return grid[rows//2, cols//2]

def get_changed_colors(grid1, grid2):

    changes = []

    for r in range(grid1.shape[0]):
        for c in range(grid1.shape[1]):
            if grid1[r,c] != grid2[r,c]:
                changes.append(f'Changed ({r},{c}) from {grid1[r,c]} to {grid2[r,c]}')

    return changes

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the center color:** Find the color of the central 2x2 block of the input grid.
2.  **Set the border:** Change the color of all pixels on the perimeter (border) of the output grid to the center color.
3.  **Identify the inner cross:** Inside the grid (excluding the border), locate a "cross" shaped object. A "cross" consists of pixels that are vertically and horizontally adjacent to the center 2x2, but *excluding* the center 2x2 itself.
4.  **Invert Cross Colors:**  Invert the colors within the cross. Use this color mapping for the inversion:
    *   gray (8) <-> yellow (4)
    *   red (2) <-> blue (1)
5. **Other objects**: Leave the other objects unchanged.

This program refines the previous attempt by explicitly defining the "cross" shape and its inversion rule, separating the inner objects into distinct components (the cross, and others) and handling the other colors correctly.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
