Okay, I've reviewed the input-output pairs provided. Here's my analysis of the task, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming input grids to output grids. The most apparent visual pattern is an "inversion" of colors, where the outermost color of the input becomes the innermost color of the output, and vice-versa.  There's a nested structure, almost like layers of an onion or a series of concentric squares. Each layer in the input seems to map to a corresponding, but potentially different colored, layer in the output.  The transformation appears to be a one-to-one color mapping within each layer.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9, representing colors)
      - shape: rectangular
  - name: layer
    properties:
      - type: concentric square
      - description: A set of pixels forming a square border within the grid.  Each layer is one pixel wide.
      - relationship: nested (layers are contained within other layers)
  - name: color_mapping
    properties:
      - type: dictionary
      - description:  Maps input colors to output colors *within* each layer.

actions:
  - name: invert_layer
    description:  The outermost layer of the input becomes the innermost in the output; the second outermost in the input is second innermost and so on. Each layer maintains relative position.
  - name: map_color
    description: For each layer, a specific input color is consistently mapped to a specific output color.

relationships:
  - input_grid_to_output_grid: The output grid is a transformed version of the input grid.
  - layer_to_layer:  Input layers map to output layers based on an "inversion" of their order.
  - color_to_color: Within each layer, input colors map to output colors.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1. **Identify Layers:** Divide both the input and output grids into concentric square layers. The number of layers is determined by the smaller dimension of the grid (width or height) divided by 2, rounded down.

2. **Invert Layer Order:** Reverse the order of the layers. The outermost layer of the input corresponds to the innermost layer of the output, the second-outermost input layer corresponds to the second-innermost output layer, and so on.

3. **Determine Color Mapping:** For each pair of corresponding layers (input and output), determine the color mapping.  Observe which color in the input layer maps to which color in the corresponding output layer. This mapping appears to be consistent across all examples.

4. **Apply Transformation:**  Create the output grid by iterating through the *input* layers in *reversed* order. For each layer, replace the input color with its corresponding output color based on the mapping determined in step 3.
    - The first layer's color in the input becomes the innermost color of the output.
    - The second input layer color fills the second innermost ring, and so on.
    - The last input ring fills the outside of the output grid.

The core concept is a layer-wise color swap, with the order of layers inverted. The color mapping is constant *within* each corresponding layer pair, but the mapping *differs* between different layer pairs.
