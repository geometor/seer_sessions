The background is white (0). There appear to be two main types of objects:\n\n1.  **Yellow (4) Isolated Pixels:** These are scattered throughout the grid, seemingly randomly.\n2.  **Blue (1) Rectangular Objects:** These are contiguous blocks of blue pixels forming rectangles of varying sizes. Some of these rectangles contain yellow pixels.\n\nThe transformation seems to involve some interaction between the blue rectangles and the yellow pixels. It is clear by observing the examples that where there were yellow objects inside of a blue rectangle, after the transformation it is now the blue rectangle filled with yellow, and surrounded by the same size of blue frame as was the width of the original rectangle.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
