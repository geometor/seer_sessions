The colors are represented by integers. The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or mirroring of the original grid. It's not a simple scaling; the arrangement of colors changes.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The first column of the input becomes both the first and last column of a 3x6 section. The second column of input becomes both the 2nd and 5th of that section. The final column of the input becomes the 3rd and 4th column of that section.\n3.  **Reflect Vertically:** This 3x6 grid from the prior step is then reflected vertically to complete 6x6 grid. The first row of the 3x6 section becomes the first and last row of the output, and so on.\n\nIn essence, the input grid is mirrored along both its horizontal and vertical axes to create the output grid. The center of each grid remains in the center after the transformations.\n"
