The grids contain single-digit integers representing colors. The output grid appears to be a patterned expansion of the input grid. The core pattern seems to be a 2x2 replication of each pixel in the input grid. The expansion creates a symmetrical \"cross\" or \"+\" shape centered within the output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

For instance the pixel at `input_grid[y][x]` is copied to locations `output_grid[2y][2x]`, `output_grid[2y+1][2x]`, `output_grid[2y][2x+1]`, and `output_grid[2y+1][2x+1]`.\n\n3. **Centering is implicit**: The replication process inherently results in central positioning and symmetry around the core input grid area.\n"
