**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single digit integer (0-9), representing colors. The transformation appears to operate on rows independently, and it seems to involve a kind of "drawing" or "filling" of existing colored segments based on their original positions and colors. The zero-valued cells (white) act as background and are largely unchanged, except where other colors expand into them. The transformation seems to replicate a color pattern within specific rows. The height of input and output grids is the same.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      - dimensions: 2D (rows x columns)
      - cells: integer values (0-9) representing colors
      - rows: independent units of transformation
  - type: colored_segment
    properties:
      - color: integer value (0-9, excluding 0 in most observed cases)
      - start_position: (row, column)
      - end_position: (row, column)
      - length: end_position.column - start_position.column + 1

actions:
  - name: replicate_segment
    description: Extends a colored segment within a row, possibly based on its existing pattern.
    parameters:
      - segment: colored_segment
      - row: specific grid row where the segment should be extended/replicated

relationships:
  - adjacency:  Crucial for defining segments (contiguous cells of the same color).
  - row_containment: Segments are contained within specific rows.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Iterate** through each row of the input grid.
2.  **Identify** "colored segments" within the current row. A colored segment is defined as a contiguous sequence of non-zero pixels of the same color.
3. Within the row, **if** there are non-zero pixels, check for the position.
4.  **For each** colored segment found, extend the segment to the right by first copying the single pixel and then repeating it by number of non-zero pixels.

In a more concise form:

For each row, if non-zero colored segments are present, extend them to the right by duplicating the pattern, repeating the segment color and then the next segment's, until the end of the row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
