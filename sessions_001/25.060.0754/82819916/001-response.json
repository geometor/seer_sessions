The transformation appears to operate on rows independently, and it seems to involve a kind of \"drawing\" or \"filling\" of existing colored segments based on their original positions and colors. The zero-valued cells (white) act as background and are largely unchanged, except where other colors expand into them. The transformation seems to replicate a color pattern within specific rows. The height of input and output grids is the same.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
