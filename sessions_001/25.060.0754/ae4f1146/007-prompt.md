"""
The transformation extracts pixels of color azure (8) and blue (1) from the input grid. These extracted pixels are then placed into a 3x3 output grid. The positioning within the 3x3 grid preserves the relative spatial arrangement of the azure and blue pixels as they appeared in the input grid, condensing them to fit. If there are no blue or azure pixels, a blank 3x3 grid with all 0 (white) pixels is returned.
The placement in the smaller grid isn't strictly scaled linearly, but an attempt is made at mapping the source pixels to locations in the 3x3 grid to maintain relative positions.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
