- objects:
    - name: input_grid
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - contains_colors: [0, 1, 8]
    - name: output_grid
      type: 2D array
      properties:
        - derived_from: input_grid
        - contains_colors: [0, 1, 8]
        - shape: varies (determined by bounding box of 1s and 8s in input)
