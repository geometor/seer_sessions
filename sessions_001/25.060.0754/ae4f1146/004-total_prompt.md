Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a larger grid (9x9) into a smaller grid (3x3). The input grid contains primarily two colors: azure (8) and blue (1), with some white (0) regions. The output grid seems to be a highly condensed version, retaining only the azure (8) and blue (1) pixels, and their relative positions seem significant. The white (0) pixels are entirely removed. It looks like a form of object extraction and down-sampling, focused on specific colors.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 9x9
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
        role: primary
      - color: blue (1)
        role: secondary
      - color: white (0)
        role: background
  - object: output_grid
    type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: azure (8)
      - color: blue (1)
  - action: transformation
    type: downsampling
    description: Extract and condense specific colored pixels, removing background.
  - relationship:
      type: spatial
      description: Relative positions of azure and blue pixels are maintained in a compressed form.
  - observation:
      type: color_filtering
      description: Only azure (8) and blue (1) pixels are preserved, white(0) are discarded
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Focus on pixels with the colors azure (8) and blue (1).
2.  **Discard Background:** Ignore all white (0) pixels.
3. **Scan and Condense:** Starting at some seed azure pixel, and moving out, if an 8 or 1 exists, the condensed grid's next spot will be that number.
4.  **Create Output Grid:** Construct a 3x3 grid.
5.  **Populate Condensed Grid:** Add the found 8 or 1.
6.  **Repeat:** Do this until the 3x3 is full.

Essentially, the transformation identifies specific colored pixels in the input and creates a condensed representation, preserving their core relative positions.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
