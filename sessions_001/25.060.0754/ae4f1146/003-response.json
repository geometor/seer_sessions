The input grid contains primarily two colors: azure (8) and blue (1), with some white (0) regions. The output grid seems to be a highly condensed version, retaining only the azure (8) and blue (1) pixels, and their relative positions seem significant. The white (0) pixels are entirely removed. It looks like a form of object extraction and down-sampling, focused on specific colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
