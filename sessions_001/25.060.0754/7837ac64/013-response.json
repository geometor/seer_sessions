There are a few instances of '2' (red) and '8' (azure) embedded within the green sections. The output is a much smaller 3x3 grid containing only '0' (white), '2' (red), and '8' (azure). The output seems to be a highly condensed representation, or a \"summary\", of the non-green, non-white, pixels in the input. The relative positions of 2 and 8 in the output may correspond the relative positions of the upper leftmost such coloured pixel in each horizontal segment of the input grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Ignore pixels with values '0'(white) and '3' (green).\n2.  **Segment Input**: Divide the input grid rows in groups of 9 consecutive rows.\n3. **Find first non-white, non-green pixel:** in each segment, find the first, if it exists, appearence of a pixel that it is not white or green, looking from left to right, row by row.\n4.  **Map to Output:** Create a 3x3 output grid.\n    *   For the first segment, if a pixel was found, place its value in the output grid at position (0,0) if it is the first non-white/green pixel, (0,1) if it is second, and so on.\n    *    For the second segment, do a similar operation and place the result, if any, starting in position (1,0).\n    *   For the third segment, analogously, start filling the last row (2, x).\n    *   Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with '0' (white).\n\nIn short: The transformation extracts the 'red' and 'azure' pixels from specific regions input grid and places them, in order, in a 3x3 output grid, maintaining a coarse representation of their original relative horizontal positions. Other cells are set to white.\n"
