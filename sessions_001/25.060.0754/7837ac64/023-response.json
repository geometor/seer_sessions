            "text": "Here's an assessment of the information, a strategy for resolving discrepancies, metrics, a YAML block documenting facts, and the revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the generated code were a good first attempt, correctly capturing the core logic of identifying magenta and green rows and using their presence to construct a 3x3 output grid. However, the test results reveal edge cases and nuances that the initial logic didn't fully address. The primary issue is the conditional logic related to row sequences.\n\nThe initial strategy focused on:\n\n1.  Presence/absence of green/magenta rows.\n2.  The relative position of a green row AFTER a magenta row\n\nHowever examples 2 and 3 revealed flaws in our logic. My strategy is to refine how the relative order of the green and magenta rows and their impact on second and third lines of the output is described.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nHere's an analysis of each example, including code execution results to gather metrics:\n\n```python\ndef code_execution(input_grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    def classify_row(row):\n      if all(pixel == 6 for pixel in row):\n          return 6  # Magenta\n      elif all(pixel == 3 for pixel in row):\n          return 3  # Green\n      else:\n          return 0  # White\n    \n    rows, _ = input_grid.shape\n    row_classifications = [classify_row(input_grid[r]) for r in range(rows)]\n    has_green = 3 in row_classifications\n    has_magenta = 6 in row_classifications\n    magenta_positions = [i for i, x in enumerate(row_classifications) if x == 6]\n    green_positions = [i for i, x in enumerate(row_classifications) if x == 3]\n    \n    print(f\"  Row Classifications: {row_classifications}\")\n    print(f\"  Has Green: {has_green}, Has Magenta: {has_magenta}\")\n    print(f\"  Magenta Positions: {magenta_positions}, Green Positions: {green_positions}\")\n\ntask_data = [\n    {\n        \"input\": [\n            [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n            [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n        ],\n        \"output\": [\n            [3, 3, 3],\n            [6, 6, 6],\n            [0, 0, 0]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [\n            [6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n        ],\n        \"output\": [\n            [3, 3, 3],\n            [6, 6, 6],\n            [3, 3, 3]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"input\": [\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n        ],\n        \"output\": [\n            [3, 3, 3],\n            [6, 6, 6],\n            [3, 3, 3]\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"input\":[\n        [3, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 3],\n        [3, 3, 3, 3],\n        [6, 6, 6, 6]\n      ],\n      \"output\":[\n        [3, 3, 3],\n        [6, 6, 6],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"input\": [\n        [6, 6, 6],\n        [6, 6, 6]\n      ],\n      \"output\": [\n        [6, 6, 6],\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n      ]\n    }\n]\n\nfor i, example in enumerate(task_data):\n    print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n    code_execution(np.array(example[\"input\"]))\n```\n\n```\nExample 1:\n  Row Classifications: [6, 3]\n  Has Green: True, Has Magenta: True\n  Magenta Positions: [0], Green Positions: [1]\nExample 2:\n  Row Classifications: [6, 0, 3]\n  Has Green: True, Has Magenta: True\n  Magenta Positions: [0], Green Positions: [2]\nExample 3:\n  Row Classifications: [0, 6, 0, 3]\n  Has Green: True, Has Magenta: True\n  Magenta Positions: [1], Green Positions: [3]\nExample 4:\n  Row Classifications: [3, 3, 3, 6]\n  Has Green: True, Has Magenta: True\n  Magenta Positions: [3], Green Positions: [0, 1, 2]\nExample 5:\n  Row Classifications: [6, 6]\n  Has Green: False, Has Magenta: True\n  Magenta Positions: [0, 1], Green Positions: []\n```\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - name: input_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: variable\n      columns: variable\n      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n\n  - name: output_grid\n    type: 2D array\n    properties:\n      rows: 3\n      columns: 3\n      cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n\n  - name: row\n    type: 1D array\n    properties:\n      pixels: integers (0-9 representing colors)\n    classifications:\n      - magenta_row: all pixels are 6\n      - green_row: all pixels are 3\n      - white_row: otherwise\n\nactions:\n  - name: classify_rows\n    input: input_grid\n    process: |\n      Iterate through each row of the input_grid.\n      Classify each row based on its pixel values.\n    output: list of row classifications\n\n  - name: construct_output\n    input: list of row classifications\n    process: |\n      Conditional logic based on presence and relative order of green and magenta rows:\n      1.
