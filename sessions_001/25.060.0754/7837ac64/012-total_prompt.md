Train Set Results:
Here's a breakdown of the information, analysis, and proposed updates:

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was too specific, focusing on the first co-occurrence of blue and green and creating a fixed 3x3 output. The provided examples demonstrate a different, more general pattern. The core concept revolves around identifying *all* instances of a particular sub-grid pattern within the input and reproducing a corresponding, potentially different, subgrid pattern in the output. The original code only handles one specific case of the pattern and output. The output size is also not fixed, as in example 3.

The strategy to fix this is to generalize the approach:

1.  **Generalized Pattern Matching:** Instead of looking for the first occurrence of specific colors, we need to search for *all* occurrences of a specific 2x2 pattern in input.
2.  **Pattern Mapping:** Clearly define the mapping between the input 2x2 pattern and the output pattern, including its size and relative position.
3.  **Dynamic Output:** The output grid needs to be dynamically sized based on the number of matched patterns found, and their new positions.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

Here's a breakdown of each example, including a comparison between the expected output and the output from the initial code:

    description: Locates all occurrences of input_pattern within input_grid.

    output: output_grid
    description:  Creates the output grid. For each (y,x) coordinate in list, place the output pattern in output_grid starting at those coords.
```

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Input Pattern:** The input pattern is a 2x2 subgrid where the top-left cell is blue (1), the bottom-left cell is green (3), and the two right-hand cells can be any color.

2.  **Find All Occurrences:** Locate *all* instances of this 2x2 pattern within the input grid. Record the top-left coordinates (y, x) of each match.

3.  **Generate Output:** Create an output grid, initially filled with white (0). For *each* occurrence of the input pattern found:
    *   Place a 2x1 subgrid at the corresponding (y, x) location in the output grid.
    * The 2x1 output pattern is blue (1) on top and green (3) on the bottom.

4.  **Output Dimensions:** The dimensions of output grid is the same as the input.

In essence, the transformation finds all 2x2 regions matching `[[1, _], [3, _]]` in the input and replaces them with `[[1], [3]]` in the output at the same (y, x) coordinate, keeping the original input grid dimensions and filling any unmatched areas with white (0).

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
