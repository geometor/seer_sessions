**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 3x3 grids. Each cell in the grid contains a single digit integer, representing a color. The transformation seems to selectively change some of these cells to the color gray (5), while leaving others unchanged. The selection criteria for changing to gray is not immediately obvious but seems related to the colors present and possibly their positions. It appears non-gray colors that get replaced can be either at corners, edge centers, or in the middle of the grids. It also appears that different non-gray values are replaced by gray.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
task_name: Color Replacement with Gray
input_grid_size: 3x3
output_grid_size: 3x3
colors:
  0: white
  1: blue
  2: red
  3: green
  4: yellow
  5: gray
  6: magenta
  7: orange
  8: azure
  9: maroon
replacement_color: gray (5)
objects:
  - grid: 3x3 array of colored cells
  - cell: individual element within the grid, represented by a digit (0-9)
actions:
  - replace_color: Change the color of a cell to gray (5)
conditions:
  - varied_colors: Input grids have a mix of different colors.
  - selective_replacement: Only certain cells have color changes, rules not clear yet

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Target Colors:** Examine the input grid. Determine which colors, other than gray (5), are present.
2.  **Locate and Replace.** Examine the input grid. The output grid replaces certain colors with gray (5) based on the following rule: If an azure (8), a blue(1), a red(2), a green(3) is present, then replace them with grey(5), keeping every other color in place.

This natural language program explains the color transformations.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
