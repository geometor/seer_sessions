**input:**
```
2 2 2
8 8 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A175416CDD0>

**output:**
```
2 2 2
5 5 2
2 2 2
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x7A1754162DD0>
Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid. The input grid contains two colors: red (2) and azure (8). The output grid contains red (2) and gray (5). The azure pixels in the input are replaced by gray pixels in the output, while the red pixels remain unchanged. The transformation seems to be a simple color replacement.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: pixels
    properties:
      - color:
          input: [red, azure]
          output: [red, gray]

actions:
  - type: color_replacement
    details:
      - from: azure
        to: gray

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    details: The relative positions of the pixels remain constant.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Replace** each identified azure pixel with a gray (5) pixel.
3.  **Keep** all other pixels (red - 2) unchanged.
4. The grid structure should remain the same (3x3)

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
