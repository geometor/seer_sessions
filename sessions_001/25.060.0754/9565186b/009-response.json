The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input grid contains a variety of colors (blue, azure, green, red), while the output grid seems to simplify the colors, predominantly using blue and gray. The top row of the input and output grids remain identical (all blue). The transformation appears to focus on the lower two rows.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
