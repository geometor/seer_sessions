Previous Code:
```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  Iterate through every pixel of the input grid.
2.  If a pixel is azure (color code 8), change it to gray (color code 5).
3.  If a pixel is any color other than azure, leave it unchanged. Specifically, red (color 2) pixels are not modified.
4.  The output grid has the same dimensions (height and width) as the input grid. No pixels are added or removed, and the grid structure is preserved.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    # Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.  This ensures
    # the dimensions are the same and that we don't modify the original.
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Iterate through each pixel's coordinates using NumPy's ndindex.
    for index in np.ndindex(input_grid.shape):
        # Check if the current pixel is azure (color code 8).
        if input_grid[index] == 8:
            # Replace azure pixels with gray pixels (color code 5).
            output_grid[index] = 5
        # Implicit else:  If not azure, no change is made due to the copy.

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
