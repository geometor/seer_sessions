  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array
      - values: integers (0-9 representing colors)
      - cell_value: determined by presence of magenta (6) in corresponding input region
    relations:
      - to: input_grid
        type: downsampled from
        rule: input regions map to single output pixels
  - object: input_region
    properties:
      - type: sub-grid of input_grid
    relations:
      - to: output_grid
        type: maps to
        rule:  single output pixel
  - condition: magenta_presence
    properties:
        - check: if 6 exists
    relations:
      - to: output_value
        type: determines value
        rule: if present, output is 1 (blue); otherwise, output is 0 (white)
