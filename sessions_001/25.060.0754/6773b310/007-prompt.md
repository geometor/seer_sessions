Previous Code:
```python
"""
The program maps 3x3 regions (or 2x3 in the last example) of the input grid to single pixels in the output grid. If a 3x3 region in the input contains magenta (color 6), the corresponding output pixel is blue (color 1). Otherwise, the output pixel is white (color 0).  The input grid is surrounded by an azure (color 8) border, which is effectively removed during the downsampling process because the mapping uses integer division of input dimensions by output dimensions.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid according to the described rules.
    """
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    output_rows = 3 if rows > 6 else 2 # rows are > 6 for first 3 examples and 6 for last
    output_cols = 3 if cols > 6 else 2

    output_grid = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)

    for i in range(output_rows):
        for j in range(output_cols):
            # Define the 3x3 region in the input grid
            row_start = i * (rows // output_rows)
            row_end = (i + 1) * (rows // output_rows)
            col_start = j * (cols // output_cols)
            col_end = (j + 1) * (cols // output_cols)
            
            block = input_grid[row_start:row_end, col_start:col_end]

            # Check for magenta (6) in the block

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
