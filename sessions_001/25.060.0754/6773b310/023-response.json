While this worked for the first example, the subsequent examples reveal a flaw in the approach. The core issue is that the code doesn't truly identify the *cross-like structure* itself. Instead, it divides the input grid into nine overlapping regions and checks for the presence of azure (8) within each region, setting the corresponding output cell to blue (1) if found. This is a rudimentary form of downsampling, but not an intelligent identification of the core pattern.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors should, therefore be:\n\n1.  **Shift from Region-Based to Object-Based:** Instead of dividing the grid into arbitrary regions, we need to detect the azure (8) pixels as part of a connected object (the cross).\n2.  **Identify the Cross:** Implement a method to recognize the \"cross-like\" nature of the azure structure. This could involve checking for connectivity and the characteristic shape (a central pixel with four neighbors).\n3.  **Handle Noise:** Ensure the magenta (6) pixels are correctly ignored, even if they are adjacent to the azure structure.\n4. Refactor the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nTo understand the patterns better, let's define a function to analyze the input and output grids, reporting on the presence, location, and connectivity of colors, especially azure (8) and magenta (6). I'll focus on misclassified examples.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_grid(grid, title=\"\"):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    print(f\"--- {title} ---\")\n    print(f\"Shape:
