Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input is a large grid (11x11) containing three colors: white (0), azure (8), and magenta (6). The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) containing only white (0) and blue (1). The output seems to represent a simplified, abstract summary of the input, focusing on the presence and relative position of the non-white colors, particularly the azure (8).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 11x11
    colors: [0, 6, 8]  # white, magenta, azure
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    colors: [0, 1]  # white, blue

  - type: object_cluster
    name: azure_cluster
    color: 8
    shape: rectangle

  - type: object
    name: magenta_object
    color: 6
    shape: single_pixels
    count: >0

relations:
  - type: spatial
    description: "Input grid contains a large horizontal rectangle of azure pixels and scattered magenta pixels."
  - type: abstraction
    description: "Output grid seems to abstract the core features of the input."
    
actions:
  - type: simplification
    description: reduces the grid size
  - type: feature_extraction
    description: extracts a boolean summary of the presence of colors in sections of the input
  - type: color_mapping
    input_color_8: output_color_1
    input_color_6: output_color_0
    input_color_0: output_color_0

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Divide:** Divide the input grid into nine equal sections (a 3x3 meta-grid). Since the original dimensions are 11x11, this won't be a perfect division but follow the ARC-AGI principals to create a concept of 9 regions.
2.  **Check Sections:** For each of the nine sections:
    *   If the section contains any azure (8) pixels, represent that section in the output grid with a blue (1) pixel.
    *   If a section does *not* contain any azure (8) pixels, represent that section with a white (0) pixel. This effectively treats magenta and white the same way.
3.  **Output:** Construct the 3x3 output grid based on the above checks.

In essence, the program checks for the presence of azure (8) within each of the nine conceptual regions of the input grid and creates a boolean representation (present/absent) in the output grid. Magenta is treated as a distractor and collapsed to white.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
