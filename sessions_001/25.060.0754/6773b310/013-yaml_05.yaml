facts:
  - observation: |
      The presence of azure (8) pixels in the input grid seems to determine
      the presence of blue (1) pixels in the output grid.
  - object_property: |
      Azure pixels can appear anywhere in input.
  - transformation_rule: |
      Examples 2, 3, and 4 have azure, but output has *no* blue.
      When azure pixels are present in input *and* there is blue in output
      (example 1), the azure pixels *only* exist at the extreme corners of a
      rectangle that contains them. The blue pixel in output is at a respective
      corner of a coarse 3x3 grid aligned with the azure-defined rectangle.
  - counter_example: |
      In example 3, a rectangle can be inferred with two azure pixels.
      The inferred rectangle would be from (1,3) to (3,6). However, there are no
      blue pixels in the output.
