The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) containing only white (0) and blue (1). The azure squares in the input grid seem to form a regular, cross-like, shape. Magenta seems scattered randomly. The output grid appears to have downsampled the general \"shape\" of the azure, replacing azure by blue (1).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Sections that were covered with a value of \"8\" should be converted to \"1\", others to \"0\".\n\nEssentially, the transformation extracts the essential shape formed by the azure pixels, simplifies it by downsampling and replaces azure (8) with blue(1) . The magenta pixels are discarded.\n"
