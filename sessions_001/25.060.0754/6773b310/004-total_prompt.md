Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input is a large grid (11x11) with three colors: white (0), azure (8), and magenta (6).
*   The output is a smaller grid (3x3) with two colors: white (0) and blue (1).
*   The azure (8) pixels in the input grid seem to form a consistent border or frame.
*   The magenta (6) and white (0) pixels are inside the border, and their presence/absence is reflected in the output.
*   There is a reduction in size and a change in color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    name: input_grid
    dimensions: 11x11
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: azure
        value: 8
      - color: magenta
        value: 6
  - type: grid
    name: output_grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements:
      - color: white
        value: 0
      - color: blue
        value: 1

actions:
  - type: size_reduction
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
  - type: color_mapping
    mapping:
      - input: 6 #magenta
        output: 1 #blue
      - input: 0 #white
        output: 0 #white
      - input: 8 #azure
        output: 0 #remove azure?

relationships:
  - input_grid contains output_grid conceptually (after transformation)
  - azure forms border in input_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the core region:** Disregard the azure (8) colored pixels that create the outer border. Focus on the inner 9x9 part of the Input Grid.
2.  **Down-sample the grid:** Consider non-overlapping 3x3 blocks within the inner 9x9 region. This results in a 3 x 3 grid.
3. **Color transformation**:
    * For a given 3 x 3 block the following logic is used to color the output pixel.
    * If the 3x3 region in the input contains any magenta (6) pixels, the corresponding output pixel is blue (1).
    * If the 3x3 region in the input grid contains only white (0), the output pixel should be white (0)

In essence, the program detects the presence of magenta (6) within each 3x3 sub-region of the core area (excluding the azure border) and maps that to blue (1) in the output. Otherwise, the output is white(0). The azure border is effectively removed, and the grid is significantly down-sampled.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
