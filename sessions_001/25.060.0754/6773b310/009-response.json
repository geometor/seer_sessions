The output is a much smaller grid (3x3) containing only white (0) and blue (1). The output seems to represent a simplified, abstract summary of the input, focusing on the presence and relative position of the non-white colors, particularly the azure (8).\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

Since the original dimensions are 11x11, this won't be a perfect division but follow the ARC-AGI principals to create a concept of 9 regions.\n2.  **Check Sections:** For each of the nine sections:\n    *   If the section contains any azure (8) pixels, represent that section in the output grid with a blue (1) pixel.\n    *   If a section does *not* contain any azure (8) pixels, represent that section with a white (0) pixel. This effectively treats magenta and white the same way.\n3.  **Output:** Construct the 3x3 output grid based on the above checks.\n\nIn essence, the program checks for the presence of azure (8) within each of the nine conceptual regions of the input grid and creates a boolean representation (present/absent) in the output grid. Magenta is treated as a distractor and collapsed to white.\n"
