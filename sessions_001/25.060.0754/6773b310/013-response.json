            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the first training example, focusing on dividing the input grid into nine sections and checking for azure pixels at the corners of each section. This approach works for the first example but fails to generalize to the others. The core issue is that the initial hypothesis is too specific and doesn't capture the underlying rule that applies to all examples.\n\nThe strategy for resolving errors is to:\n\n1.  **Analyze each example:** Carefully examine the input and output grids, paying attention to the placement of azure and blue pixels.\n2.  **Identify common patterns:** Look for relationships between the azure pixels in the input and the blue pixels in the output that hold true across all examples.\n3.  **Refine the natural language program:** Update the description to reflect the generalized rule discovered by analyzing all examples.\n4. **Rethink objectness:** The concept of fixed 3x3 meta grid division might not be the right prior.\n\n**Example Analysis and Metrics**\n\nTo perform the code execution, I will represent grids in plain text to improve the ability to track the changes across history.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n*   **Input:**\n\n```\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000080008000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n080000000080\n000000000000\n000000000000\n```\n\n*   **Expected Output:**\n\n```\n000\n000\n101\n```\n\n*   **Actual Output:**\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]\n```\n\n*   **Result:** Correct\n\n**Example 2**\n\n*   **Input:**\n\n```\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000800000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n800000000000000008\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000008000000008000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n```\n\n*   **Expected Output:**\n\n```\n000\n000\n000\n```\n\n*   **Actual Output:**\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n*   **Result:** Correct\n\n**Example 3**\n\n*   **Input:**\n\n```\n000000000\n000800000\n000000000\n000000800\n```\n\n*   **Expected Output:**\n\n```\n000\n000\n```\n\n*   **Actual Output:**\n\n```\n[[0, 0], [0, 0]]\n```\n\n*  **Analysis:** The actual output shape doesn't match, so there is some edge-condition in the 3x3 meta-grid assumptions that fails. Also, the input has azure in two different quadrants, and both are *not* in the corners, yet the output is all zeros. This seems to contradict example 1.\n\n**Example 4**\n*   **Input:**\n\n```\n000080000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000800\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n```\n\n*   **Expected Output:**\n\n```\n000\n000\n```\n*   **Actual Output:**\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n\n```\n\n*  **Analysis:** Similar to example 3.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - observation: |\n      The presence of azure (8) pixels in the input grid seems to determine\n      the presence of blue (1) pixels in the output grid.\n  - object_property: |\n      Azure pixels can appear anywhere in input.\n  - transformation_rule: |\n      Examples 2, 3, and 4 have azure, but output has *no* blue.\n      When azure pixels are present in input *and* there is blue in output\n      (example 1), the azure pixels *only* exist at the extreme corners of a\n      rectangle that contains them. The blue pixel in output is at a respective\n      corner of a coarse 3x3 grid aligned with the azure-defined rectangle.\n  - counter_example: |\n      In example 3, a rectangle can be inferred with two azure pixels.\n      The inferred rectangle would be from (1,3) to (3,6). However, there are no\n      blue pixels in the output.\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Azure Rectangles:** Find all rectangles where the corner pixels are azure (8). Consider *all* possible rectangles that can be made.\n\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output is a representation of presence/absence of qualifying rectangles, with a maximum size of 3x3, but will be smaller if the input is smaller than 9x9.\n\n3. **No Azure Rectangle Rule.** If an azure rectangle does not exist, no blue pixel in output.\n\n4. **Presence/Absence:** It might be that the only rule needed is that if *any* azure rectangle can be made, the output grid is all zero.\n"
