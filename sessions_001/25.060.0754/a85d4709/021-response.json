The input grid contains only 0s (white) and 5s (gray), while the output grid contains 3s (green) and 4s (yellow). There's a clear change in colors and values, but the grid dimensions remain constant. The core challenge is to figure out the rule that dictates this color/value change.\n\n**YAML Block: Facts**\n\n"
