Okay, let's analyze the results of running the previously generated code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was based on a very limited observation (likely just the first training example). It correctly identified a row-dependent color transformation, but only for colors 0 (white) and 5 (gray).  The other examples show this transformation needs to be generalized. The core issue is that the transformation applies to *all* colors, not just white and gray, and the output color depends solely on the row index.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Dimensions:** Confirm that all input and output grids in the training examples have the same dimensions. This is a fundamental assumption of the current code.
2.  **Color Mapping Analysis:** For each row index (0, 1, and 2), determine the mapping of *every* input color to its corresponding output color. The initial code only captured the mapping for colors 0 and 5. We need to identify the full mapping for all colors present in the input grids.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:**  Based on the comprehensive color mapping analysis, rewrite the natural language program to accurately describe the transformation rule. The revised rule should state that the output color is determined solely by the row index, regardless of the input color.
4. **Prepare for Coding**: Create a YAML block that describes the task objects,
   properties and transformations.

**Example Analysis and Metrics:**

I'll use a simplified representation to analyze the examples instead of full grids. I'll focus on how each row transforms, representing the transformation as a mapping of input colors to output colors.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input Row 0: `[0, 5, 5]`  -> Output Row 0: `[3, 3, 3]`
    *   Input Row 1: `[5, 0, 5]`  -> Output Row 1: `[4, 4, 4]`
    *   Input Row 2: `[5, 5, 0]`  -> Output Row 2: `[2, 2, 2]`
    *   *Initial Observation*:  0 and 5 map to 3 in row 0, 4 in row 1, and 2 in row 2.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input Row 0: `[1, 1, 1]` -> Output Row 0: `[3, 3, 3]`
    *   Input Row 1: `[1, 1, 1]` -> Output Row 1: `[4, 4, 4]`
    *   Input Row 2: `[1, 1, 1]` -> Output Row 2: `[2, 2, 2]`
    *   *Observation*:  1 also maps to 3 in row 0, 4 in row 1, and 2 in row 2.

*   **Example 3:**
    *    Input Row 0: `[8, 8, 8]` -> Output Row 0: `[3, 3, 3]`
    *    Input Row 1: `[8, 8, 8]` -> Output Row 1: `[4, 4, 4]`
    *    Input Row 2: `[8, 8, 8]` -> Output Row 2: `[2, 2, 2]`
    *   *Observation*: 8 also maps to 3 in row 0, 4 in row 1, and 2 in row 2.

**In all examples the Input and Output grids are 3x3**

**YAML Facts:**

```yaml
task: color_mapping_by_row
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: 3x3
      elements: pixels
      pixel_values: integers (0-9) representing colors
transformations:
  - rule: "Each pixel's output color is determined solely by its row index."
  - row_0_mapping: "All input colors map to color 3 (green)."
  - row_1_mapping: "All input colors map to color 4 (yellow)."
  - row_2_mapping: "All input colors map to color 2 (red)."
```

**Natural Language Program:**

The transformation rule is as follows:

1.  The input and output grids are always 3x3.
2.  For each pixel in the input grid, the output color is determined *solely* by the pixel's row index:
    *   If the pixel is in row 0, the output color is 3 (green).
    *   If the pixel is in row 1, the output color is 4 (yellow).
    *   If the pixel is in row 2, the output color is 2 (red).
3.  The input pixel's color has *no* effect on the output color; only the row matters.
