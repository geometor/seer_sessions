Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a 3x3 input grid to a 3x3 output grid based on a row-dependent color mapping.
Input colors 0 and 5 are mapped to output colors 2, 3, and 4, where the specific mapping depends on the row number.
"""

import numpy as np

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.
    """
    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Iterate over rows, mapping colors per row.
    for i in range(rows):
       for j in range(cols):
        if i == 0:
            output_grid[i,j] = 3
        elif i == 1:
            output_grid[i,j] = 4
        elif i == 2:
            output_grid[i,j] = 2

    return output_grid
```

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and refine the natural language program.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code was overly simplistic and only considered a row-dependent color mapping, specifically targeting rows and setting every cell to a specific color. It completely ignored the input grid's actual pixel values and just imposed a fixed color scheme based on row number. The training set results clearly show this, as the predicted outputs don't match the expected outputs in terms of specific pixel colors. The input is not considered at all, so the output will always be that all rows are the same color.

Our strategy should be:

1.  **Analyze Input-Output Relationships:** Carefully examine how specific input pixel colors and positions relate to the output pixel colors and positions in *each* example.
2.  **Identify Conditional Rules:** Look for conditional rules (if-then-else) that govern the transformations, as the problem is not a simple, uniform mapping. The row does matter, but the color does too.
3. **Prioritize Simplicity, then complexity**: If all else fails, find a pattern in multiple examples.
4.  **Refine the Natural Language Program:** Update the program to accurately reflect the observed rules, incorporating conditions and specific color mappings.

**Example and Results Analysis:**

To better understand the transformation, I need to see the *exact* input and output grids for all the examples and analyze what the current code produces. I need to access the data, so i will use a tool to load the task and run some analysis.

```tool_code
import json
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np

task_file = Path('data/training/d515c4bd.json')
with open(task_file, 'r') as f:
    task = json.load(f)

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the observed rule.
    """
    # Initialize output grid with the same dimensions as the input.
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.zeros_like(input_grid)
    rows, cols = input_grid.shape
    
    # Iterate over rows, mapping colors per row.
    for i in range(rows):
       for j in range(cols):
        if i == 0:
            output_grid[i,j] = 3
        elif i == 1:
            output_grid[i,j] = 4
        elif i == 2:
            output_grid[i,j] = 2

    return output_grid.tolist()

def compare_grids(grid1, grid2):
     return np.array_equal(np.array(grid1), np.array(grid2))
    
results = {}
for i, example in enumerate(task['train']):
    input_grid = example['input']
    expected_output = example['output']
    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)    
    results[i] = {
      'correct': compare_grids(predicted_output, expected_output),
      'input': input_grid,
      'expected': expected_output,
      'predicted': predicted_output,
      }

print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
```
**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
