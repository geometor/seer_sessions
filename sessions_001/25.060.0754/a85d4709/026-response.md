The transformation rule can be described as follows:

1.  **Grid Structure:** The input and output grids are both 3x3.

2.  **Color Substitution:**  The program performs a specific color substitution:
    *   Gray (5) pixels in the input are replaced with Green (3) pixels in the output.
    *   White (0) pixels in the input are replaced with Yellow (4) pixels in the output.
    *   Blue (1) pixels in the input are not changed.

3.  **Pixel-wise Operation:** This substitution happens for every pixel in the input grid. The output grid's pixel at position (i, j) is determined solely by the color of the input grid's pixel at position (i, j).
