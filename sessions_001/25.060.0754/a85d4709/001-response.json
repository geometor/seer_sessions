            "text": "Okay, let's analyze this ARC task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers (representing colors) into another 3x3 grid of single-digit integers. The input grids consistently contain the value '5' (gray) and '0' (white), while the output grids feature a seemingly related set of colors, but never '5' or '0'. There appears to be a one-to-one mapping between the locations of '5's in the input and different non-'0' colors in the output. '0' in the input appears to always become a specific color in the output that's different from the colors created by the 5. The positioning of the non-zero and non-five colors is consistent with the position of the 5s in the inputs.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
