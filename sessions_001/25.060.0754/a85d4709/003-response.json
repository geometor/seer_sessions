The input grid contains only the values 0 and 5, while the output grid contains 2, 3, and 4. The spatial arrangement is preserved (3x3 to 3x3), suggesting a per-pixel transformation rather than a rearrangement or manipulation of larger structures. The transformation seems to be a mapping of input colors to output colors.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The ouput grid is composed of colors 2,3,4 - the input pixel on row 0 is mapped to color 3, row 1 maps to color 4 and row 2 maps to color 2.\n5. **Output:** The resulting 3x3 grid is the output.\n\nEssentially, the transformation appears to involve looking at a row at a time. Row 0 (all 0 except the top right corner) maps to 3, row 1 (all 0 except center) maps to 4 and row 2 (all 0 except the lower left) maps to 2.\n"
