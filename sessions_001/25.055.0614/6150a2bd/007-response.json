The colors are represented by single digits (0-9). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. It appears there's a rotation and a color inversion or mirroring involved. The positions of specific colors seem to be key to the transformation.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The top left, the center and the bottom right corner change places, the content of the bottom left corner becomes the top left corner.\n\nThis is a high-level program. The detailed color change operation needs further refinement, but this rotation and color changes is the main idea.\n"
