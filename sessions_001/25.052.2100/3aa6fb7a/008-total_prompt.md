1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels. These form distinct objects.
2.  **Object Properties:** For each object, determine if it's a 2x1 vertical bar or 2x2 square.
3.  **Transformation Rule:**

    *   For the 2x2 square: Change the color of the *bottom-left* pixel of the square from azure (8) to blue (1).

Okay, I'm in the dreamer role. Let's analyze the provided examples and results to refine our understanding of the transformation.

The previous code and natural language program were close but had some errors in execution, particularly in identifying *which* pixel within the identified azure shapes should turn blue. Let's break down a more accurate observation and create a revised natural language program:

**Revised Observations and Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Object Identification:** The core concept remains the same: we're looking for contiguous blocks (objects) of azure (8) pixels.

2.  **Object Classification:**  We need to distinguish between two specific shapes of azure objects:
    *   **2x1 Vertical Bar:**  Two azure pixels stacked vertically.
    *   **2x2 Square:** A square formed by four azure pixels.

3.  **Transformation Rule (Precise):** This is where the previous attempt had issues. Here's a more precise description:
    *   **2x1 Vertical Bar:** Examine the two pixels. Change the color of the *bottom* pixel of the bar from azure (8) to blue (1).
    *   **2x2 Square:** Examine the four pixels. Locate the corner of the square that is diagonally down and to the right - it's in the direction where both row and column indices increase. Change the color of the *top-left* pixel of the square from azure (8) to blue (1).

4. **No other shapes**: There are no transformations of objects other than the 2x1 Vertical Bar or the 2x2 square.

**Natural Language Program (Step-by-Step):**

1.  **Scan the input grid:** Find all groups of connected azure (8) pixels. Each group is an "object."

2.  **For each object:**
    *   **Determine its shape:** Is it a 2x1 vertical bar or a 2x2 square?  If it's neither of these, *ignore* it (no change).
    *   **If it's a 2x1 vertical bar:** Find the *bottom* azure pixel in the bar. Change its color to blue (1).
    *   **If it's a 2x2 square:** Find the *top-left* azure pixel in the square. Change its color to blue (1).

3. **All other Pixels**: Do not transform pixels that are not part of the described azure objects.

**Key Improvements and Clarifications:**

*   **Bottom vs. Top (Vertical Bar):** The critical error in the first example was changing the top pixel instead of the bottom one in the vertical bar. The revised program correctly identifies the bottom pixel.
*   **Top-left in square**: Similarly the critical error in the first and second example was failure to identify the top-left pixel of a square.
* **Ignore other objects**: We explicitly state to ignore other object types.

This revised natural language program should provide a more accurate and complete guide for the coder phase. It addresses the observed discrepancies in the previous execution.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
