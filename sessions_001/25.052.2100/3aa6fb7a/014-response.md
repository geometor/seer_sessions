# 1-3aa6fb7a • 014 • refine_code - CODE

Okay, I see the issue. The previous code was close but had a small error in how it determined the left/right half for the 2x1 bars. It was using `<=` which included an extra column when the width was an odd number. The core logic is correct, but the column comparison needs a slight adjustment.

Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

def find_objects(grid, color):
    """Finds contiguous objects of a specified color in the grid."""
    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)
    objects = []

    def dfs(row, col, current_object):
        """Depth-first search to find contiguous pixels."""
        if (
            row < 0
            or row >= grid.shape[0]
            or col < 0
            or col >= grid.shape[1]
            or visited[row, col]
            or grid[row, col] != color
        ):
            return
        visited[row, col] = True
        current_object.append((row, col))
        dfs(row + 1, col, current_object)
        dfs(row - 1, col, current_object)
        dfs(row, col + 1, current_object)
        dfs(row, col - 1, current_object)

    for row in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for col in range(grid.shape[1]):
            if grid[row, col] == color and not visited[row, col]:
                current_object = []
                dfs(row, col, current_object)
                objects.append(current_object)
    return objects

def classify_object(obj):
    """Classifies an object as a 2x1 bar or a 2x2 square or other."""
    rows = [p[0] for p in obj]
    cols = [p[1] for p in obj]
    height = max(rows) - min(rows) + 1
    width = max(cols) - min(cols) + 1

    if height == 2 and width == 1:
        return "2x1_bar"
    elif height == 2 and width == 2:
        return "2x2_square"
    else:
        return "other"


def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)
    # find objects
    azure_objects = find_objects(input_grid, 8)
    width = input_grid.shape[1]
    middle_column = width // 2


    # change output pixels
    for obj in azure_objects:
        object_type = classify_object(obj)

        if object_type == "2x1_bar":
            rows = [r for r, c in obj]
            cols = [c for r, c in obj]
            min_row = min(rows)
            max_row = max(rows)
            min_col = min(cols)

            if min_col < middle_column:  # Left half
                output_grid[min_row,min_col] = 1 #top
            else: # right half
                output_grid[max_row,min_col] = 1 # bottom


        elif object_type == "2x2_square":
             for row, col in obj:
                min_row = min(r for r, c in obj) # Find the top row
                min_col = min(c for r, c in obj) # Find the left-most column
                if row == min_row and col == min_col: # top left
                    output_grid[row,col] = 1


    return output_grid
```

The key change is in the `transform` function, within the `if object_type == "2x1_bar":` block:

-   `if min_col <= middle_column:` was changed to `if min_col < middle_column:`.

This ensures that the middle column is *not* included in the left half, resolving the discrepancy observed in the previous outputs. The rest of the logic remains the same and accurately reflects the natural language program.
