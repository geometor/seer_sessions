Okay, let's analyze the transformation between the input and output grids.

**YAML Observation:**

```yaml
observations:
  input_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical lines
        positions:
          - (1,1), (2,1)  # One line
          - (4,3), (5,3)  # Another line
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the remaining cells
  output_grid:
    size: 7x7
    objects:
      - color: 8 (azure)
        shape: two separate 2x1 vertical lines
        positions:
          - (1,1), (2,1)  # One line
          - (4,3), (5,3)  # Another line
      - color: 1 (blue)
        shape: single cells
        positions:
          - (1,2) # Next to first azure line
          - (4,4)   # Next to second azure line
      - color: 0 (white)
        shape: background
        positions: fills the remaining cells

```

**Natural Language Program (Transformation Rule):**

1.  **Identify Objects:** In the input grid, we have two distinct vertical lines of color 8 (azure). Each line is two cells high and one cell wide.

2.  **Observe Changes:** We see in output that the first azure shape maintained as is. And, a new blue pixel (color 1) appears immediately to the right of the top pixel of each azure line.

3. **Describe the Rule:**
    - Scan the input grid from the upper shape to the lower shape.
    - For each top pixel of an azure shape, identify their right-adjacent position, in order.
    - Add new pixel by drawing at these positions with blue(color 1).


```python
"""
The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Identify all vertical azure (color 8) lines that are 2x1 in the input grid.
2. For each identified line, place a blue (color 1) pixel to the immediate right of the top pixel of the line.

    """
    Find vertical lines of specified color, height, and width in the grid.
    """
    lines = []
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    for r in range(rows - height + 1):
        for c in range(cols - width + 1):
            if all(grid[r+i, c] == color for i in range(height)):
                lines.append((r, c))
    return lines

def transform(input_grid):
    """
    Transforms the input grid according to the specified rule:
    1. Find 2x1 vertical lines of azure color.
    2. Add one blue pixel at the upper-right of each of these lines
    """
    # Initialize output grid as a copy of the input grid
    output_grid = np.copy(input_grid)

    # Find all 2x1 vertical lines of color 8 (azure)
    azure_lines = find_vertical_lines(input_grid, 8, 2, 1)

    # For each azure line, place a blue pixel (color 1) to the right of the top pixel
    for line in azure_lines:
        r, c = line
        if c + 1 < output_grid.shape[1]:  # Check bounds
            output_grid[r, c + 1] = 1

    return output_grid

**Instructions**

- Describe in natural language the step-by-step transformation observed between the input and output grids.
- Focus on identifying objects, their properties (predicates), and the actions performed on them.
- Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.
