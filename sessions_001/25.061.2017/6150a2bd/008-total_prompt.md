**input:**
```
3 3 8
3 7 0
5 0 0
```

<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=192x192 at 0x70CF6FA40EE0>

**output:**
```
0 0 5
0 7 3
8 3 3
```

Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 3x3 grid of single-digit integers, each representing a color. The transformation seems to involve a rotation of the grid's contents. The colors/numbers themselves remain unchanged, only their positions within the grid are altered. It appears to be a counter-clockwise rotation.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 3x3
    elements: integers (0-9)
    properties:
      - color: determined by integer value

actions:
  - type: rotation
    direction: counter-clockwise
    degrees: 90

relationships:
  - element_positions: change according to rotation
  - element_values: remain constant
```


**Natural Language Program:**

The input grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The integer values (representing colors) within the grid maintain their original values, but their positions are updated based on the rotation.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
