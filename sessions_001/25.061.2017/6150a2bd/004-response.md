Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize on how to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a rotation transformation, specifically a 90-degree clockwise rotation, with an inversion of the vertical axis ordering at output. This works for the first example but fails on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't universally applicable to all examples. We need to discern a more general, or perhaps conditional, transformation rule that accounts for the variations observed in the training examples. The provided code is swapping dimensions, which should be considered when updating the observations and natural language program.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to how the objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) and their spatial relationships change.
2.  **Identify Potential Rules:** Based on the analysis, propose candidate transformation rules. These might involve rotation, reflection, translation, or other operations, potentially conditional on object properties or grid dimensions.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Formulate a precise natural language description of the observed or hypothesized transformation rule.
4.  **Metrics and Facts:** Gather metrics and generate a YAML block with facts, focusing on consistent patterns and exceptions, to inform step 3.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

I need to examine the shapes, and the results, in particular if they match between expected and predicted output.
