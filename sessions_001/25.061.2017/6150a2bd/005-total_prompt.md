Previous Code:
```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def transform(input_grid):
    rows = len(input_grid)
    cols = len(input_grid[0])
    # Corrected output grid initialization: dimensions are swapped
    output_grid = np.zeros((cols, rows), dtype=int)

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            output_grid[j][rows - 1 - i] = input_grid[i][j]

    return output_grid

def compare_grids(grid1: np.ndarray, grid2: np.ndarray) -> bool:
    """Compares two grids for equality."""
    return np.array_equal(grid1, grid2)

def calculate_metrics(task_examples):
    results = []
    for example in task_examples:
        input_grid = np.array(example['input'])
        expected_output_grid = np.array(example['output'])
        predicted_output_grid = transform(input_grid)
        is_correct = compare_grids(expected_output_grid, predicted_output_grid)

        results.append({
            'input_shape': input_grid.shape,
            'output_shape': predicted_output_grid.shape,
            'expected_output_shape': expected_output_grid.shape,
            'correct': is_correct

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the provided information and strategize on how to improve the natural language program and, consequently, the code.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code implements a rotation transformation, specifically a 90-degree clockwise rotation, with an inversion of the vertical axis ordering at output. This works for the first example but fails on others. The core issue is that the transformation rule isn't universally applicable to all examples. We need to discern a more general, or perhaps conditional, transformation rule that accounts for the variations observed in the training examples. The provided code is swapping dimensions, which should be considered when updating the observations and natural language program.

My strategy is as follows:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, paying close attention to how the objects (contiguous blocks of the same color) and their spatial relationships change.
2.  **Identify Potential Rules:** Based on the analysis, propose candidate transformation rules. These might involve rotation, reflection, translation, or other operations, potentially conditional on object properties or grid dimensions.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Formulate a precise natural language description of the observed or hypothesized transformation rule.
4.  **Metrics and Facts:** Gather metrics and generate a YAML block with facts, focusing on consistent patterns and exceptions, to inform step 3.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

I need to examine the shapes, and the results, in particular if they match between expected and predicted output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
