task_description: |
  The task involves rotating a 2D grid of colored pixels by 90 degrees clockwise. The input grid can have varying dimensions, and the output grid's dimensions are swapped relative to the input.  Each pixel in the input grid retains its color (represented by an integer) in the output grid.  The transformation is a simple rotation without any complex object interactions or manipulations.

observations:
  - type: rotation
    degrees: 90
    direction: clockwise
    input_objects:
      - description: 2D grid of pixels
        properties:
          - name: color
            values: integers from 0-9
          - name: dimensions
            values: rows and columns, variable
    output_objects:
      - description: 2D grid of pixels
        properties:
          - name: color
            values: integers from 0-9, same as input
          - name: dimensions
            values: columns and rows of input, swapped
