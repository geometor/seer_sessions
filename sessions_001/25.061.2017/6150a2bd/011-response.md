Okay, let's analyze the results of the previously generated code and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment:**

The initial hypothesis (90-degree counter-clockwise rotation) seems to hold for the training examples, but we should test it on the entire training set to ensure there is no hidden conditions or alternative explanations that were not taken into consideration. The strategy is to meticulously examine each input-output pair, verifying if the rotation rule applies universally. If discrepancies arise, we'll need to identify the specific conditions under which the rule fails and adjust the natural language program to incorporate those conditions.

**Metrics and Observations:**

I will use a loop to inspect all examples and results.

```tool_code
def display_grid(grid, title):
    color_map = {
        0: (238, 238, 238),  # white
        1: (30, 147, 255),  # blue
        2: (220, 50, 40),  # red
        3: (79, 204, 48),  # green
        4: (230, 200, 0),  # yellow
        5: (85, 85, 85),  # gray
        6: (229, 58, 163),  # magenta
        7: (230, 120, 20),  # orange
        8: (135, 216, 241),  # azure
        9: (146, 18, 49),  # maroon
    }
    
    print(title)
    if not grid:
        print("Empty Grid")
        return

    height = len(grid)
    width = len(grid[0]) if height > 0 else 0

    print(f"Dimensions: {width}x{height}")
    for row in grid:
        row_str = ""
        for cell in row:
            row_str += f"{cell:2d}"
        print(row_str)

# Access the 'train' examples from the current task context
train_examples = task["train"]

for i, example in enumerate(train_examples):
    input_grid = example['input']
    output_grid = example['output']
    print("-" *20)
    print(f"Example {i+1}:")
    display_grid(input_grid, 'Input')
    display_grid(output_grid, 'Output')
    
    predicted_output = transform(input_grid)  # Use the transform function
    display_grid(predicted_output, 'Predicted Output')

    if predicted_output == output_grid:
        print("Prediction: Correct")
    else:
        print("Prediction: Incorrect")
```
