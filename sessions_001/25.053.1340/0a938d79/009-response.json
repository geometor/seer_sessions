The input grid appears to primarily contain white (0) pixels, with a few isolated blue (1) and green (3) pixels. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, with a repeating pattern involving the blue and green pixels, while all other cells are white. The output grid is significantly different in size compared to the input.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

The horizontal pattern expands from the initial color, while the vertical replicates every horizontal colored pixel.\n"
