Transforms an input grid based on the presence and arrangement of non-white "seed" pixels. If seed pixels appear in different columns, the output grid is filled with alternating columns of the first two seed colors. If seed pixels are only in the same column or stacked in multiple rows, the output grid is created by copying rows containing seed pixels.

Here's an analysis of the provided examples and a plan to refine the natural language program and code:

**General Assessment:**

The current code and natural language program are based on a "seed pixel" concept, where non-white pixels trigger either a column-filling or row-copying behavior. The initial logic works for some simple cases but fails to generalize to the variety of scenarios presented in the training examples. The core issue is that the decision between column-filling and row-copying is too simplistic and doesn't account for the spatial relationships between seed pixels beyond just checking if they are in different columns.  Specifically, Example 3 shows a stacking of seed pixels across rows and subsequent duplication of the "seed pixel" rows. Example 4 adds the idea of copying an existing row downwards *multiple* times.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, noting *exactly* which pixels change and how their positions and colors relate to other pixels. Pay close attention to the conditions that lead to row duplication versus column filling.
2.  **Refine Seed Pixel Concept:** The "seed pixel" idea is valuable, but its definition and the rules associated with it need refinement. Consider these aspects:
    *   **Connectivity:** Are seed pixels always connected, or can they be isolated?
    *   **Color Patterns:** Do the colors of the seed pixels themselves matter, or is it only their position?
    *   **Directionality:** Does the transformation have a clear direction (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right)?
3.  **Iterative Program Update:**  Start by correcting the most obvious errors in the simplest examples, then incrementally adjust the natural language program and code to handle more complex cases. Test thoroughly after each change.
4. Consider the case where rows are copied downwards when the non-white pixels are vertically stacked in a column.
5. Consider special cases:
   - Empty row.
   - Completely white input.

**Example Metrics and Observations:**

Here is a more detailed analysis and data, based on the code execution results. Note that I am adding observations here that go beyond what the code *currently* does, as this is part of the "dreaming" phase.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Seed Pixels:** Find all non-white pixels in the input grid. These are the "seed pixels."

2.  **Determine Transformation Type Based on Seed Pixel Column Arrangement:**
    *   **Different Columns:** If seed pixels are found in *different* columns, perform a column fill.
        *   The fill colors are the colors of the first two seed pixels encountered.
        *   The fill starts from the column of the *leftmost* seed pixel.
        *   Columns are filled with the seed pixel colors, alternating between them.
    *   **Same Column or Stacked Vertically:** If all seed pixels are in the *same* column, or stacked within a single column:
        *   Find all rows containing the seed pixels.
        * Starting from the first seed pixel row, fill all the pixels in that row with the seed pixel's color.
        * Copy this row and the following rows downward until next non-white pixel is found, repeatedly.
        * For each subsequent row, copy that seed pixel row into the grid.

3.  **Handle Empty Input:** If there are no seed pixels (the input is all white), the output is identical to the input (an all-white grid).

4. **Handle All White Rows:**
   * If there are all white rows above or between the seed pixel rows, they should remain unchanged in the final output
   * If any white rows are found below the seed pixel rows, they should get copied with the seed pixel row.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
