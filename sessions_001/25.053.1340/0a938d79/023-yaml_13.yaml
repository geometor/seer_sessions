      Alternating colors 2 and 8 across the row, starting with 2.
      Each colored row is repeated, and there are no blank rows.
    errors: |
        The horizontal extension is only using first color.
        The entire pattern is of colored rows is repeated, with blank rows inserted, rather than just a single instance of color, blank row.

    errors: |
        The horizontal extension is incorrect, only first color of each row is used.
        There are blank lines inserted between colored rows, but the output shows no blank rows.
        The colored pattern should repeat.
