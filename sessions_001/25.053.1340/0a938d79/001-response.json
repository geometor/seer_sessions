The input grid contains a few isolated pixels of color 'red' (2) and 'azure' (8) on a background of 'white' (0). The output grid appears to be a checkerboard-like pattern, constructed using the initial positions of the 'red' and 'azure' pixels as a starting point. The sizes of the input and output are different.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"

These are the 'seed' pixels, which in this case are color 'red' (2) and 'azure' (8).\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** the number of rows are the same and add three columns at the start.\n3.  **Create Checkerboard:** Generate a new grid which has three extra columns at the start and fill it with the checkerboard pattern. Starting at the top-left corner (0,0) of this output use one seed color and extend and repeat its color down each column and across each row, alternating with the other color.\n4.  **Background:** Fill any remaining cells in the output grid with 'white' (0).\n\n"
