Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example, formatted as a report:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a transformation of a 2D grid of colored pixels. The input grid appears to primarily contain white (0) pixels, with a few isolated blue (1) and green (3) pixels. The output grid seems to be a modified version of the input, with a repeating pattern involving the blue and green pixels, while all other cells are white. The output grid is significantly different in size compared to the input.

**YAML Block - Facts:**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions:
        input: [7, 23]
        output: [7, 23]
      cell_values:
        input:  [0, 1, 3]
        output: [0, 1, 3]
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      colors:
        white: 0
        blue: 1
        green: 3
      locations:
        input_blue: [[0, 5]]
        input_green: [[6, 8]]
        output_blue: [[0, 5], [0, 11], [0, 17], [1,5] ... ]
        output_green: [[0, 8], [0, 14], [0, 20], [1,8] ... ]

actions:
  - type: pattern_generation
    description: Creates a repeating pattern of blue and green pixels.
    parameters:
      blue_spacing: 6 columns from the initial blue
      green_spacing: 6 columns from the initial green.
      pattern_repetition: repeats across columns and rows.

relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The output grid's pattern maintains relative vertical and horizontal positions of original colored pixels, repeating based on spacing of the input colors.

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the locations of the blue (1) and green (3) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Replicate** the input, but all cells that are not a 1 or 3 are changed to 0.
3.  **Horizontal Replication**: Starting from the original positions of the color:
      *   For every blue (1) pixel, create new blue pixels to the right at intervals of 6 columns, until the edge of the grid is reached.
      *   For every green (3) pixel, create new green pixels to the right at intervals of 6 columns until the end of the grid.
4. **Vertical Replication**:
      * Starting from every blue (1) pixel, create a vertical replication of blue pixels along the height of the grid.
      * Staring from every green (3) pixel, create a vertical replication of green pixels along the heigh of the grid.

In simpler terms: The transformation takes the initial positions of colored pixels (blue and green) and uses them as starting points to create a horizontally and vertically repeating pattern, keeping all other positions in the grid white. The horizontal pattern expands from the initial color, while the vertical replicates every horizontal colored pixel.
