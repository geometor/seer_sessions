Okay, here's my analysis of the provided example input-output pair:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves two grids: an input grid and an output grid. Both grids contain single-digit integer values (0-9), which represent different colors. The primary colors observed are white (0), red (2), and green (3). The input grid appears mostly white, with a single red pixel and a single green pixel located in seemingly arbitrary positions. The output grid shows a pattern where the red and green pixels from the input grid have been "extended" or "filled" into horizontal lines that repeat across the entire grid. The areas between repeated green and red lines seem to alternate.

**YAML Block - Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red, green]
      - red_pixel_location: [5,0]
      - green_pixel_location: [7,8]
      - dimensions: [22, 9]

  - name: output_grid
    type: grid
    properties:
      - colors: [white, red, green]
      - dimensions: [22, 9]

actions:
  - name: extend_color_horizontally
    description: Replaces all pixels in a row with the color of a specific pixel in that row.
  - name: repeat_color_line
    description: extend_color_horizontally for specific rows, and then repeat that through out the grid

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: "Replicate red and green pixels horizontally and create repeating blocks."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Key Pixels:** Locate the single red (2) pixel and the single green (3) pixel within the input grid. Note their original row indices.
2.  **Horizontal Extension:** For the row containing the red pixel, replace all pixel values in that row with red (2). Similarly, for the row containing the green pixel, replace all pixel values in that row with green (3).
3.  **Repeating Pattern:**
    *   Copy the red and green lines, interleaving a blank (white, value 0) line after each color line.
    *   Repeat the three lines created, the red line, then a white line, then a green line, then a white line, until the output_grid is filled.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
