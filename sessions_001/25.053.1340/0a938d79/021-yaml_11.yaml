example_1:
  input_shape: [10, 25]
  output_shape: [10, 25]
  input_colors: [0, 2, 8]
  output_colors: [0, 2, 8]
  colored_rows_input: [0, 9]
  colored_rows_output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
  notes: >
    Input has two rows with colors (2 and 8). The output extends
    these colors, alternating them across each row, and repeats the row pattern
    to fill the grid.

example_2:
  input_shape: [7, 23]
  output_shape: [7, 23]
  input_colors: [0, 1, 3]
  output_colors: [0, 1, 3]
  colored_rows_input: [0, 6]
  colored_rows_output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
  notes: >
    Input has two rows with colors (1 and 3). The output extends
    these colors in an alternating pattern across each row and repeats
    the pattern.

example_3:
  input_shape: [22, 9]
  output_shape: [22, 9]
  input_colors: [0, 2, 3]
  output_colors: [0, 2, 3]
  colored_rows_input: [5, 7]
  colored_rows_output: [5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21]
  notes: >
      Input has colors 2 and 3 on different rows. the correct behavior is to
      fill the row with the color, alternating with a blank row, and continue the pattern down
      the grid

example_4:
  input_shape: [24, 8]
  output_shape: [24, 8]
  input_colors: [0, 1, 4]
  output_colors: [0, 1, 4]
  colored_rows_input: [7, 11]
  colored_rows_output: [7,11,15,19,23]
  notes: >
      Input has colors 4 and 1 on different rows. the correct behavior is to
      fill the row with the color, alternating with a blank row, and continue the pattern down
      the grid
