        description: Find rows where each distinct, non-zero color appears for the first time.
        output: list of (row_index, row_content) tuples

  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      - rows: same as input_grid

      - cells: integers (0-9 representing colors)
    actions:
      - build_output_grid:
        description: Create output by repeating the sequence of identified rows from the input, maintaining the original row content.
        input: list of row_content from identify_rows_with_first_color
