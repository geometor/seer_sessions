            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined natural language program and supporting YAML documentation.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial code was based on the idea of identifying \"internal\" green pixels and recoloring them yellow. The definition of \"internal\" was based on orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. However, the test results across multiple examples show that this definition is too broad and doesn't accurately capture the transformation rule. Specifically:\n\n*   **Example 1:** The code failed to change two green pixels to yellow.\n*   **Example 2:** The code incorrectly changed a green pixel to yellow in row 6, column 3 and missed another one.\n*   **Example 3:** The code changed none of the green to yellow.\n*   **Example 4:** The code didn't change enough green pixels to yellow\n*   **Example 5:** The code change any of the green pixels to yellow.\n\nThe strategy to resolve these errors involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Re-examine Adjacency:** The current adjacency check (both orthogonal and diagonal) is not precise enough. We need to refine the condition under which a green pixel is considered \"internal\". It looks like a green pixel is converted to yellow if it is within a fully-enclosed shape.\n2.  **Connected Components:** Thinking in terms of connected components of green pixels, the transformation seems to target green pixels *inside* such connected components rather than those on the edges.\n3. **Refine detection logic**: Instead of just changing if surrounded, analyze whether or not the pixel is part of the \"inner\" green pixels.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\nLet's summarize the key metrics in a structured way:\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Pixels Off | Size Correct | Color Palette Correct | Correct Pixel Counts | Notes                                                                    |\n| :------ | :---------- | :----------- | :--------- | :----------- | :-------------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | (6, 6)      | (6, 6)       | 2          | True         | True                  | False                | Missed two internal green pixels.                                        |\n| 2       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | 2         | True         | True                  | False                | Incorrect yellow in row 6, missed a green pixel in row 4.           |\n| 3       | (10, 10)    | (10, 10)     | 9          | True         | True                  | False                | Missed several green pixels.                                              |\n| 4       | (10, 10)     | (10, 10)    | 6        | True          | True                |False                | Missed several green pixels.        |\n| 5       | (20, 20)    | (20, 20)     | 31       | True         | True                |  False                  | Didn't find any internal pixels        |\n\n**YAML Documentation (Facts)**\n```yaml\nobjects:\n  - id: green_regions\n    type: connected_component\n    color: green\n    properties:\n      - enclosed: boolean # Indicates if the region is fully surrounded by other pixels of the same color (or edge of grid)\n\nactions:\n  - type: recolor\n    target: green_regions\n    properties:\n      - condition: enclosed\n      - new_color: yellow\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Find all connected regions of green (3) pixels. A connected region is a group of green pixels where each pixel is orthogonally adjacent to at least one other pixel in the group.\n2.  **Determine Enclosure:** For each green region, determine if it is \"enclosed\". A green region is considered \"enclosed\" if *all* of its constituent pixels are: a) not on the edge of the grid, and, b) each green pixel that is on the border of the component touches another, different colored pixel.\n3.  **Recolor Internal Pixels:** Change the color of all pixels within enclosed green regions to yellow (4).\n\nEssentially, we are looking for green components that are fully contained, then find the \"inner\" pixels of those green components to recolor.\n"
