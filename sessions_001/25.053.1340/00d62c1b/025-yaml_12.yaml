objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: int # 0-9
      color: str # mapped from value
      position: (int, int) # row, column
    relationships:
      - adjacent_to: List[pixel] # pixels directly above, below, left, or right

actions:
  - name: change_color
    agent: system
    target: pixel
    precondition:
        - target.color == green
        - count_adjacent(target, green) == 4 # condition
        - count_adjacent(target, green, diagonal=True) in [4,5,6,7,8]
    postcondition:
      - target.value == 4
      - target.color == yellow
