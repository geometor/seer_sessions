Pixels are contiguous if they are connected horizontally, vertically, *or diagonally*.\n\n2.  **Determine Boundaries:** For each green region, identify its boundary pixels. A pixel is part of the boundary if *any* of its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) is:\n    *   A pixel of a different color.\n    *   Outside the bounds of the input grid.\n\n3.  **Change Inner Pixels to Yellow:** Iterate through all pixels within each green region.\n    *   If a pixel is green and *not* a boundary pixel (i.e., it's an \"inner\" pixel), change its color to yellow (color value 4).\n    *   If a pixel is green *and* is a boundary pixel, its color remains unchanged.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not part of a green region in the input grid should remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n5.  **Output:** The output is the modified grid.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_contiguous_regions(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds contiguous regions of a given color in the grid.\"\"\"\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    regions = []\n\n    def is_valid(x, y):\n        \"\"\"Checks if a coordinate is within the grid bounds.\"\"\"\n        return 0 <= x < grid.shape[0] and 0 <= y < grid.shape[1]\n\n    def dfs(x, y, current_region):\n        \"\"\"Performs Depth-First Search to find contiguous pixels.\"\"\"\n        if not is_valid(x, y) or visited[x, y] or grid[x, y] != color:\n            return\n\n        visited[x, y] = True\n        current_region.append((x, y))\n\n        # Explore adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right, and diagonals)\n        for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                    continue\n                dfs(x + dx, y + dy, current_region)\n\n    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            if grid[x, y] == color and not visited[x, y]:\n                current_region = []\n                dfs(x, y, current_region)\n                regions.append(current_region)\n    return regions\n\ndef is_boundary(grid, x, y, region):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a pixel is on the boundary of its region (including diagonals).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                continue\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if not (0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols):\n                return True  # Adjacent to grid boundary\n            if (nx, ny) not in region:\n                return True  # Adjacent to a pixel outside the region\n    return False\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output_grid\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n    # Find green regions\n    green_regions = find_contiguous_regions(input_grid, 3)\n\n    # Iterate through each green region and change inner green pixels to yellow\n    for region in green_regions:\n        for x, y in region:\n            if not is_boundary(output_grid, x, y, region):\n                output_grid[x, y] = 4\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n"
