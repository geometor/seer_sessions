The primary colors observed are white (0) and green (3). In the output, some green (3) pixels are changed to yellow (4). The transformation seems to be localized and focused on specific green pixels. It appears that internal, isolated green pixels that are surrounded by other green pixels are the targets for transformation.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

For each pixel, check if it meets the following conditions:\n    *   The pixel's color is green (value 3).\n    *   The pixel is completely surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right) by other green pixels. Diagonal direction is not important, but a green pixel will change to yellow if at least 4 green pixels are immediate neighbors.\n2.  **Change Color:** If a pixel meets all criteria (is a \"surrounded\" green pixel), change its value to 4 (yellow).\n3.  **Output:** The output grid is the result of applying these changes to the input grid. The core concept is identifying and recoloring internal green pixels that are fully enclosed by other green pixels.\n"
