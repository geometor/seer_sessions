observations:
  - task_id: 030
  - objects:
    - color: green (3)
      description: Connected regions of varying shapes and sizes.
      properties:
        - enclosed: Can form enclosed shapes, where "enclosed" means not touching the edges of the grid.
        - internal_pixels: Pixels within an enclosed green region that should be recolored.
    - color: yellow (4)
      description: Represents the fill color for internal pixels of enclosed green regions.
  - actions:
    - name: identify_regions
      description: Identifies connected regions of green pixels.
    - name: check_enclosure
      description: Determines if a green region is fully enclosed (does not touch the grid boundary).
    - name: identify_internal
      description:  Marks pixels within enclosed green regions for recoloring based on neighbor analysis.
    - name: recolor_pixels
      description: Changes the color of marked internal pixels from green to yellow.
  - transformation_summary: |
     The transformation identifies connected regions of green pixels. If a green region is enclosed (does not touch the edge of the grid), all pixels that are fully surrounded by other green pixels or the black border in the up, down, left and right directions, inside the region are changed to yellow.
