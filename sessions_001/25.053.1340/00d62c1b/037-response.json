            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined strategy.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe code correctly identifies contiguous green regions and attempts to distinguish between boundary and inner pixels. However, the `is_boundary` function has a flaw: it only checks directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right). It doesn't consider diagonal neighbors as part of the \"inside\" of a shape. This leads to incorrect classification of inner pixels, particularly in cases with diagonal connections within the green regions. The result is that pixels that should be turned yellow remain green.\n\nThe core strategy is correct:\n\n1.  **Find green regions.**\n2.  **Identify boundary pixels of each region.**\n3.  **Change non-boundary green pixels to yellow.**\n\nThe primary area for improvement is the accurate identification of boundary vs. inner pixels. We need to ensure that `is_boundary` correctly identifies *all* pixels on the outer edge of a shape.\n\n**Example Metrics and Analysis**\n\nHere, I am compiling some relevant observations from the results to help improve the code.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Two pixels are wrong. The yellow pixels expected in the output did not get updated.\n*   **Example 2:** Two pixels are wrong, again, the yellow pixels were missed.\n*   **Example 3:** Nine pixels missed. Several yellow pixels within the green areas failed to transform, especially where a diagonal connection exists.\n*   **Example 4:** Six pixels off. Missing yellows around diagonals, same issue as Example 3.\n*   **Example 5:** 31 pixels off. This example highlights the problem dramatically, particularly with large and complex shapes. It's clear the diagonal adjacency is the major failing.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n```yaml\ntask: 036\nobjects:\n  - id: green_regions\n    type: contiguous_region\n    color: green\n    properties:\n      boundary: pixels adjacent to non-green pixels (including diagonals)\n      inner: pixels not on the boundary\nactions:\n  - name: change_color\n    input: green_regions.inner\n    properties:\n      from_color: green\n      to_color: yellow\n  - name: identify_boundary_pixels\n    input: green_regions\n    output: green_regions.boundary\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (color value 3) pixels in the input grid. Pixels are considered contiguous if they are connected horizontally or vertically.\n\n2.  **Determine Boundaries:** For each identified green region, determine its boundary. A pixel is part of the boundary if it meets *either* of these conditions:\n    *   It is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a pixel of a different color.\n    * It is on the edge of the overall grid.\n\n3.  **Change Inner Pixels to Yellow:** Iterate through each pixel within each green region.\n    *   If a pixel is green and *not* on the boundary of its region (i.e., it's an \"inner\" pixel), change its color to yellow (color value 4).\n    * if a pixel is green *and* on the boundary of its region, it's color remains unchanged.\n\n4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not green in the input grid should remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n5.  **Output:** The output is the modified grid after applying these transformations.\n"
