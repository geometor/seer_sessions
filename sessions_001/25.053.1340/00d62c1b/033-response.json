The transformation seems to involve identifying regions of green pixels and, in some cases, changing some of those green pixels to \"yellow\" (4). The overall grid dimensions remain constant. The key seems to lie in determining *which* green pixels are changed to yellow. It's not a simple color swap of all green to yellow.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The rule for selecting *which* green pixels to change is not entirely clear from this single example, but it's not *all* green pixels. It appears that green regions maintain their general shape when adjacent to white regions.\n\n3.  **Preserve Other Pixels:** All pixels that are not green in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\n4. **Output:** The resulting grid, with the selected green pixels changed to yellow, is the output.\n\nThe core uncertainty is the precise rule for selecting which green pixels within a region are changed to yellow. The example does not show different configurations of contiguous groups. More examples would be needed to definitively establish the selection criteria, which I suspect relates to the specific geometry/topology of each contiguous green region, but I cannot currently confirm.\n"
