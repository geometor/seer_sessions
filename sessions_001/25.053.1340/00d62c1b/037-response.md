Okay, let's analyze the results of the provided code and develop a refined strategy.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The code correctly identifies contiguous green regions and attempts to distinguish between boundary and inner pixels. However, the `is_boundary` function has a flaw: it only checks directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, right). It doesn't consider diagonal neighbors as part of the "inside" of a shape. This leads to incorrect classification of inner pixels, particularly in cases with diagonal connections within the green regions. The result is that pixels that should be turned yellow remain green.

The core strategy is correct:

1.  **Find green regions.**
2.  **Identify boundary pixels of each region.**
3.  **Change non-boundary green pixels to yellow.**

The primary area for improvement is the accurate identification of boundary vs. inner pixels. We need to ensure that `is_boundary` correctly identifies *all* pixels on the outer edge of a shape.

**Example Metrics and Analysis**

Here, I am compiling some relevant observations from the results to help improve the code.

*   **Example 1:** Two pixels are wrong. The yellow pixels expected in the output did not get updated.
*   **Example 2:** Two pixels are wrong, again, the yellow pixels were missed.
*   **Example 3:** Nine pixels missed. Several yellow pixels within the green areas failed to transform, especially where a diagonal connection exists.
*   **Example 4:** Six pixels off. Missing yellows around diagonals, same issue as Example 3.
*   **Example 5:** 31 pixels off. This example highlights the problem dramatically, particularly with large and complex shapes. It's clear the diagonal adjacency is the major failing.

**YAML Fact Documentation**

```yaml
task: 036
objects:
  - id: green_regions
    type: contiguous_region
    color: green
    properties:
      boundary: pixels adjacent to non-green pixels (including diagonals)
      inner: pixels not on the boundary
actions:
  - name: change_color
    input: green_regions.inner
    properties:
      from_color: green
      to_color: yellow
  - name: identify_boundary_pixels
    input: green_regions
    output: green_regions.boundary
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Green Regions:** Locate all contiguous regions of green (color value 3) pixels in the input grid. Pixels are considered contiguous if they are connected horizontally or vertically.

2.  **Determine Boundaries:** For each identified green region, determine its boundary. A pixel is part of the boundary if it meets *either* of these conditions:
    *   It is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a pixel of a different color.
    * It is on the edge of the overall grid.

3.  **Change Inner Pixels to Yellow:** Iterate through each pixel within each green region.
    *   If a pixel is green and *not* on the boundary of its region (i.e., it's an "inner" pixel), change its color to yellow (color value 4).
    * if a pixel is green *and* on the boundary of its region, it's color remains unchanged.

4.  **Preserve Other Colors:** All pixels that are not green in the input grid should remain unchanged in the output grid.

5.  **Output:** The output is the modified grid after applying these transformations.
