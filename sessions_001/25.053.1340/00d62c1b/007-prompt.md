Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify** all contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels in the input grid.  A contiguous block is a set of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one other pixel in the same block.

2.  **Identify** the exterior and interior pixels within each green block:
    *   An **exterior** green pixel is part of the block and is adjacent to at least one pixel that is *not* part of the same green block (either a different color or the boundary of the grid).
    *   An **interior** green pixel is part of the block, and all of its directly adjacent pixels (up, down, left, and right) are *also* part of the same green block.

3.  **Change** all interior green pixels within each block to yellow (4).

4.  All other pixels in the grid remain **unchanged**.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
