      - { color: green, shape: 'L-shape', size: 4, interior_points: 0 }
      - {color: black, shape: grid, size: 36}
    transformations: >
      Two green pixels that should be yellow, but aren't.  The
      green regions are adjacent.

    objects:
        - {color: green, shape: irregular, size: 9, interior_points: 0, position: top-left, neighbors: [object_3, object_4]}

        - {color: black, shape: grid, size: 100}
    transformations: >
        Two green blocks. One large irregular one and one smaller L shape. The
        yellow interior points are not being calculated in the larger block.
    match: False
  - example_id: 3
    object_counts: { green: 16, yellow: 0, background: 84 }
    transformations: >
        Four green objects with some adjacent sides. The large contiguous block
        of green color is not considered as one object and the transformation
        does not result in any yellow pixels.
    match: False
  - example_id: 4
    object_counts: { green: 19, yellow: 0, background: 81 }
    transformations: >
        A single large irregular green region with no yellow pixels after transformation
    match: False
  - example_id: 5
    object_counts: { green: 35, yellow: 0, background: 365 }
    transformations: >
        Multiple green blocks. Some are individual pixels, others are lines and
        squares of various size.  The larger square shape at row 10, col 7 should
        have a large central region of yellow, but there are zero yellow pixels
        generated by the transformation.
    match: False
