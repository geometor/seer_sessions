The primary element is the green (3) pixels forming a connected shape. The transformation seems to involve identifying specific green pixels and changing their color to yellow (4). The surrounding white (0) pixels remain unchanged. The shape and size of the grid are also consistent between input and output.\n\n**YAML Fact Block:**\n\n"
