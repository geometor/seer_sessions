facts:
  - object: grid
    description: 2D array of pixels
    properties:
      - rows: 10
      - columns: 10
      - values: integers (0-9) representing colors

  - object: shape
    description: contiguous block of pixels of the same color
    properties:
      - color: 3 (green)
      - type: unknown, but possibly determined by connectivity

  - action: identify_shape
    description: locate the contiguous block of green (3) pixels.

  - action: identify_interior
    description: determine the 'interior' pixels of the identified shape.  Interior pixels are defined as those pixels completely surrounded by the shape's pixels horizontally and vertically, like a flood fill that stops at the border.
    properties:
      - criteria: 4-way connectivity (up, down, left, right) to other shape pixels

  - action: recolor_interior
    description: change the color of the identified interior pixels.
    properties:
      - from_color: 3 (green)
      - to_color: 4 (yellow)

  - relationship: input_output
    description: The output grid is derived from the input grid by applying the actions sequentially.
