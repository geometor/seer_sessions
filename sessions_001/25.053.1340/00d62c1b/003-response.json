            "text": "Here's an analysis of the provided information and a strategy for improving the transformation rule:\n\n**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial natural language program and the corresponding Python code are based on a simple rule: change a green pixel to yellow if it has exactly two green neighbors. However, the results on the training examples show that this rule is not consistently correct. There are errors in every case except, interestingly, that it seems to get the outline correct most of the time, and the size and color palette is always correct. The core issue seems to be related to how the neighbor counting affects interior pixels and perhaps some cascading changes.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Errors:** Carefully examine each example, focusing on the differences between the `Expected Output` and the `Transformed Output`. Pay close attention to the pixels that are incorrect, where are they relative to other green and other transformed pixels.\n2.  **Refine Neighbor Rule:** The current \"exactly two neighbors\" rule is clearly too simplistic. We need to incorporate the idea of how edges are working correctly, consider a \"contiguous block\" interpretation and the concept of inside vs outside.\n3.  **Consider Edge Cases:** Explicitly consider pixels at the edges and corners of the grid and objects. These often have unique behavior in grid transformations.\n4. **Iterate and Test:** After modifying the natural language program and the code, re-run the tests and repeat the analysis.\n\n**Metrics and Observations (YAML):**\n\n```yaml\nexamples:\n  - id: 1\n    correct: false\n    notes: |\n      The two center-most green pixels should change to yellow. The transformation\n      fails to change these pixels.\n  - id: 2\n    correct: false\n    notes: |\n      Only one pixel in the longer line of green pixels should change to yellow.\n      The transformation only changes one, but the wrong one.\n  - id: 3\n    correct: false\n    notes: |\n      Many interior pixels should change, most are wrong.\n  - id: 4\n    correct: false\n    notes: |\n        Many interior pixels should change, most are wrong. Also, the top row\n        of green should not all be changed.\n  - id: 5\n    correct: false\n    notes: |\n      Many interior pixels should change, most are wrong.\ngeneral:\n  - The output grid size is always correct.\n  - The output grid color palette is always correct (only 0, 3, and 4).\n  - The simple two-neighbor rule is incorrect for many cases.\n  - The rule seems to produce better results on outlines, but not the interior\n    of larger blocks of green.\n```\n\n**Revised Natural Language Program:**\n\n1.  **Identify** contiguous blocks of green (3) pixels.  A contiguous block is defined as a set of green pixels where each pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to at least one other pixel in the block.\n2. **Identify** the exterior and interior of the block\n    - Exterior green pixels are part of the block, but have fewer than four green neighbors.\n    - Interior green pixels are not exterior.\n3.  **Change** interior pixels to yellow (4).\n4. All other pixels are **unchanged**.\n"
