The most obvious visual feature is a large, irregular shape composed primarily of magenta (color 6) pixels, with internal regions of white (color 0). The transformation appears to involve a selective removal or replacement of these white (0) pixels. The surrounding pixels of other colors seems mostly unaffected. The overall shape outline of the magenta region is preserved. The changes of the position or structure of the white elements are consistent.\n\n**YAML Block of Facts:**\n\n"
