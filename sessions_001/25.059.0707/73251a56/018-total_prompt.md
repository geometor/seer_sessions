Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the premise of removing white pixels (0) within a "main shape" defined by the bounding box of all non-background colored pixels. This approach works for the first example but fails on others because:

1.  **Incorrect Assumption about "Main Shape":** The "main shape" isn't always defined by *all* non-background pixels. In some cases, there are clearly distinct shapes, and the rule applies only within a specific one.
2.  **Ignoring Other Colors:** The presence of other colors besides white within the relevant shape matters. The rule seems to be more nuanced than simply removing all white pixels.
3. **Background definition** The assumption that the background is 0 is incorrect.

The strategy to address these issues is:

1.  **Refine Shape Identification:** Instead of a single bounding box for all non-background pixels, we need a way to identify the *specific* shape relevant to the transformation. This may involve looking for connectivity, color patterns, or other distinguishing features.
2.  **Incorporate Color Context:** The rule should explicitly consider the colors present within the shape and how they interact with the white pixels.
3. **Determine actual background** Identify the actual color used for the background.

**Example Analysis and Metrics**
Here's a breakdown of each example, including metrics and observations, background color

Example 0:
```
Input:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 1 0 1 0 0]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Output:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Result:
[[0 0 0 0 0 0]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 1 1 1 0 0]
 [0 0 0 0 0 0]]
Correct: True
```
Background is 0, main shape defined by blue (1). White (0) pixels are removed within the shape.

Example 1:
```
Input:
[[5 5 5 5 5 5]
 [5 1 1 1 5 5]
 [5 1 0 1 5 5]
 [5 1 1 1 5 5]
 [5 5 5 5 5 5]]
Output:
[[5 5 5 5 5 5]
 [5 1 1 1 5 5]
 [5 1 1 1 5 5]
 [5 1 1 1 5 5]
 [5 5 5 5 5 5]]
Result:
[[5 5 5 5 5 5]
 [5 1 1 1 5 5]
 [5 1 1 1 5 5]
 [5 1 1 1 5 5]
 [5 5 5 5 5 5]]
Correct: True
```
Background is 5, main shape defined by blue (1). White (0) pixels are removed within the shape.

Example 2:
```
Input:
[[8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]
 [8 8 3 0 3 8 8]
 [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]]
Output:
[[8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]
 [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]
 [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]]

 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]
 [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]
 [8 8 3 3 3 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]
 [8 8 8 8 8 8 8]]
Correct: True
```
Background is 8, main shape defined by green (3). White (0) pixels are removed within the shape.

**YAML Facts**

```yaml
facts:
  - task: "Remove white pixels within a specific colored shape."
  - objects:
    - shape:
        description: "A contiguous block of pixels of a single, non-white, non-background color."
        properties:
          - color: "Varies (blue, green, etc. - not white or background)"
          - contiguity: "Pixels are directly adjacent (not diagonal)."
    - white_pixels:
        description: "Pixels with the value 0."
        properties:
            - color: "white (0)"
  - actions:
    - remove:
        target: "white_pixels"
        condition: "Within the identified 'shape'."
  - background:
    - color: "The most frequent value on the edges."
```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Background Color:** Determine the most frequent color along the edges of the input grid. This is the background color.
2.  **Identify the Target Shape:** Find contiguous blocks of non-white, non-background colored pixels.  There will only be one such shape in each input grid.
3.  **Remove White Pixels Inside the Shape:** Within the bounds of the identified shape, remove any white (0) pixels. "Removing" in this specific task is equivalent to keep them at 0 as background is a non-zero color.
4. Output is the modified grid.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
