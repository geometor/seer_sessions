"""
1. Identify Objects: Divide the input grid into distinct objects. An object is defined as a contiguous block of pixels of the same non-white color.
2. Iterate Through Objects: For each identified object:
    1. Search for magenta pixels within the object.
    2. If magenta pixels are present in the object, search for white pixels.
    3. Replace all white pixels found *within that object* with magenta.
3. Preserve Other Colors: Pixels that are not white and are within an object remain unchanged.
