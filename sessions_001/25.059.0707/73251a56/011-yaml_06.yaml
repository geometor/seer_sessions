facts:
  - observation: |
      The input grid contains pixels of various colors, including white (0).
      The output grid contains only the non-white pixels from the input grid.
  - object: |
      Non-white pixels are considered objects.
  - property: |
      The color of each non-white pixel is preserved.
  - action: |
      The white pixels are removed. The remaining non-white pixels form a 3x3 square.
  - dimensionality: |
      The input grid has variable dimensions (e.g., 9x9, 9x10, 10x10).
      The output grid always has dimensions 3x3.
  - constraint: |
      Only color 0 (white) pixels are removed.  All other colors are retained and their counts remain the same.
  - pattern: The output grid is always a 3x3 square containing all non-zero pixels of the input, regardless of input dimension or location
