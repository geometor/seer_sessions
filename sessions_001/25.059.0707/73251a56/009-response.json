The input and output grids have the same dimensions (21x21). The primary change seems to be the removal of certain pixels, specifically those with the color white (0). Other colors appear to remain in the same positions. The overall shape defined by the non-white pixels is preserved.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
