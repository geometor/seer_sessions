Okay, I've examined the input and output for the `train_2` example pair. Here's my analysis:

**Perception of Elements:**

The input appears to be a large grid (27x25) mostly filled with white pixels (0). There are two distinct regions:

1.  A large, irregular shape composed of green pixels (3) in the upper-middle part of the grid.
2.  A small 3x3 block of multi-colored pixels in the lower-left corner. This block contains the digits/colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9, as well as two white (0) pixels.

The output is a 3x3 grid containing only the non-white pixels from the small multi-colored block in the input, maintaining their relative positions. The position of the smaller box inside the bigger box appears related.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - id: grid_large
    type: grid
    dimensions: [27, 25]
    elements:
      - value: 0
        color: white
        role: background
      - value: 3
        color: green
        role: shape_1
      - value: [1,2,4,6,7,8,9]
        color: [blue, red, yellow, magenta, orange, azure, maroon ]
        role: shape_2

  - id: grid_small
    type: grid
    dimensions: [3, 3]
    elements:
        - value: [1,2,4,6,7,8,9]
          color: [blue, red, yellow, magenta, orange, azure, maroon]
          role: data

relationships:
  - type: contains
    from: grid_large
    to: grid_small
    details: "grid_small is a sub-region of grid_large"
  - type: position
    from: grid_small
    details: "lower-left corner of grid_large, based on input image; could also say that it copies and removes the background."

actions:
  - type: extract
    agent: system
    input: grid_large
    details: "Extract the 3x3 sub-region (shape_2) from the larger grid, excluding the white/0 background pixels within shape_2."
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify a 3x3 sub-grid within the larger input grid. This sub-grid is positioned where we find non-white pixels within a 3x3 block.
2.  Extract the pixels within this 3x3 sub-grid.
3.  Exclude the white/background (value 0) pixels from the extracted subgrid.
4.  Output the non-white pixels as a new 3x3 grid, preserving the colors and relative positions.

In simpler terms: Find the 3x3 block of colored pixels. Copy it, but remove any white pixels, leaving only the colored pixels in their original positions within the 3x3 output.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
