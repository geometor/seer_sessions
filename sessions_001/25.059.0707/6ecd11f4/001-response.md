Okay, here's my analysis of the provided examples, focusing on perception, documented facts, and a natural language program describing the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves two main components:

1.  **A Large Input Grid:** A 2D array of colored pixels (represented by numbers 0-9).  Most of the grid is filled with 0 (white), but there are distinct shapes formed by contiguous blocks of other colors.
2.  **A Small Output Grid:** A smaller 2D array, seemingly derived from a specific region within the larger input grid. This region appears to be a consistently sized, non-white, dense block of pixels near the bottom. The size might vary.

The core transformation seems to be an extraction or "cropping" of a specific colored rectangular region from the larger input grid, and using this sub-grid as the output. The extracted area is characterized by not including white space (0s).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**



```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - size: variable (large)
      - description: Contains a larger, mostly white grid with colored shapes.
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D_array
    properties:
      - colors: [0-9]
      - size: variable (small)
      - description: Represents a cropped section of the input_grid.
  - relationship:
      - input_grid CONTAINS output_grid
  - action: extract_subgrid
    description: Identifies and extracts a non-white rectangular subgrid from the input_grid.
    parameters:
        - location: bottom_area # The location to look within the large grid is near the bottom
        - criterion: non_white_contiguous # Find a dense, non-white block.
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Locate Target Region:** Examine the input grid, specifically focusing on the lower portion.
2.  **Identify Non-White Block:** Find a rectangular block of non-white (non-zero) pixels. This block should be contiguous (all pixels connected). It appears there's only one such "dense" block of this nature present in each example.
3. **Determine Boundaries:** Determine rows and columns of the rectangular block.
4.  **Extract Subgrid:** Create a new, smaller grid (the output grid) consisting of *only* the pixels within the identified rectangular block.
5. **Output:** The output grid should contain exactly and only values inside the identified rectangle, without including surrounding white space.

In simpler terms, the transformation "crops out" the smallest rectangle of non-white pixels near the bottom of the input grid and presents this rectangle as the output.
