            "text": "Here's an analysis of the training set results and a revised natural language program:\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial strategy was mostly correct in identifying the multicolored rectangle and subsampling it. However, the adjacency check for azure pixels needs refinement, and the handling of edge cases (where the subsampling goes out of bounds of the multicolored rectangle) must be made more robust, especially for varying sizes of multicolored blocks. Also, the assumption that the multi-colored rectangle is always in the lower-right corner is not correct, it can vary in location within the input grid.\n\nThe strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Refine Adjacency Check:** The original code's adjacency check had an issue - it was looking at diagonals. The updated code will only consider direct neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n2.  **Robust Boundary Handling:** Ensure the code correctly handles cases where the 2x2 sampling goes beyond the bounds of the identified multicolored rectangle. The sample size must be restricted to the actual boundaries of the identified rectangle.\n3. **Generalized Location**: The multi-colored object can appear anywhere in the grid.\n\n**Example Metrics and Results**\n\nTo understand the errors, I will describe the results of the current `transform` function, and then provide a revised version.\n\n| Example | Input Shape | Output Shape | Multicolored Rectangle Found | Subsampling Correct | Azure Rule Correct | Overall Result | Notes                                     |\n|---------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | (19, 23)    | (4, 4)       | Yes                         | Yes                  | Yes                | Correct        | Initial successful case.                   |\n| 2       | (20, 24)    | (4, 4)       | Yes                         | Yes                  | No                 | Incorrect      | Azure rule application is incorrect.    |\n| 3       | (13, 16)    | (4, 4)      | Yes                         | No                  | Yes                | Incorrect        | The color selection is not correct |\n| 4       | (21, 18)    |(4,4)        | Yes                         | No                 | No                 | Incorrect        | The color selection is not correct  and azure rule failed|\n| 5       | (25, 18)    | (4,4)      | Yes                       | No                 | No           | Incorrect    | the colored object is only 3x3 - bounds issue     |\n\n**YAML Fact Block**\n\n```yaml\nfacts:\n  - object_type: grid\n    description: 2D array of color values (0-9)\n  - object_type: multicolored_rectangle\n    description: A rectangular region within the grid containing multiple colors (not white or azure).\n    properties:\n      - location: Varies within the input grid.\n      - size: Varies, but the subsampling targets a maximum 4x4 region from the object.\n  - object_type: subsampled_grid\n    description: A 4x4 grid extracted from the multicolored rectangle.\n    properties:\n      - size: 4x4\n      - values: Derived from the multicolored rectangle, with potential modifications based on azure adjacency.\n  - action: subsample\n    description: Extract a 4x4 portion of the multicolored region using a 2x2 pixel selection\n  - action: adjacency_check\n    description: Check if cells adjacent to the multicolored rectangle are azure.\n  - rule: azure_modification\n    description: If a cell adjacent to the selected pixel is azure, the corresponding output pixel is set to white (0).\n```\n\n**Natural Language Program**\n\n1.  **Identify Target:** Locate the multicolored rectangular block of pixels in the input grid. This block contains colors other than white (0) and azure (8).\n2.  **Determine Dimensions and Starting Point:** Find the top-left (min\\_row, min\\_col) and bottom-right (max\\_row, max\\_col) coordinates of the multicolored rectangle.\n3.  **Subsample:** Extract, at most, a 4x4 grid from the multicolored block, starting from the top-left. Select every other pixel by both row and column, (step of 2 in row and column) using the top-left corner of the identified region as the origin.\n4.   **Bounding Box**: If the multi-colored object dimensions are smaller than the sampling grid, restrict the sample to those boundaries\n5.  **Special Color Rule:** For each selected pixel in the multicolored block *before* subsampling occurs:\n    *   Check for direct adjacency (up, down, left, or right) to an azure (8) pixel in the *original* input grid.\n    *   If an azure pixel is directly adjacent, change the corresponding pixel in the *subsampled* 4x4 output grid to white (0).\n6. **Output:** If subsampling goes out of bounds for the multi-colored object, fill those values in the 4x4 output grid with 0.\n\n"
