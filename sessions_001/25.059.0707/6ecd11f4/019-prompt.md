Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify Target:** Locate the multicolored rectangular block of pixels in the input grid. This block contains colors other than white (0) and azure (8).
2.  **Determine Dimensions and Starting Point:** Find the top-left (min_row, min_col) and bottom-right (max_row, max_col) coordinates of the multicolored rectangle.
3.  **Subsample:** Extract, at most, a 4x4 grid from the multicolored block, starting from the top-left. Select every other pixel by both row and column, (step of 2 in row and column) using the top-left corner of the identified region as the origin.
4.   **Bounding Box**: If the multi-colored object dimensions are smaller than the sampling grid, restrict the sample to those boundaries
5.  **Special Color Rule:** For each selected pixel in the multicolored block *before* subsampling occurs:
    *   Check for direct adjacency (up, down, left, or right) to an azure (8) pixel in the *original* input grid.
    *   If an azure pixel is directly adjacent, change the corresponding pixel in the *subsampled* 4x4 output grid to white (0).
6. **Output:** If subsampling goes out of bounds for the multi-colored object, fill those values in the 4x4 output grid with 0.

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
