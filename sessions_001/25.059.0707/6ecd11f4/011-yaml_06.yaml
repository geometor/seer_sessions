facts:
  - example_set: "training"
  - observation: "Input grids contain 3x3 subgrids of non-white pixels."
  - observation: "White pixels (value 0) within the 3x3 subgrids are removed in the output."
  - observation: "Non-white pixels within the 3x3 subgrids retain their original positions relative to the subgrid within the 3x3 output."
  - observation: "The output grid is always 3x3."
  - observation: "There can be more than one 3x3 subgrid of unique color."
  - action: "Locate 3x3 subgrid(s)."
  - action: "Copy non-white pixels from subgrid(s) to a 3x3 output grid, maintaining relative position."
  - action: "Remove white pixels."
