Okay, I'm ready to analyze the provided input-output example and discern the transformation logic. Here's my breakdown:

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Grid:** The input and output are both 20x20 grids.
*   **Colors:** The grids contain pixels of colors: white (0), azure (8), and maroon (9).
*   **Shapes:** There are isolated azure (8) pixels and a connected structure of maroon (9) pixels. The maroon structure appears to be some kind of irregular shape.
*    **Changes**:It appears as if azure(8) pixels have been inserted in some places, changing.

**YAML Documentation of Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 20x20
    elements: pixels

  - type: pixel
    properties:
      color:
        values: [white, azure, maroon]
      coordinates: [row, column]

  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: azure
      description: isolated pixels

  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: maroon
      description: connected, irregular shape
      
actions:
 - type: insert
   description: add azure pixels within and around the maroon shape

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: pixels of the same or different colors can be adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the existing azure (8) pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify** the maroon (9) shape in the input grid.
3.  **Maintain** the current position of existing azure pixels.
4.  **Propagate** azure (8) into all white(0) pixels that are within the bounding box of the maroon shape.
5. **Propagate** single row of azure (8) vertically downwards until the edge of the grid, originating from the bottom edge of the bounding box of the maroon shape.
6.  If there any azure pixels with the area described in 4 and 5, overwrite them, otherwise just fill the empty space.

Essentially, the transformation seems to be to add azure on and around the maroon shape, and keep the azure pixels where there were before.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
