<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=3968x2640 at 0x7A43F5EEDBD0>Okay, let's analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where each cell contains a single-digit integer representing a color. There are distinct objects formed by contiguous blocks of the same color. The transformation seems to involve altering specific colored objects and potentially their positions or interactions. The background is consistently color 0 (white) and remains largely unchanged.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
facts:
  - objects:
    - color: 8 (azure)
      shape: irregular, scattered
      initial_state: present in input
      final_state:  present, vertically extended or added in the output
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: "arrow-like" structure pointing up
      initial_state: present in the center in input
      final_state: present in output, potentially extended downwards with color 8
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: irregular, scattered.
      initial_state: present
      final_state: might combine with object of color 7
    - color: 7 (orange)
      shape: "arrow-like"
      initial_state: present below object with color 2
      final_state: present in output, potentially extended downwards with color 2.
    - color: 3 (green)
    - color: 4 (yellow)

  - actions:
      - extend:
          - color: 8
            direction: vertical
            condition: extends or replaces the main body of color 9 objects.
          - color: 2
            direction: vertical
            condition: extends or replaces the body of 7 color objects
          - color: 3
            direction: vertical
            condition: extends color 3 objects.

  - relationships:
    - color_8_9: Color 8 appears to fill/extend the vertical space occupied by the color 9 object downwards.
    - color 2 and 7: seems to follow the same transformation rule of 8 and 9.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all objects, defined as contiguous blocks of pixels of the same color (excluding 0, the background). Focus on objects of colors 8 (azure), 9 (maroon), 2(red), 7(orange), 3(green), and 4(yellow).

2.  **Extend/Replace:**
    *   If there's a "maroon" (color 9) object. Extend color 8 (azure) downwards, starting from every color 8 in the original and replacing every 9 by an 8.
    *  If there's a "red" (color 2) object. Extend it with color 2 (red) downwards, starting from every color 2 in the original and replacing every 7 by 2.
    * If there's a "green" (color 3) object that is not adjacent with a color 4. Extend the color 3 downwards. If a color 3 pixel has adjacent color 4, replace color 3 with color 4 and preserve color 4.

3.  **Preserve Background:** The white background (color 0) remains unchanged.

4. **Other colors**: copy them to the output

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
