      final_state:  present, vertically extended or added in the output
    - color: 9 (maroon)
      shape: "arrow-like" structure pointing up
      initial_state: present in the center in input
      final_state: present in output, potentially extended downwards with color 8
    - color: 2 (red)
      shape: irregular, scattered.
      initial_state: present
      final_state: might combine with object of color 7
    - color: 7 (orange)
      shape: "arrow-like"

          - color: 2
            direction: vertical
            condition: extends or replaces the body of 7 color objects
