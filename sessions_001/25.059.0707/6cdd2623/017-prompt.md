Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Isolate Azure Pixels:** Identify all pixels with the color azure (8) in the input grid.
2.  **Discard Other Colors:** Remove all pixels that are not azure, setting their value to white (0).
3.  **Form Horizontal Line:** Create a horizontal line of azure pixels across the 11th row of the output grid.
4. **Form Vertical Line**: Create a vertical line of azure pixels from top to bottom in the middle of the grid(column 13).
5.  **Combine:** Combine horizontal line and vertical line.
"""

def transform(input_grid):
    """Transforms the input grid by keeping only azure pixels and arranging them in a cross shape."""

    # Initialize output grid with all white pixels (0)

Train Set Results:

**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
