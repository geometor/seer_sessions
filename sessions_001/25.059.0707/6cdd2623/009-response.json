The input grid contains a seemingly random distribution of white (0), blue (1), red (2), and azure (8) pixels. The output grid retains only the red (2) pixels from the input, but expands them to fill the entire row they originally appeared in. All other pixels become white (0).\n\n**YAML Documentation:**\n\n"
