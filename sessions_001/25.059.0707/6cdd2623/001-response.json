The input grids contain various colors, while the output grids seem to simplify these into a single color, often forming a cross-like shape or, in some cases, a filled row. The key seems to be identifying a specific color that dictates the transformation. It is not simply copying all occurrences of one color, but rather using one color as an \"instruction\" to overwrite all or part of the grid.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"
