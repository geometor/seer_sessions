Previous Code:
```python
"""
1.  **Identify the Single Green Pixel:** Find the *single* pixel in the input grid that has the color value 3 (green). Note its row and column indices.
2.  **Draw Horizontal Line:** Draw a horizontal line across the entire grid, using color 3 (green), at the row index found in step 1.
3.  **Draw Vertical Line:** Draw a vertical line down the entire grid, using color 3 (green), at the column index found in step 1.
4.  **Background:** The rest of the grid should consist of pixels with color white(0).

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
