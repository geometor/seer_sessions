Previous Code:
```python
"""
Transforms a grid of pixels, changing gray (5) pixels to red (2), green (3), or blue (1) based on their spatial arrangement.

1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all contiguous blocks of gray (5) pixels.
2.  **Determine New Color:** For each gray object:
    *   If the shape is a "horizontal line segment" (3 or more gray pixels in a row), change its color to red (2).
    *   If the shape is a "vertical line segment" (two gray pixels, one on top of each other) change its color to blue (1).
    *   If the shape is a square (3x3), change its color to green(3)
    * If shape is a single pixel. determine the color by checking which is the closest colored line and applying that same color.
3.  **Apply Transformation:** Replace the gray (5) pixels of each object with its determined new color.
4. **Output:** All pixels retain original value except where gray pixels have been transformed.

Train Set Results:
**INSTRUCTIONS**

The code above was generated based on observations from the first training
example

we have tested the transform function on each of the task example inputs and
compared with the expected output

review each of the examples provided and the results and consider how the
natural language program should be updated to accommodate this new knowledge

respond with the following deliverables:

- general assessment of the information provided and strategy for resolving the
  errors
- gather metrics about each of the examples and results - use code_execution to
  develop accurate reports on your assumptions
- a YAML block documenting facts - Focus on identifying objects, their properties, and the actions performed on them.
- a natural language program - Be as clear and concise as possible, providing a complete description of the transformation rule.



your responses should be considered as information in a report - not a
conversation
