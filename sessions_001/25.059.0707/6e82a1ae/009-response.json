The transformation seems to involve changing the gray pixels to different colors based on their spatial arrangement. I see red (2), green (3), and blue (1) appearing in the output where the gray pixels were. It appears a core concept is object recognition based upon the arrangement of pixels.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"

These are our input shapes.\n\n2.  **Determine New Color:** For each gray shape, determine its new color based on the following rules:\n    *   If the shape is a \"horizontal line segment\" (3 or more gray pixels in a row), change to red (2).\n    *   If a pixel is on its own, check which color horizontal segment is closest. Assign pixel the value of segment color plus 1. If blue or red is closest at the same distance, choose the blue.\n    * If shape is a 2x1, the color is blue (1).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** Replace the gray (5) pixels of each shape with the determined new color.\n\n4.  **Output:** all white (0) remains unchanged.\n"
