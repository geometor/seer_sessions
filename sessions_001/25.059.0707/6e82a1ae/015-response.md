Okay, let's analyze this input-output pair.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a 10x10 grid. The input grid contains gray (5) pixels, some of which form connected shapes. The output grid seems to have a one-to-one correspondence with the gray shapes in the input, but the gray pixels are replaced with different colors (blue=1, green=3, red=2), and each connected gray shape seems to correspond to a distinct color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
facts:
  - type: grid
    dimensions: 10x10
    elements:
      - color: gray (5)
        role: input_object
      - color: blue (1)
        role: output_object
      - color: green (3)
        role: output_object
      - color: red (2)
        role: output_object
      - color: white(0)
        role: background
  - observation: "Input grid has multiple disconnected gray objects."
  - observation: "Output grid has objects of same shape in same locations as input."
  - observation: "Each disconnected grey shapes matches to new color"
  - relationship: "one-to-one mapping between input gray objects and output colored objects"
  - action: "replace color of grey objects"
  - constraint: "background is not transformed"
```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** all distinct, contiguous groups of gray (5) pixels in the input grid. These are our input objects.
2.  **For each** identified gray object:
    *   Assign a unique color based on the object (e.g., blue=1, green=3 and red=2)
    *   **Replace** all gray pixels within that object with that object's assigned color.
3.  Leave all non-gray pixels (background, value 0) unchanged.

In simple words, the transformation identifies each gray object and replaces the set of pixels for the entire object by another color, so that all the pixels of that object have that color. The replacement color appears to be different for each object.
