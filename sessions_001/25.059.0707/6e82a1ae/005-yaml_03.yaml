    Gray pixels are treated as individual objects whose transformation depends on location.
    White pixels remain unchanged.

example_2:
  input_colors: [5, 7]
  output_colors: [1, 7]
  color_changes:
    5: [1] # Gray changes to blue
  object_observations: |
    Gray pixels are treated as individual objects, all transforming to blue.
    Orange pixels remain unchanged.

example_3:
  input_colors: [4, 5]
  output_colors: [4, 2]
  color_changes:
    5: [2] # Gray changes to red
  object_observations: |
      Gray pixels are treated as individual objects, all transforming to red.
      Yellow pixels are unchanged.
