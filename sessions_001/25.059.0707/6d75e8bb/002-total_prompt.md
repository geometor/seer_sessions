<PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=1792x1872 at 0x7A43FD925C50>Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output examples, formatted as requested:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves 2D grids where cells have one of two colors: azure (8) or white (0) in the input, and red (2), azure (8), or white (0) in the output. The primary element appears to be contiguous regions of azure-colored pixels within the input grid. The transformation seems to involve selectively changing some of the azure pixels to red, specifically focusing on enclosed or "interior" azure pixels. The output maintains the overall shape and structure of the azure regions but "fills in" certain areas with red.

**YAML Fact Block:**


```yaml
facts:
  - object: input_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: azure (8)
  - object: output_grid
    type: 2D array
    elements:
      - color: white (0)
      - color: azure (8)
      - color: red (2)
  - observation: azure_regions_in_input
    description: Contiguous blocks of azure (8) pixels form distinct shapes or regions.
  - observation: output_modifies_input
    description: The output grid retains the overall structure of the input grid's azure regions.
  - observation: color_change
    description: Some azure (8) pixels in the input become red (2) in the output.
  - relationship: interior_pixels
    description:  The azure pixels that change to red appear to be those 'inside' the azure regions, not on the edges/perimeter.
  - relationship: perimeter_pixels
    description: azure pixels that form the outer boundary of shapes, or edges, remain azure.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Locate all contiguous blocks (shapes) of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Identify interior pixels:** within each azure region, check the neighboring pixels
3.  **Change color of Interior Pixels:** Change the color of interior pixels to red(2).
4. **Preserve the Perimeter:** Keep pixels on the boundary of the shapes azure (8)
5.  **Retain White Pixels:** White (0) pixels in the input remain unchanged in the output.

In essence, the transformation "fills in" the internal areas of azure regions with red, leaving the outermost azure pixels (the border or outline) unchanged, and the remaining white space is kept.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
