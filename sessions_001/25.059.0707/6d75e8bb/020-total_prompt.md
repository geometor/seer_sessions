Previous Code:
```python
"""
The azure shape is modified by changing some of its azure pixels to red.
The change starts from the left edge of an indentation.
If an azure pixel has a white pixel on it's immediate left,
the recoloring to red will begin and proceed leftward. The recoloring stops when the left most azure
pixel of that extent is reached.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the generated code focused on a specific pattern: changing azure pixels to red based on the presence of a white pixel to their immediate left. This rule works for the first training example but fails to generalize to the others. The core issue is that the transformation rule is too narrow and doesn't capture the broader concept. It looks like there is a more general shape transformation happening, replacing a portion of a larger shape with a smaller one, and it's all based on adjacency, not a specific trigger color. The other examples highlight more complexity, so we need to focus on adjacency of pixels.

My strategy will involve the following steps:

1.  **Detailed Example Analysis:** Carefully examine each input-output pair, focusing on identifying the connected regions of azure and how they change.
2.  **Object Identification**: Identify the azure objects and record their relevant properties.
3.  **Action Identification**: Discern the action sequence for each object and how it relates to adjacency.
4.  **Revised Natural Language Program:** Rewrite the natural language program to describe a general rule that applies to all provided cases.
5. use code execution to gain metrics, especially related to adjacency

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

To get accurate metrics, I'll use `code_execution` to analyze the grids. I'll define helper functions in a `plan` section to find and analyze objects in the grid.

```python
def get_object_coords(grid, color):
    """Returns a list of (row, col) coordinates for the given color."""
    return list(zip(*np.where(grid == color)))

def get_adjacent_coords(grid, coord):
    r, c = coord
    rows, cols = grid.shape
    adjacent = []
    for dr, dc in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            adjacent.append((nr, nc))
    return adjacent

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    azure_coords_in = get_object_coords(input_grid, 8)
    azure_coords_out = get_object_coords(output_grid, 8)
    red_coords_out = get_object_coords(output_grid, 2)

    print(f"Input Azure Coords: {azure_coords_in}")
    print(f"Output Azure Coords: {azure_coords_out}")
    print(f"Output Red Coords: {red_coords_out}")

    for coord in azure_coords_in:
      adj_in = get_adjacent_coords(input_grid, coord)
      print(f"adj_in: {coord} : {adj_in}")
    for coord in azure_coords_out:
      adj_out = get_adjacent_coords(output_grid, coord)
      print(f"adj_out: {coord} : {adj_out}")
    for coord in red_coords_out:
      adj_red = get_adjacent_coords(output_grid, coord)
      print(f"adj_red: {coord} : {adj_red}")

import numpy as np
#task.train[0].input_grid
#task.train[0].output_grid
#task.train[1].input_grid
#task.train[1].output_grid
#task.train[2].input_grid
task = task.train[2].output_grid

analyze_example(task.train[2].input_grid, task)
#analyze_example(task.train[1].input_grid, task.train[1].output_grid)
#analyze_example(task.train[2].input_grid, task.train[2].output_grid)

```

**YAML Fact Block**

```yaml
observations:
  - example_1:
      input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: irregular, with indentations
          pixels_changed: Leftmost azure pixels within indentations change to red.
          adjacent_colors_before: white to the left of changing pixels
      output_objects:
        - color: red
          shape: fills indentation, contiguous
        - color: azure
          shape: remains of original azure, outer part
  - example_2:
      input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: Rectangular block with inward steps.
          pixels_changed:  The inner most pixels where the steps inward occur are changed to red.
          adjacent_colors_before: Not relevant.
      output_objects:
        - color: red
          shape: fills the "stepped" area, contiguous
        - color: azure
          shape: remaining parts of original azure block.
  - example_3:
    input_objects:
        - color: azure
          shape: complex with multiple sections and protrusions.
          pixels_changed: Pixels within protrusions where the change in width begins.
          adjacent_colors_before: Not relevant.
    output_objects:
        - color: red
          shape: Fills in the area created by the "protrusion", making it less jagged.
        - color: azure
          shape: remainder of the shape, without the 'protrusion'.
general_rule: |
  Identify contiguous azure regions. Within each region, identify "indentations" or "protrusions".
  An indentation or protrusion can be defined based on a change in the width.
  Change the color of the azure pixels within these indentations/protrusions to red, starting from
  the point where the width changes, and filling inwards or outwards as appropriate to create a contiguous red section.
  The overall effect is to "smooth out" or "fill in" parts of the azure shape.

```

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify Azure Regions:** Find all contiguous regions of azure pixels in the input grid.
2.  **Identify Features:** For each azure region, scan each row and column to identify "indentations" or "protrusions". A feature is a contiguous set of azure pixels that are all adjacent.
3. **Determine Action**: Determine if the feature is an indentation or protrusion. An indentation will narrow as we go inward and a protrusion will widen as we go outwards.
4.  **Recolor:** Change the color of the azure pixels within the identified feature to red. The change starts from a point where the shape narrows and extends inward.

The revised natural language program is more general, moving away from a reliance on a neighboring color (white) and focusing instead on the shape characteristics (indentations/protrusions) of the azure regions themselves. This aligns better with the observed transformations across all three examples.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
