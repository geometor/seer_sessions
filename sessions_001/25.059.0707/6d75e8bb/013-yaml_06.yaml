- task: "Replace pixels within an azure region with red pixels."
  examples:
    - example_1:
      input_grid_shape: [5, 8]
      output_grid_shape: [5, 8]
      azure_region_shape: [3, 3]
      replaced_pixels: [[1,4]] #row, col
      notes: "A single red pixel replaces an azure pixel in a 3x3 azure region"
    - example_2:
      input_grid_shape: [ 5, 12 ]
      output_grid_shape: [ 5, 12 ]
      azure_region_shape: [ 3, 10 ]
      replaced_pixels: [[1,4], [1,8]]
      notes: "Two red pixels replace azure pixels in the second row of a 3x10 azure region, separated by 3 azure pixels"
    - example_3:
      input_grid_shape: [ 9, 18 ]
      output_grid_shape: [ 9, 18 ]
      azure_region_shape: [ 5, 6 ]
      replaced_pixels: [[2,9]]
      notes: "One red pixel replaces azure in a 5x6 block, in the second row, 4th column of the azure block"
    - example_4:
      input_grid_shape: [8, 8]
      output_grid_shape: [8, 8]
      azure_region_shape: [4, 4]
      replaced_pixels: [[3, 4], [3, 5]]
      notes: "Two red pixels replace azure pixels in the second row of a 4x4 azure region"
    - example_5:
      input_grid_shape: [ 4, 4 ]
      output_grid_shape: [ 4, 4 ]
      azure_region_shape: [ 4, 4 ]
      replaced_pixels: [[1, 1], [1, 2]]
      notes: "Two red pixels replace azure in a 4x4 block, in the second row"
