"""
1.  **Identify the Azure Object:** Find the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels in the input grid. This region can be of any shape.
2.  **Detect Enclosed Regions:** Within and around the bounding box of the azure object, search for regions of white (0) pixels that are *completely enclosed* by the azure object. A region is considered enclosed if, starting from any white pixel within it, you cannot reach the edge of the grid without crossing an azure pixel.
3.  **Fill Enclosed Regions:**  Change *all* pixels within any enclosed white region found in step 2 to red (2).
4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid, where all enclosed regions within the azure object are now filled with red.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code and natural language program were based on the first training example, which involved finding an azure object and filling enclosed white regions with red. The tests show that this approach doesn't generalize perfectly to all cases. Some examples work, while others produce incorrect outputs. The core issues seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Enclosure Detection:** The `is_enclosed` function sometimes misidentifies regions as enclosed or not enclosed, especially in cases with more complex azure shapes or when the white region touches the border of the azure shape but not the grid boundary.
2.  **Handling Multiple objects:**  The concept of "enclosed" seems related to a specific color surrounding another color, rather than a general "enclosed by any other color".
3. **Object interaction**: There is no interaction between objects other than the fill and the enclosing color.

The strategy to address these issues will involve:

1.  **Refining `is_enclosed`:** Improve the flood fill algorithm within `is_enclosed` or use a different approach like checking the boundary conditions.
2.  **Generalized Concept of Enclosure:**  Adjust the program logic to recognize enclosure by *any* color.
3.  **Iterative Improvement:** Test the revised code after each modification to pinpoint the effects of the changes.

**Example and Results Metrics**

Here's a breakdown of each example's results:

*   **Example 1:** Input shape (11, 11), Output shape (11, 11).  `transform` result: **Correct**. The azure object encloses a white region, which is correctly filled with red.
*   **Example 2:** Input shape (11, 20), Output shape (11, 20). `transform` result: **Correct**. Similar to Example 1, the azure encloses white and it is correctly filled.
*   **Example 3:** Input shape (15, 22), Output shape (15, 22).  `transform` result: **Incorrect**.  The input grid has two white areas enclosed by an azure object. One large one on the top left and a smaller one at the bottom right. The small white object is not enclosed by the azure object and incorrectly changed to red.
*    **Example 4:** Input shape(13,13), Output shape(13,13). `transform` result: **Correct** The input grid has two white squares, the smaller one enclosed by azure, the larger one enclosed by gray. Only the one enclosed by azure is colored red.
*   **Example 5:** Input shape(11,11), Output shape(11,11).  `transform` result: **Correct**. Similar to above, where the correct object is filled.

**Refined Natural Language Program**

1.  **Identify the Azure Object:** Locate the contiguous region of azure (8) pixels within the input grid. If no azure object is found, return the original grid unchanged.

2.  **Define Search Area:** Consider the bounding box of the azure object. Extend this bounding box by one pixel in all directions (up, down, left, and right) to create a "search area."

3.  **Iterate and Check for Enclosure:** Iterate through all pixels within the "search area". For each pixel:

    *   If the pixel is *not* azure, check if it is part of a region that is *completely enclosed* by azure pixels. A region is considered enclosed if, starting from any pixel within that region, you cannot reach the edge of the *entire grid* without crossing an azure pixel.
    *   If a pixel is part of an enclosed region, change all pixels in the enclosed region to red (2).

4.  **Output:** Return the modified grid, where all regions enclosed by azure within the search area are filled with red.

The critical change here is the clarified definition of "enclosed." It's not just about touching the azure object, but about being completely surrounded by it in a way that prevents reaching the *grid edge*. The "search area" concept helps limit the search to relevant pixels. We also generalized to allow different enclosed colors.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
