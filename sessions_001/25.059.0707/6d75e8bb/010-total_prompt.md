Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of pixels, initially containing two colors: white (0) and azure (8). The transformation changes some of the azure (8) pixels to red (2). The core shape defined by the azure pixels seems to remain constant, with specific interior azure pixels being replaced.

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D array
    properties:
      rows: 7
      columns: 8
      values: [0, 8, 2]
  - name: azure_region
    type: contiguous_block
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: irregular
  - name: red_region
      type: contiguous_block
      properties:
        color: red(2)
        shape: irregular

actions:
  - name: replace_color
    agent: unknown
    target: azure_region
    properties:
      source_color: 8
      target_color: 2
      location: inside the shape

relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: grid
    object: azure_region
  - type: spatial
    description: red pixels only occurs within a grid
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify the azure region:** Locate the contiguous block of azure (8) pixels within the input grid.
2.  **Determine replacement locations:** Inside the azure region, identify a set of azure pixels to be changed. The shape can be described as below.
    - Two separate single red pixels on row 3
    - Three connected red pixels on row 4 and row 5.
3.  **Replace pixels:** Change the color of the selected azure pixels to red (2). The overall outline formed by the original azure region remain unchanged.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
