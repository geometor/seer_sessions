objects:
  - type: pixel
    properties:
      value: int (0-9)
      color: str (white, blue, red, green, azure)
      position: (row, col)
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: (rows, cols)
      cells: list[pixel]

actions:
  - type: move
    description: Change the position of a pixel.
  - type: modify_value
    description: value can remain the same or be altered

relationships:
  - adjacency: Pixels can be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
  - grouping: Pixels of the same color can form contiguous groups (objects).

observations:
 - input grid dimensions: (14, 19)
 - output grid dimensions: (14, 19)
 - there are two distinct clusters of non-zero pixels in input
 - in the top cluster in the input, the azure pixels are in L-shape and a red pixel is inside the concave part of the L-shape.
 - in the bottom cluster in the input, a blue pixel is stacked on top of a green pixel, and repeated twice nearby. Also a red pixel appears separately.
 - the output contains modified positions of the identified elements
 - in the output, we see the L-shape pattern repeated multiple times
 - the two-pixel stack element is preserved, blue on top and green on the bottom, and repeats too
