"""
1.  **Identify Key Colors:** Focus on pixels with colors 1 (blue), 3 (green), 6 (magenta), and 8 (azure).
2.  **Blue (1) Replication:**
    *   If a single blue (1) pixel is present in row, create a mirror image of this single pixel in the same row.
    *   If two blue (1) pixels are present, check if they are mirrored, maintain mirrored pixels in the same row.
3.  **Green (3) Preservation:** Green (3) pixels remain unchanged in their original positions.
4.  **Magenta (6) and Azure (8) Transformation:**
    *   All Magenta (6) pixels become Azure (8).
    *   Azure (8) pixel creates a mirror of itself.
    *    If a row has transformed Azure pixels, copy them in the row of the original Azure pixels.

Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the `transform` function on the training examples and refine the natural language program accordingly.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial natural language program and the corresponding code have several issues, as evidenced by the mismatches in the training set results. The core problems seem to be:

1.  **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** The mirroring logic isn't consistently applied across all colors and scenarios. It appears to be attempting a global mirror based on the grid's center, rather than a mirror of object.
2.  **Misunderstanding of Azure Transformation:** The interaction between original Azure (8) pixels, transformed Magenta (6) pixels, and their mirrored counterparts is not handled correctly. The row copying logic is flawed.
3.  Not considering other colors that are not mentioned in the prompt, these colors should be ignored.

The strategy to resolve these errors involves:
*   Careful examination of *each* example, focusing on where the code's output deviates from the expected output.
*   Isolating the specific rule violations by identifying incorrect pixel placements.
*   Refining the natural language program step-by-step to capture the precise transformation rules.
*   Using python execution to confirm observations about the example data, rather than simple, sometimes misleading, visual comparisons

**Metrics and Observations (using code execution)**

To better understand, I will use python execution to confirm my undestanding.

**Example 1:**

*   **Input:** A 3, a 5, an 8, and a 6 are in the center column.
*   **Expected Output:** 3 and 5 are unchanged. 8 and 6 are transformed into two 8s, mirrored around the center column.
*   **Transformed Output:** Same as expected output.
* **Example 2:**
*   **Input:** 8 and 6 in the center column
*   **Expected Output:** 8 and 6 are transformed into two 8s, mirrored around the center column
*    **Transformed Output:** Same as expected output.
* **Example 3:**
*    **Input:** 3,8 and 6 in center column.
*    **Expected Output:** 8 and 6 are transformed into two 8s, mirrored around the center column.
*    **Transformed Output:** Same as expected output.
*   **Example 4:**
*   **Input:** 1, 8 and 6 are in the center column
*   **Expected Output:** 1,8 and 6 are transformed into two of their kind, mirrored.
*   **Transformed output:** Same as expected output.

*   **Example 5:**
*   **Input:** 1 and 8 next to each other, and 6 below 8. All of them are close to the center
*   **Expected Output:** 1,8 and 6 are transformed into two of their kinds, mirrored.
* **Transformed Output**:

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Preservation:** Pixels with colors 3 (green) and 5 (gray) remain in their original positions and are not modified.
2.  **Color 8 (Azure) Mirroring:**  Pixels with color 8 (azure) create a mirrored copy of themselves on the opposite side of the grid's central column.
3.  **Color 6 (Magenta) Transformation and Mirroring:** Pixels with color 6 (magenta) first change their color to 8 (azure), and *then* create a mirrored copy of themselves (now as color 8) on the opposite side of the grid's central column.
4.  **Color 1 (Blue) Mirroring:** Pixels with color 1 (blue) create a mirrored copy of themselves on the opposite side of the grid's central column.
5.  **Mirror Axis:** The mirroring of pixels for colors 1, 6 and 8 occurs across the vertical axis defined by the center column of the input grid. The center column is determined by (number of columns - 1)/2


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid
