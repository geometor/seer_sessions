Copy them directly from the input to the output.\n3.  **Magenta Transformation:** All pixels that were color 6 (magenta) in the input grid become color 8 (azure) in the output grid. *Do not mirror them yet*.\n4.  **Blue Mirroring:** For each pixel of color 1 (blue) in the input grid, create a mirrored copy with color 1 (blue) on the opposite side of the grid's vertical center. The vertical center is determined by `(number of columns - 1) / 2`.\n5.  **Azure Mirroring:** For each pixel of color 8 (azure) in the *input* grid AND for each pixel that *became* color 8 (from the original color 6), create a mirrored copy with color 8 (azure) on the opposite side of the grid's vertical center.\n6. **Output Construction:** The output grid is built by combining these actions: preserving static pixels, transforming magenta pixels, and mirroring blue and azure pixels. The order of operations for mirroring is important. Process the *original* color 8s and color 1s, then any newly created 8s.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_pixels(grid, color):\n    \"\"\"Finds the coordinates of all pixels of a given color in the input grid.\"\"\"\n    return np.argwhere(grid == color)\n\ndef mirror_pixel(input_grid, coord):\n    \"\"\"Mirrors a single pixel across the vertical center of the *input* grid.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n    x, y = coord\n    mirror_y = cols - 1 - y\n    return (x, mirror_y)\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid according to the observed rules.\"\"\"\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    rows, cols = input_grid.shape\n\n    # Static Pixels (3 - green, 5 - gray):  These remain unchanged.\n    # (Implicitly handled by initializing output_grid as a copy)\n\n    # Magenta Transformation (6 -> 8):\n    magenta_pixels = find_pixels(input_grid, 6)\n    for x, y in magenta_pixels:\n        output_grid[x, y] = 8  # Change magenta to azure\n\n    # Blue Mirroring (1):\n    blue_pixels = find_pixels(input_grid, 1)\n    for x, y in blue_pixels:\n        mirrored_coord = mirror_pixel(input_grid, (x, y))\n        output_grid[mirrored_coord] = 1\n\n    # Azure Mirroring (8): Original and Transformed\n    # Need to re-find the 8's since they might not be in the same place\n    azure_pixels = find_pixels(output_grid, 8)\n    for x, y in azure_pixels:\n        mirrored_coord = mirror_pixel(input_grid, (x,y))\n        output_grid[mirrored_coord] = 8\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
