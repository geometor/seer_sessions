The colors are represented by single-digit integers (0-9). The input and output grids have the same dimensions. There appear to be specific color patterns and arrangements that are being modified. The most notable changes seem to involve the repetition and shifting of certain colored objects, specifically those involving colors 1, 3, 6, and 8. There also appears to be some kind of mirroring or reflection involved.\n\n**YAML Block - Facts:**\n\n"
