The primary colors present are yellow (4), azure (8), and white (0). There are distinct groups of connected pixels of the same color, forming \"objects\". The transformation seems to involve some form of replication or mirroring of these objects, specifically the yellow and azure ones, across both the horizontal and vertical axes. The white pixels act as background.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

There are two distinct \"lines\" (horizontal contiguous blocks) of yellow, and two isolated azure pixels.\n\n2.  **Horizontal and Vertical Replication:** Replicate non-white pixel groups. The existing objects appear replicated on the other half of the horizontal and vertical axis. If an object exists on the left half it gets replicated at an equivalent position in the right half. If an object exists in the top half it gets replicated in a similar location at the bottom half.\n\nIn simpler, more step by step form:\n\n1. Scan first half of rows (0 to 6, since height = 13), from left to right and top to bottom.\n2. When a non-white pixel is located, check for adjacent pixels in horizontal directions, forming horizontal lines. Record the color, and x-y locations.\n3. After checking the first half, scan the bottom half (7-13).\n4.  For each detected object, check the corresponding x-y coordinates in the other halves of both axis.\n5. Copy each found object in the original coordinates to the output grid.\n6. Copy each object to it's mirror position on the other horizontal half, and other vertical half.\n\n"
