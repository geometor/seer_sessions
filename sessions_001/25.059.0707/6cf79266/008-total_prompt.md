Train Set Results:
Okay, let's analyze the results of running the provided code against the training examples and formulate a revised natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was based on the first training example and makes a specific assumption: a 3x3 uniform square is replaced based on its *starting row* (5->red, 6->yellow, 7->azure). The other examples show this is not the complete rule. We need to generalize the rule to account for different square colors and positions, and also make sure the output grid is a different shape than the input.

My strategy is to:

1.  **Analyze Each Example:** Carefully examine the input and output grids of each example.
2.  **Identify Objects:** Determine the key objects (3x3 squares, colors) and note positions
3.  **Refine the Rule:** Formulate a more general rule that explains *all* training examples, not just the first.
4. **Ensure we handle the shape change**

**Example Analysis and Metrics**

I'll use `code_execution` to programmatically extract information from each example to aid in pattern detection. Here is the python code that helps show how to do that:

```python
import numpy as np

def analyze_example(input_grid, output_grid):
    input_grid = np.array(input_grid)
    output_grid = np.array(output_grid)

    input_3x3_info = find_3x3_square(input_grid)
    output_3x3_info = find_3x3_square(output_grid)

    print(f"  Input 3x3 Square:")
    if input_3x3_info[0] is not None:
        print(f"    Found at: ({input_3x3_info[0]}, {input_3x3_info[1]})")
        print(f"    Color: {input_3x3_info[2]}")
    else:
        print("    Not found")

    print(f"  Output 3x3 Square:")
    if output_3x3_info[0] is not None:
        print(f"    Found at: ({output_3x3_info[0]}, {output_3x3_info[1]})")
        print(f"    Color: {output_3x3_info[2]}")
    else:
        print("    Not found")

    print(f" input shape: {input_grid.shape}")
    print(f" output shape: {output_grid.shape}")

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Find a 3x3 Square:** Locate a 3x3 square within the input grid where all pixels have the same color. Note the color and top-left position of this square.
2. **Determine the replacement color and output shape**: If the color of the 3x3 square in the input grid is gray, the output grid will have the dimensions 3x12 and contain a 3x3 red square at (0,9), otherwise, the output grid will contain a 3x3 azure square. If the color of the input square is white, the output dimensions are 3x21 with the new azure square at (0, 18). If the input color is orange, the output dimensions are 3x15 with the azure square at (0,12).
3.  **Create Output:** Create the output grid. The output grid shape is always 3 rows, and the number of columns changes depending on the color of the input 3x3 square.
4.  **Replace with New Square:** Create the 3x3 square of the replacement color and place it in the output grid at the correct location.


**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
