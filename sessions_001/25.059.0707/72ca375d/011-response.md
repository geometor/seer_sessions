Okay, let's analyze the results of running the initial code against the training examples and develop a refined natural language program.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial code was designed to extract a 2x2 yellow square. This worked for the first training example, but the other examples reveal a more general pattern. It seems the task isn't *always* about extracting a 2x2 yellow square. Instead, a yellow object of some kind is being extracted, and the shape and size of the yellow object varies. The existing code *sometimes* works, because some examples *do* include 2x2 yellow squares. My strategy is to:

1.  Analyze each example input and output carefully, paying attention to the yellow objects.
2.  Modify the `find_shape` function to be more flexible, not restricting its search only to the 2x2 shape of yellow color.
3.  Use the flexible shape finding to construct a new, generalized natural language program, and regenerate code.

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

I'll use a loop to systematically analyze each example. I will use `code_execution` with calls to the existing `transform` function, so you can inspect how i'm interacting with the existing code.
