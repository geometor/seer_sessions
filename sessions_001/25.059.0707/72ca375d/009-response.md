Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves a grid of colored pixels. The input grid contains several distinct colored regions (yellow, azure, and red), while the output grid contains only a small yellow square. The other colors and most of the background (white, represented by 0) are gone. It seems like the transformation focuses on extracting a specific shape of a specific color.

**YAML Block (Facts):**



```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      rows: 10
      columns: 10
      colors: [0, 2, 4, 8]  # white, red, yellow, azure
  - type: shape
    properties:
      color: 4  # yellow
      type: rectangle # implicit
      initial_position: (1,2) # row, col of top left pixel
      initial_dimensions: (2x2)
  - type: shape
      color: 8
      type: irregular
      initial_position: (2, 6)
      initial_dimensions: Not regular
  - type: shape
      color: 2 #red
      type: rectangle
      initial_position: (7,2)
      initial_dimensions: (2x4)

actions:
  - type: extraction
    target: yellow rectangle
    parameters:
      position: top-left
      dimensions: 2x2

relationships:
 - input contains multiple shapes
 - output contains one shape
 - output shape exists in the input

```



**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the 2x2 yellow (color value 4) square in the input grid.
2.  **Extract** this 2x2 yellow square.
3.  The **output** is the extracted 2x2 yellow square. All other objects and colors are discarded.
