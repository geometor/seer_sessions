Okay, here's my analysis of the provided input-output example:

**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a larger grid (input) into a smaller grid (output). The input grid contains various colored objects (represented by numbers 0-9), while the output grid seems to focus on a specific color, and its spatial arrangement is simplified. The key colors observed in the input are green (3), grey (5), and azure (8), with white (0) as the background. The output only shows grey (5) and white(0).

**YAML Block (Facts):**


```yaml
objects:
  - type: grid
    properties:
      dimensions: [10x10] (input), [2x4] (output)
      elements: integers (0-9) representing colors
  - type: object_cluster
    properties:
      color: green (3)
      shape: irregular
      location: top-left
  - type: object_cluster
    properties:
      color: grey (5)
      shape: irregular, L-shaped
      location: top-right
  - type: object_cluster
    properties:
      color: azure (8)
      shape: irregular
      location: bottom-left, bottom-center
  - type: output_object
    properties:
      color: gray (5)
      shape: rectangle

actions:
  - type: select
    description: Select the grey (5) colored object cluster.
  - type: simplify
    description: Reduce the selected object to a rectangular representation, removing its original shape details.
  - type: extract
    description: Isolate and extract the simplified object, discarding all other parts of the input.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Identify** the gray (5) colored object cluster within the input grid.
2.  **Ignore** other objects, and background.
3.  **Enclose** a rectangular region around gray object in output.
4. **Output** a simplified gray object as 2 x 4 grid.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

- generate a Python module to represent the natural language program 
- follow the template below
- all common math and science libraries are available
- create docstring only at top - but comment the workflow in the function
- use helper functions for common operations like finding objects, counting,
  measuring, moving, etc. 

remember - we are working iteratively - so this code will inform your future
self as we converge on the solution

*template:*

```python
"""
{{ natural language description of the transformation rule }}
"""

{{ imports }}

def transform(input_grid):
    # initialize output_grid

    # change output pixels 

    return output_grid

```
