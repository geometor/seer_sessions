The output grid is a smaller, condensed representation of the input, focusing on the bounding boxes of these objects and their relative positions. The transformation seems to involve a combination of object detection, bounding box creation, and a \"zooming in\" or cropping operation to focus on the areas of interest. It appears two colored objects from the input will be inside a bounding box. The border of the output bounding box appears to use red (color code 2).\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

Fill this rectangle with red color (2).\n4.  **Transfer Inner Objects:** For the detected objects inside the bounding box in the input, copy their pixels to the corresponding positions within the output grid, inside the bounding box.
