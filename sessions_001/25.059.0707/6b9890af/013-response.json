The output is a smaller grid that seems to combine elements of both the red and blue objects. The output grid's size is determined by the blue object and its positioning seems to be relative to the overlapping shape from red and blue.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

The width/height of this square determines the output grid size\n\n3.  **Determine the overlapping region:** Find how the blue square overlap with the red square.\n\n4.  **Construct the output grid**\n    - The overlapping grid with red (2) and blue(1) pixel becomes the center part of the output\n    - Add a border around the selected overlapping blue and red pixels with red (2) color, making the final output have dimensions of the blue object\n\n5.  **Populate Output Grid**:\n    - Fill cells with 2 if no blue pixels.\n    - Where blue exists, fill 1, replacing any 2.\n\nIn essence, the transformation extracts a region around the area where the blue object overlaps or is in proximity, with the original colors. And forms a frame of the dimension of blue square filled with 2.\n"
