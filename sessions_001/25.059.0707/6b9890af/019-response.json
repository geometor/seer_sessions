One object, made of red (value 2) pixels, forms a hollow rectangular shape. The second object, made of yellow (value 4) pixels, forms a smaller, irregular shape located towards the bottom-right of the red rectangle. The output grid is significantly smaller than the input. The output grid seems to maintain only the general location information for relative position of two objects. It contains a frame/border of '2' (red color) in which the yellow object (4) is embedded. There are 0s representing empty background.\n\n**YAML Block (Facts):**\n\n"

In the provided example we have two objects to pay attention to - red(2) and yellow(4).\n2.  **Bounding Box Creation**: Create a bounding box (minimum size rectangle) around the yellow shape. Extend the bounding box by adding a layer of 0 at the bottom and top and two columns of 0 on the left and right sides.\n3.  **Red Border**:  Add a one-pixel-wide border of red (2) color around outside the current grid.\n4.  **Output**: The transformed grid represents the relative position of the objects.\n"
