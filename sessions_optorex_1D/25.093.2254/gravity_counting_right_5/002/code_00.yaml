Data:
  - Type: Sequence/Array
    Structure: NumPy array (or equivalent list) of integers
    Length: 12
    Range: 0-9
    Role: Input
  - Type: Sequence/Array
    Structure: NumPy array (or equivalent list) of binary integers (0 or 1)
    Length: 12
    Role: Output
    Pattern: Contiguous block of 1s followed by contiguous block of 0s

Transformation:
  - Action: Count
    Object: Non-zero integers in the input sequence/array
    Result: Count 'N'
  - Action: Generate Output Sequence/Array
    Constraint_1: Length must be 12
    Constraint_2: First 'N' elements are 1
    Constraint_3: Remaining '12 - N' elements are 0
