            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input Data:** The input is consistently a sequence of 12 single-digit integers (ranging from 0 to 9).\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a sequence of 12 integers, but these are exclusively 0s and 1s.\n3.  **Structure:** The output sequence always starts with a contiguous block of 1s, followed by a contiguous block of 0s. The length of the block of 1s varies between examples.\n4.  **Transformation Clue:** The number of 1s in the output seems to be related to the content of the input sequence. Specifically, comparing the number of 1s in the output to the properties of the input suggests a counting mechanism.\n5.  **Hypothesis:** I observed that the number of 1s in the output sequence exactly matches the count of non-zero numbers in the corresponding input sequence.\n    *   train_1: Input has 7 non-zeros (`6, 4, 1, 7, 3, 3, 7`). Output has 7 ones.\n    *   train_2: Input has 5 non-zeros (`5, 3, 8, 3, 2`). Output has 5 ones.\n    *   train_3: Input has 5 non-zeros (`6, 2, 1, 4, 1`). Output has 5 ones.\n    *   train_4: Input has 5 non-zeros (`1, 6, 4, 7, 1`). Output has 5 ones.\n    *   train_5: Input has 6 non-zeros (`3, 6, 1, 3, 5, 8`). Output has 6 ones.\n    *   train_6: Input has 10 non-zeros (`8, 8, 1, 7, 6, 1, 4, 2, 9, 4`). Output has 10 ones.\n    *   train_7: Input has 8 non-zeros (`3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 2, 8, 5`). Output has 8 ones.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The rule appears to be: count the non-zero elements in the input sequence. Let this count be `N`. The output sequence consists of `N` ones followed by `12 - N` zeros.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
