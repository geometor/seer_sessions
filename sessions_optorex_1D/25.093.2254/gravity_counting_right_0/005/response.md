"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers based on the count of its non-zero elements.
The rule is:
1. Count the number of non-zero elements in the input sequence (N).
2. Determine the total length of the input sequence (L).
3. Construct an output sequence containing N ones followed by (L - N) zeros.
4. Return the resulting sequence as a NumPy array.
