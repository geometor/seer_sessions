## Perception of Task Elements

1.  **Input Data:** The input consists of a sequence of integers, separated by spaces. In all provided examples, the sequence has a fixed length of 12 elements. The elements themselves are single digits ranging from 0 to 9.
2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a sequence of integers, separated by spaces, and has the same length (12) as the input sequence. The output sequence consists only of 0s and 1s.
3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve counting certain elements in the input and using that count to construct the output sequence. Specifically, the number of non-zero elements in the input determines the number of `1`s at the beginning of the output sequence. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with `0`s. The original values and positions of the non-zero elements in the input do not seem to influence the output, only their count does.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The error message "negative dimensions are not allowed" consistently occurred across all training and test examples when executing the previous code. This error typically arises in NumPy when attempting to create an array with a negative size (e.g., `np.ones(-2)`). Given that the core logic involves creating arrays of ones and zeros based on counts derived from the input, the error indicates that either the count of non-zero elements (`N`) or the calculated count of zero elements (`L - N`) resulted in a negative number.

The code execution simulation revealed that the likely cause was the `transform` function incorrectly assuming its `input_sequence` argument was already a numerical list or array. When passed the raw input string (e.g., `"1 0 0 0 7 0 5 0 0 9 0 7"`), `np.array()` creates an array containing that single string, leading to incorrect length calculation (`L`) and non-zero count (`N`), which in turn could lead to a negative value for `L - N` when calculating the number of zeros.

The strategy is to explicitly parse the input string within the `transform` function *before* performing any numerical analysis or array creation. The input string needs to be split into individual number strings, converted to integers, and then processed.
