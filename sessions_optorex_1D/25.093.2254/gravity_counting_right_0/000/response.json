In all provided examples, the sequence has a fixed length of 12 elements. The elements themselves are single digits ranging from 0 to 9.\n2.  **Output Data:** The output is also a sequence of integers, separated by spaces, and has the same length (12) as the input sequence. The output sequence consists only of 0s and 1s.\n3.  **Transformation:** The transformation appears to involve counting certain elements in the input and using that count to construct the output sequence. Specifically, the number of non-zero elements in the input determines the number of `1`s at the beginning of the output sequence. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with `0`s. The original values and positions of the non-zero elements in the input do not seem to influence the output, only their count does.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
