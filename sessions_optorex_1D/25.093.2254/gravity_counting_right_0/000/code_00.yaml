task_type: sequence_transformation
input_data:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  separator: space
  length: fixed (12 in examples)
  element_range: 0-9
output_data:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  separator: space
  length: same as input (12 in examples)
  element_range: 0-1
transformation:
  - action: count
    target: non-zero elements in the input sequence
    result: a number (let's call it N)
  - action: construct_output
    details:
      - Create a sequence of N ones.
      - Create a sequence of (L - N) zeros, where L is the length of the input sequence.
      - Concatenate the sequence of ones and the sequence of zeros.
    output_structure: N ones followed by (L - N) zeros.
relationship:
  - The number of '1's in the output sequence is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input sequence.
  - The number of '0's in the output sequence is equal to the count of zero elements in the input sequence.
  - The total length of the output sequence is equal to the total length of the input sequence.
