objects:
  - input_sequence:
      description: A sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers from 0 to 9.
  - output_sequence:
      description: A sequence (list or array) of 12 binary integers (0 or 1).
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers 0 or 1.
        - structure: Consists of a contiguous block of 1s followed by a contiguous block of 0s.
relationships:
  - rule: The number of 1s at the beginning of the output_sequence is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input_sequence.
actions:
  - count: Determine the number of elements in the input_sequence that are not equal to 0.
  - construct: Build the output_sequence by creating a list containing the calculated count of 1s, followed by 0s to fill the remaining positions up to a total length of 12.
