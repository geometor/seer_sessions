**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples. This indicates the `transform` function is receiving input as a NumPy array (or similar list-like structure) rather than the expected space-separated string. The previous code attempt incorrectly assumed string input and tried to parse it using `.split()`.

The strategy is to modify the transformation logic to directly accept a list or array of integers as input, eliminating the string parsing step (`parse_input`). The core logic of counting non-zero elements and constructing the output based on that count appears consistent with all provided examples and should be retained. The output formatting function (`format_output`) also needs adjustment if the final output is expected as a list/array of integers rather than a space-separated string. Based on the output format in the examples, it seems the desired output format is *also* a list/array of integers, not a string.

**Metrics**

| Example | Input Sequence (List)                 | Non-Zero Count | Expected Output (List)                | Match (Non-Zero Count == # of 1s) |

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_sequence:
      description: A sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers from 0 to 9.
  - output_sequence:
      description: A sequence (list or array) of 12 binary integers (0 or 1).
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers 0 or 1.
        - structure: Consists of a contiguous block of 1s followed by a contiguous block of 0s.
relationships:
  - rule: The number of 1s at the beginning of the output_sequence is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input_sequence.
actions:
  - count: Determine the number of elements in the input_sequence that are not equal to 0.
  - construct: Build the output_sequence by creating a list containing the calculated count of 1s, followed by 0s to fill the remaining positions up to a total length of 12.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence (a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Count how many integers in the input sequence are non-zero (greater than 0). Let this count be `N`.
3.  Construct the output sequence (as a list or array):
    *   Create a list containing `N` integers with the value `1`.
    *   Append `12 - N` integers with the value `0` to this list.
4.  Return the constructed output sequence.
