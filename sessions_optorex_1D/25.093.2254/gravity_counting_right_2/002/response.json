            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples. This indicates the `transform` function is receiving input as a NumPy array (or similar list-like structure) rather than the expected space-separated string. The previous code attempt incorrectly assumed string input and tried to parse it using `.split()`.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the transformation logic to directly accept a list or array of integers as input, eliminating the string parsing step (`parse_input`). The core logic of counting non-zero elements and constructing the output based on that count appears consistent with all provided examples and should be retained. The output formatting function (`format_output`) also needs adjustment if the final output is expected as a list/array of integers rather than a space-separated string. Based on the output format in the examples, it seems the desired output format is *also* a list/array of integers, not a string.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n| Example | Input Sequence (List)                 | Non-Zero Count | Expected Output (List)                | Match (Non-Zero Count == # of 1s) |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------ | :------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0, 6, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 9]` | 5              | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Yes                               |\n| train_2 | `[7, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 3, 7, 0]` | 6              | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Yes                               |\n| train_3 | `[0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 6, 0, 3, 1, 8, 0]` | 6              | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Yes                               |\n| train_4 | `[9, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 1]` | 6              | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Yes                               |\n| train_5 | `[3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 9, 0, 0, 6, 8, 7, 9]` | 9              | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]` | Yes                               |\n| train_6 | `[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 8, 8, 0]` | 5              | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Yes                               |\n| train_7 | `[0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]` | 5              | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Yes                               |\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
