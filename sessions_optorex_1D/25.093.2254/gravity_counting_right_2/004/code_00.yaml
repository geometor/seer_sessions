objects:
  - input_sequence:
      description: A sequence of 12 numerical digits (0-9). The execution environment might provide this as a list, NumPy array, or similar structure containing these 12 digits.
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers from 0 to 9.
  - output_sequence:
      description: A sequence of 12 binary digits (0 or 1).
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers 0 or 1.
        - structure: Consists of a contiguous block of '1's at the beginning, followed by a contiguous block of '0's.
relationships:
  - rule: The count of '1's at the beginning of the output_sequence is exactly equal to the total count of non-zero elements within the input_sequence.
actions:
  - access: Retrieve the 12 individual numerical digits from the input_sequence, regardless of its specific data structure (e.g., flatten if necessary).
  - count: Determine the number of digits accessed from the input_sequence that are not equal to 0. Let this count be `N`.
  - construct: Build the output_sequence by:
      1. Creating a sequence of `N` digits, all equal to '1'.
      2. Creating a sequence of `12 - N` digits, all equal to '0'.
      3. Concatenating the sequence of '1's followed by the sequence of '0's.
