The output is also a sequence of 12 digits, consisting only of '1's and '0's, separated by spaces. The core transformation appears to involve counting certain elements in the input sequence and representing that count in the output structure. Specifically, the number of non-zero digits in the input sequence directly determines the number of '1's at the beginning of the output sequence. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with '0's to maintain the total length of 12.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
