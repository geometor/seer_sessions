objects:
  - input_sequence:
      description: A sequence of 12 single digits (0-9) separated by spaces.
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers from 0 to 9.
  - output_sequence:
      description: A sequence of 12 binary digits (0 or 1) separated by spaces.
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers 0 or 1.
        - structure: Consists of a contiguous block of '1's followed by a contiguous block of '0's.
relationships:
  - rule: The number of '1's in the output_sequence is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input_sequence.
actions:
  - count: Determine the number of elements in the input_sequence that are not equal to 0.
  - construct: Build the output_sequence by placing the calculated count of '1's at the beginning, followed by '0's to fill the remaining positions up to a total length of 12.
