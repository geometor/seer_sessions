**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input consists of a sequence of 12 single digits separated by spaces. The output is also a sequence of 12 digits, consisting only of '1's and '0's, separated by spaces. The core transformation appears to involve counting certain elements in the input sequence and representing that count in the output structure. Specifically, the number of non-zero digits in the input sequence directly determines the number of '1's at the beginning of the output sequence. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with '0's to maintain the total length of 12.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_sequence:
      description: A sequence of 12 single digits (0-9) separated by spaces.
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers from 0 to 9.
  - output_sequence:
      description: A sequence of 12 binary digits (0 or 1) separated by spaces.
      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers 0 or 1.
        - structure: Consists of a contiguous block of '1's followed by a contiguous block of '0's.
relationships:
  - rule: The number of '1's in the output_sequence is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input_sequence.
actions:
  - count: Determine the number of elements in the input_sequence that are not equal to 0.
  - construct: Build the output_sequence by placing the calculated count of '1's at the beginning, followed by '0's to fill the remaining positions up to a total length of 12.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Count how many digits in the input sequence are non-zero (greater than 0). Let this count be `N`.
3.  Construct the output sequence:
    *   Start with `N` digits of '1'.
    *   Append `12 - N` digits of '0'.
4.  Format the output sequence with spaces between the digits.
