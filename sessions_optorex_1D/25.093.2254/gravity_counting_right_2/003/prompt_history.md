**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input consists of a sequence of 12 single digits separated by spaces. The output is also a sequence of 12 digits, consisting only of '1's and '0's, separated by spaces. The core transformation appears to involve counting certain elements in the input sequence and representing that count in the output structure. Specifically, the number of non-zero digits in the input sequence directly determines the number of '1's at the beginning of the output sequence. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with '0's to maintain the total length of 12.

**Facts:**

      properties:
        - length: 12
        - elements: Integers 0 or 1.
        - structure: Consists of a contiguous block of '1's followed by a contiguous block of '0's.
relationships:
  - rule: The number of '1's in the output_sequence is equal to the count of non-zero elements in the input_sequence.
actions:
  - count: Determine the number of elements in the input_sequence that are not equal to 0.
  - construct: Build the output_sequence by placing the calculated count of '1's at the beginning, followed by '0's to fill the remaining positions up to a total length of 12.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Count how many digits in the input sequence are non-zero (greater than 0). Let this count be `N`.
3.  Construct the output sequence:
    *   Start with `N` digits of '1'.
    *   Append `12 - N` digits of '0'.
4.  Format the output sequence with spaces between the digits.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples. This indicates the `transform` function is receiving input as a NumPy array (or similar list-like structure) rather than the expected space-separated string. The previous code attempt incorrectly assumed string input and tried to parse it using `.split()`.

The strategy is to modify the transformation logic to directly accept a list or array of integers as input, eliminating the string parsing step (`parse_input`). The core logic of counting non-zero elements and constructing the output based on that count appears consistent with all provided examples and should be retained. The output formatting function (`format_output`) also needs adjustment if the final output is expected as a list/array of integers rather than a space-separated string. Based on the output format in the examples, it seems the desired output format is *also* a list/array of integers, not a string.
