task_elements:
  - name: Input Grid
    type: numpy.ndarray
    shape: (1, 12) # Updated shape based on error messages
    element_type: int
    element_range: 0-9
    properties: A 2D grid containing a single row of 12 digits.
  - name: Output Grid
    type: numpy.ndarray
    shape: (1, 12) # Assuming output shape should match input shape
    element_type: int
    element_range: 0-1
    properties: A 2D grid containing a single row of 12 binary digits (0 or 1).
relationships:
  - type: Transformation
    from: Input Grid
    to: Output Grid
    action:
      - Access the first (and only) row of the Input Grid, which is a sequence of 12 digits.
      - Count the number of non-zero elements in this sequence. Let this count be N.
      - Create the Output Grid, initially filled with zeros, having the same shape as the Input Grid (1, 12).
      - Set the first N elements of the single row in the Output Grid to 1.
      - The remaining (12 - N) elements in the row remain 0.
