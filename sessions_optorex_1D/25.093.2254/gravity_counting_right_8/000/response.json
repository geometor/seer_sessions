The output is also a sequence of 12 digits, but these are restricted to only 0s and 1s. The transformation appears to relate the count of certain elements in the input sequence to the structure of the output sequence. Specifically, the number of non-zero digits in the input sequence seems to determine the number of '1's that appear at the beginning of the output sequence. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with '0's.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
