Input:
  type: sequence # Assumed to be list or numpy array based on error
  elements: integers (0-9)
  length: 12
Output:
  type: sequence # List or numpy array expected by the environment
  elements: binary integers (0 or 1)
  length: 12
Transformation:
  - Action: Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
  - Action: Count the number of elements in the input sequence that are not equal to 0.
  - Result: Determine a count 'N'.
  - Action: Generate an output sequence of length 12.
  - Rule: The first 'N' elements of the output sequence are assigned the integer value 1.
  - Rule: The subsequent (12 - N) elements of the output sequence are assigned the integer value 0.
Relationship:
  - The count of non-zero input elements directly determines the count of leading 1s in the output sequence.
  - The specific non-zero values and their original positions in the input are irrelevant to the output structure, only their quantity matters.
