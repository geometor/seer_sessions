**Perception of the Elements:**

The task takes a sequence of 12 single digits as input and produces a sequence of 12 binary digits (0 or 1) as output. The key transformation appears to be related to the presence of non-zero digits in the input sequence. Specifically, the number of non-zero digits in the input dictates the number of '1's that appear at the beginning of the output sequence. The remaining positions in the output are filled with '0's. The original positions or values (other than being zero or non-zero) of the input digits do not seem to influence the output directly, only their count.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: digits (0-9)
  length: 12
  separator: space
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: binary digits (0 or 1)
  length: 12
  separator: space
Transformation:
  - Action: Count the number of non-zero digits in the input sequence.
  - Result: Determine a count 'N'.
  - Action: Generate an output sequence of length 12.
  - Rule: The first 'N' elements of the output sequence are '1'.
  - Rule: The subsequent (12 - N) elements of the output sequence are '0'.
Relationship:
  - The count of non-zero input digits directly determines the count of leading '1's in the output sequence.
  - The order or specific values (beyond zero/non-zero) of input digits are irrelevant to the output structure.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Count how many digits in the input sequence are not equal to 0. Let this count be `N`.
3.  Create a new sequence of 12 elements.
4.  Set the first `N` elements of the new sequence to 1.
5.  Set the remaining `12 - N` elements of the new sequence to 0.
6.  Output the new sequence, with elements separated by spaces.
