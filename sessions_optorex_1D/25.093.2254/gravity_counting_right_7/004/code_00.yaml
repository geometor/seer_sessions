Input:
  type: numpy array
  subtype: integer grid (implicitly flattened for processing)
  elements: integers (0-9)
  size: 12 elements (shape might vary, e.g., 1x12, 2x6, 3x4, etc., but total count is 12)
Output:
  type: numpy array
  subtype: integer sequence
  elements: binary integers (0 or 1)
  size: 12 elements (always a 1D sequence of length 12)
Transformation:
  - Action: Receive the input numpy array.
  - Action: Flatten the input array into a 1D sequence.
  - Action: Count the number of elements in the flattened sequence that are not equal to 0. Let this count be 'N'.
  - Action: Create a 1D numpy array of size 12, initialized with zeros.
  - Action: Set the first 'N' elements of this output array to 1.
  - Result: The output array contains 'N' ones followed by (12 - N) zeros.
Relationship:
  - The total count of non-zero elements in the input (regardless of their position or original grid structure) determines the number of leading '1's in the 1D output array.
  - The dimensions or specific arrangement of the input grid are irrelevant after flattening.
