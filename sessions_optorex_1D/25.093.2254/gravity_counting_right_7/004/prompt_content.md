"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers based on the count of non-zero elements.
It counts the number of non-zero integers in the input sequence. Let this count be 'N'.
It then creates an output sequence of length 12, where the first 'N' elements are 1 
and the remaining (12 - N) elements are 0.
