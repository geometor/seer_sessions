*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is a sequence of space-separated integers.
    *   The output is also a sequence of space-separated integers, specifically consisting only of 0s and 1s.
    *   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
    *   The output sequence always starts with a block of 1s, followed by a block of 0s (or potentially only 1s or only 0s, though not seen in examples).
    *   The key transformation seems related to the count of non-zero elements in the input.

    1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
    2.  Count how many numbers in the input sequence are not zero. Let this count be `N`.
    3.  Determine the total length of the input sequence. Let this length be `L`.
    4.  Generate an output sequence consisting of `N` ones followed by `L - N` zeros.
    5.  Format the generated sequence as a space-separated string for the final output.
