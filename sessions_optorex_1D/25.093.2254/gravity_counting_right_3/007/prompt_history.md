*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input is a sequence of space-separated integers.
    *   The output is also a sequence of space-separated integers, specifically consisting only of 0s and 1s.
    *   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
    *   The output sequence always starts with a block of 1s, followed by a block of 0s (or potentially only 1s or only 0s, though not seen in examples).
    *   The key transformation seems related to the count of non-zero elements in the input.

*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The provided code failed across all examples with the same error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error strongly indicates that the `count_non_zeros` helper function, specifically the `if element != 0:` line, was attempting to evaluate the truthiness of a NumPy array instead of a single number.
    *   This likely occurred because the execution environment passed the input data to the `transform` function as a NumPy array (potentially a 2D array with one row, e.g., `np.array([[6, 6, 0, ...]])`), while the `count_non_zeros` function iterated through it in a way that yielded array elements (`element`) rather than scalar integers.
    *   The core logic observed initially (count non-zeros, generate 1s, pad with 0s) appears correct based on the input/output pairs. The failure is in the implementation's handling of the data type provided by the execution environment.
    *   **Strategy:** Modify the implementation to correctly handle NumPy array inputs. The most robust way to count non-zero elements in a NumPy array is to use `np.count_nonzero(array)` or `np.sum(array != 0)`. The natural language program and documentation should be updated to reflect this NumPy-specific approach, assuming the input format is a NumPy array.

*   **Metrics and Verification:**
    *   The `tool_code` execution confirms the expected non-zero counts for each example and reproduces the ambiguity error when the input is treated as a 2D NumPy array (shape `(1, N)`), supporting the hypothesis about the input format or the iteration logic error.

    5.  Generate an output list consisting of `N` ones followed by `Z` zeros.
    6.  Return the generated list of integers.
