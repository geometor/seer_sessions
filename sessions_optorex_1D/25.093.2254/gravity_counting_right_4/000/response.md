*   **Perception:** The task takes a sequence of 12 single-digit integers as input and produces a sequence of 12 binary digits (0s and 1s) as output. The output sequence always starts with a block of '1's followed by a block of '0's. The length of the block of '1's varies between examples. By comparing the input and output sequences across the examples, it appears that the number of '1's in the output corresponds directly to the count of non-zero numbers in the input sequence.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_transformation
    input:
      data_type: list_of_integers
      length: 12
      range: 0-9
      delimiter: space
    output:
      data_type: list_of_integers
      length: 12
      range: 0-1
      delimiter: space
      pattern: sequence_of_ones_followed_by_zeros
    transformation:
      relationship: input_non_zero_count_determines_output_ones_count
      rule: The number of '1's in the output sequence is equal to the count of non-zero integers in the input sequence. The remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with '0's.
    examples:
      - id: train_1
        input: "4 0 0 3 3 2 9 7 7 0 0 0"
        non_zero_count: 7
        output: "1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0"
      - id: train_2
        input: "5 0 7 3 7 0 1 0 0 0 4 0"
        non_zero_count: 6
        output: "1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0"
      - id: train_3
        input: "8 0 0 0 0 3 8 2 0 4 0 0"
        non_zero_count: 5
        output: "1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
      - id: train_7
        input: "5 9 0 0 6 1 0 1 5 2 9 0"
        non_zero_count: 8
        output: "1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0"
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept an input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize a counter variable `non_zero_count` to zero.
    3.  Iterate through each integer in the input sequence.
    4.  For each integer, if it is not equal to 0, increment `non_zero_count`.
    5.  Create a new output sequence.
    6.  Append the integer '1' to the output sequence `non_zero_count` times.
    7.  Calculate the number of zeros needed: `zero_count = 12 - non_zero_count`.
    8.  Append the integer '0' to the output sequence `zero_count` times.
    9.  Return the generated output sequence.
