Input:
  type: sequence # or numpy array
  elements: integers
  length: fixed (12 in examples)
  constraints: elements can be 0 or positive integers
Output:
  type: sequence # or numpy array
  elements: binary integers (0 or 1)
  length: same as input
Transformation:
  action: count non-zero elements in the input sequence
  intermediate_value: N (the count of non-zeros)
  output_generation:
    - create sequence of N ones
    - create sequence of (Length - N) zeros
    - concatenate the two sequences
Relationship:
  - object: InputSequence
    property: count_of_non_zeros (N)
  - object: OutputSequence
    property: consists of N leading '1's followed by (Length - N) '0's
