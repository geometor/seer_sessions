Both input and output sequences have the same fixed length (12 in the examples). The transformation rule appears to depend on the count of non-zero elements within the input sequence, rather than the specific values or positions of the non-zero elements themselves. Specifically, the number of '1's at the beginning of the output sequence corresponds directly to the total number of non-zero integers found anywhere in the input sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
