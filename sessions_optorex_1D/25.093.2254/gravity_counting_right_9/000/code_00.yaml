Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: integers
  length: fixed (12 in examples)
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: binary integers (0 or 1)
  length: same as input
Transformation:
  action: count non-zero elements in input
  result: determine the number of leading '1's in the output
Relationship:
  - object: InputSequence
    property: count_of_non_zeros (let's call it N)
  - object: OutputSequence
    property: first N elements are 1
    property: remaining elements are 0
