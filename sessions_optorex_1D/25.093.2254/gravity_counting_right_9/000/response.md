**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of input integers into a sequence of output binary digits (0s and 1s). Both input and output sequences have the same fixed length (12 in the examples). The transformation rule appears to depend on the count of non-zero elements within the input sequence, rather than the specific values or positions of the non-zero elements themselves. Specifically, the number of '1's at the beginning of the output sequence corresponds directly to the total number of non-zero integers found anywhere in the input sequence.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: integers
  length: fixed (12 in examples)
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: binary integers (0 or 1)
  length: same as input
Transformation:
  action: count non-zero elements in input
  result: determine the number of leading '1's in the output
Relationship:
  - object: InputSequence
    property: count_of_non_zeros (let's call it N)
  - object: OutputSequence
    property: first N elements are 1
    property: remaining elements are 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Count the total number of elements in the input sequence that are not equal to zero. Let this count be `N`.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
4.  Populate the first `N` positions of the output sequence with the value 1.
5.  Populate the remaining positions of the output sequence (from position `N` to the end) with the value 0.
6.  Return the generated output sequence.
