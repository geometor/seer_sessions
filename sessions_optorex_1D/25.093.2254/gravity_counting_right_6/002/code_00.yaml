task_description: Construct a binary sequence formatted as a space-separated string, based on the count of non-zero elements in an input sequence of integers.
elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    type: list of integers or numpy.ndarray # Adjusted based on error analysis
    properties:
      - length: N
      - contains_zeros: boolean (true if any element is 0)
      - contains_non_zeros: boolean (true if any element is not 0)
      - non_zero_count: integer (the number of elements not equal to 0)
  - object: output_sequence_list # Intermediate representation
    type: list of integers (binary: 0 or 1)
    properties:
      - length: N (same as input_sequence)
      - structure: consists of a prefix of '1's followed by a suffix of '0's
  - object: output_string
    type: string
    properties:
      - format: space-separated integers (0 or 1)
relationships:
  - type: length_conservation
    description: The length of the output_sequence_list is equal to the length of the input_sequence.
  - type: determination_of_ones
    description: The number of '1's in the output_sequence_list is equal to the non_zero_count of the input_sequence.
actions:
  - action: count_non_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_count (integer C)
    process: Iterate through the input sequence and count elements not equal to 0.
  - action: construct_output_list
    inputs:
      - sequence_length (integer N)
      - number_of_ones (integer C)
    output: output_sequence_list
    process: Create a list of length N containing C ones followed by (N - C) zeros.
  - action: format_output_string
    input: output_sequence_list
    output: output_string
    process: Convert each integer in the list to a string and join them with spaces.
