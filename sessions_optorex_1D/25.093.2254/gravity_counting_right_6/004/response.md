**General Assessment:**

The execution results consistently show a `TypeError` related to evaluating the truth value of an array. This indicates that the input provided to the `transform` function is not a standard Python list of integers, but rather a NumPy array. The previous code attempted to iterate through the input as if it were a list, leading to the comparison `x != 0` where `x` itself could be an array (or a sub-array depending on iteration method, though iterating a 1D numpy array usually yields elements), causing the ambiguity error when Python tried to evaluate the resulting boolean array in a conditional context.

The core transformation logic identified previously (counting non-zero elements and constructing the output based on this count) appears sound, as the manually verified counts match the expected outputs for all training examples. The fix involves adapting the implementation to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, specifically in the counting step.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `count_non_zeros` helper function (or integrate its logic directly into `transform`) to use NumPy's vectorized operations for counting non-zero elements. Methods like `np.count_nonzero()` or `np.sum(input_sequence != 0)` are suitable.
2.  Ensure the rest of the `transform` function correctly uses the non-zero count (`c`) and the total length (`n`, derived using `len()` or `input_sequence.size`) to construct the output list/array.
3.  Maintain the final output formatting as a space-separated string.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The previous analysis confirmed the input and output lengths are consistently 12 for all training examples. The key metric is the count of non-zero elements (`C`) in the input, which determines the number of leading '1's in the output.

| Example | Input                                | Length (N) | Non-Zero Count (C) | Expected Output                      | Matches Provided Output |
| :------ | :----------------------------------- | :--------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| train_1 | `5 0 3 0 0 7 3 2 0 7 0 7`            | 12         | 7                  | `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`            | Yes                     |
| train_2 | `5 0 3 3 8 5 9 2 5 0 7 6`            | 12         | 10                 | `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0`            | Yes                     |
| train_3 | `0 8 0 2 5 3 0 0 0 5 0 3`            | 12         | 6                  | `1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`            | Yes                     |
| train_4 | `8 8 0 0 0 5 0 7 3 3 8 0`            | 12         | 7                  | `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`            | Yes                     |
| train_5 | `0 0 0 0 1 7 4 0 8 8 0 3`            | 12         | 6                  | `1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`            | Yes                     |
| train_6 | `8 3 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 1 5 0`            | 12         | 6                  | `1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`            | Yes                     |
| train_7 | `0 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 6 2`            | 12         | 4                  | `1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`            | Yes                     |

The metrics confirm the transformation rule holds. The implementation error needs correction. Using `np.count_nonzero` is the most direct way to handle the NumPy input.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence, which is a NumPy array of integers.
2.  Determine the total number of elements in the input array (let this be `N`).
3.  Count the number of elements in the input array that are not equal to zero using a NumPy function (e.g., `numpy.count_nonzero`). Let this count be `C`.
4.  Create a new list.
5.  Append the integer `1` to the list `C` times.
6.  Append the integer `0` to the list `N - C` times.
7.  Convert each integer in the list to its string representation.
8.  Join the string representations with a single space in between.
9.  Return the resulting space-separated string.
