task_description: Construct a binary sequence based on the count of non-zero elements in an input integer sequence provided as a NumPy array.
elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray (1-dimensional array of integers)
    properties:
      - size: N (total number of elements)
      - non_zero_count: C (integer, number of elements != 0)
  - object: output_sequence
    type: list of integers (binary: 0 or 1)
    properties:
      - length: N (same as input_sequence.size)
      - structure: consists of a prefix of '1's followed by a suffix of '0's
relationships:
  - type: length_conservation
    description: The length of the output_sequence is equal to the size (N) of the input_sequence.
  - type: determination_of_ones
    description: The number of '1's in the output_sequence is equal to the non_zero_count (C) of the input_sequence.
actions:
  - action: count_non_zeros_numpy
    input: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    output: non_zero_count (integer C)
    method: Use numpy.count_nonzero(input_sequence)
  - action: construct_output
    inputs:
      - sequence_length (integer N)
      - number_of_ones (integer C)
    output: output_sequence (list of integers)
    process: Create a list containing C ones followed by (N - C) zeros.
  - action: format_output
    input: output_sequence (list of integers)
    output: formatted_string (space-separated string)
    process: Convert each integer in the list to a string and join with spaces.
