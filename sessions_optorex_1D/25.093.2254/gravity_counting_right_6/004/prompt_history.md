Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is a sequence of single-digit integers, presented as a space-separated string.
2.  **Output:** The output is also a sequence of integers, specifically only 0s and 1s, presented as a space-separated string.
3.  **Structure:** The input and output sequences consistently have the same length in all provided examples (length 12).
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output sequence appears to be constructed based on a property derived from the entire input sequence, rather than a direct mapping of each input element to its corresponding output element. Specifically, the output sequence always starts with a block of 1s followed by a block of 0s.
5.  **Key Observation:** The number of 1s at the beginning of the output sequence seems directly related to the number of non-zero elements in the input sequence.

**Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
task_description: Construct a binary sequence based on the count of non-zero elements in an input integer sequence.
elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: N
      - contains_zeros: boolean (true if any element is 0)
      - contains_non_zeros: boolean (true if any element is not 0)
      - non_zero_count: integer (the number of elements not equal to 0)
  - object: output_sequence
    type: list of integers (binary: 0 or 1)
    properties:
      - length: N (same as input_sequence)
      - structure: consists of a prefix of '1's followed by a suffix of '0's
relationships:
  - type: length_conservation
    description: The length of the output_sequence is equal to the length of the input_sequence.
  - type: determination_of_ones
    description: The number of '1's in the output_sequence is equal to the non_zero_count of the input_sequence.
actions:
  - action: count_non_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_count (integer C)
  - action: construct_output
    inputs:
      - sequence_length (integer N)
      - number_of_ones (integer C)
    output: output_sequence
    process: Create a sequence of length N containing C ones followed by (N - C) zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of integers.
2.  Calculate the total number of elements in the input sequence (let this be `N`).
3.  Count how many elements in the input sequence are not equal to zero (let this count be `C`).
4.  Generate an output sequence of length `N`.
5.  Set the first `C` elements of the output sequence to 1.
6.  Set the remaining `N - C` elements of the output sequence to 0.
7.  Return the generated output sequence.
