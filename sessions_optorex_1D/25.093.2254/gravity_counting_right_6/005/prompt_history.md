Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input:** The input is a sequence of single-digit integers, presented as a space-separated string.
2.  **Output:** The output is also a sequence of integers, specifically only 0s and 1s, presented as a space-separated string.
3.  **Structure:** The input and output sequences consistently have the same length in all provided examples (length 12).
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The output sequence appears to be constructed based on a property derived from the entire input sequence, rather than a direct mapping of each input element to its corresponding output element. Specifically, the output sequence always starts with a block of 1s followed by a block of 0s.
5.  **Key Observation:** The number of 1s at the beginning of the output sequence seems directly related to the number of non-zero elements in the input sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The execution results consistently show a `TypeError` related to evaluating the truth value of an array. This indicates that the input provided to the `transform` function is not a standard Python list of integers, but rather a NumPy array. The previous code attempted to iterate through the input as if it were a list, leading to the comparison `x != 0` where `x` itself could be an array (or a sub-array depending on iteration method, though iterating a 1D numpy array usually yields elements), causing the ambiguity error when Python tried to evaluate the resulting boolean array in a conditional context.

The core transformation logic identified previously (counting non-zero elements and constructing the output based on this count) appears sound, as the manually verified counts match the expected outputs for all training examples. The fix involves adapting the implementation to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, specifically in the counting step.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `count_non_zeros` helper function (or integrate its logic directly into `transform`) to use NumPy's vectorized operations for counting non-zero elements. Methods like `np.count_nonzero()` or `np.sum(input_sequence != 0)` are suitable.
2.  Ensure the rest of the `transform` function correctly uses the non-zero count (`c`) and the total length (`n`, derived using `len()` or `input_sequence.size`) to construct the output list/array.
3.  Maintain the final output formatting as a space-separated string.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The previous analysis confirmed the input and output lengths are consistently 12 for all training examples. The key metric is the count of non-zero elements (`C`) in the input, which determines the number of leading '1's in the output.

| Example | Input                                | Length (N) | Non-Zero Count (C) | Expected Output                      | Matches Provided Output |

| train_6 | `8 3 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 1 5 0`            | 12         | 6                  | `1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`            | Yes                     |
| train_7 | `0 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 6 2`            | 12         | 4                  | `1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`            | Yes                     |

The metrics confirm the transformation rule holds. The implementation error needs correction. Using `np.count_nonzero` is the most direct way to handle the NumPy input.
