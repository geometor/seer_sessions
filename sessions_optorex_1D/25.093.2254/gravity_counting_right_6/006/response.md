**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The core logic identified in the initial analysis (counting non-zero elements in the input sequence to determine the number of leading '1's in the output sequence, with the remaining elements being '0's, preserving the total length) appears correct and holds true for all provided training examples.

The errors encountered (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...`) strongly suggest a mismatch between the expected input type/format of the `transform` function in the provided Python code and the actual input provided during testing, or an issue in the testing harness itself interpreting the output. The Python code's type hint `input_sequence: np.ndarray` indicates it expects a NumPy array, while the task examples clearly show space-separated string inputs. The error message containing the *expected output string* is unusual and might indicate the test harness is incorrectly trying to parse the expected output string, but the most likely cause related to the *submitted code* is the input type mismatch.

**Strategy:**
1.  Re-affirm the core transformation logic based on the consistent pattern across all examples.
2.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to explicitly state that the input is a space-separated string of integers and the output is also a space-separated string of binary digits (0s and 1s).
3.  Modify the Python code implementation to correctly handle string input parsing before applying the transformation logic.

**Metrics:**

Based on the `tool_code` execution:

```
[{'input': '5 0 3 0 0 7 3 2 0 7 0 7', 'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 7},
 {'input': '5 0 3 3 8 5 9 2 5 0 7 6', 'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 10},
 {'input': '0 8 0 2 5 3 0 0 0 5 0 3', 'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 6},
 {'input': '8 8 0 0 0 5 0 7 3 3 8 0', 'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 7},
 {'input': '0 0 0 0 1 7 4 0 8 8 0 3', 'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 6},
 {'input': '8 3 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 1 5 0', 'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 6},
 {'input': '0 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 6 2', 'length': 12, 'non_zero_count': 4}]
```


*   **Consistency:** All input examples have a length of 12.
*   **Correlation:** The `non_zero_count` in each input consistently matches the number of leading '1's in the corresponding expected output string.
*   **Input Format:** The inputs are presented as space-separated strings.
*   **Output Format:** The outputs are presented as space-separated strings of '0's and '1's.

task_description: >
  Transform a space-separated string of integers into a space-separated binary string (0s and 1s).
  The output string has the same number of elements as the input string.
  The number of leading '1's in the output string equals the count of non-zero integers in the input string.
  The remaining elements in the output string are '0's.
elements:
  - object: input_string
    type: string
    format: space-separated integers (e.g., "5 0 3 0 ...")
    properties:
      - parsed_sequence: list of integers
      - length: N (number of integers in the string)
      - non_zero_count: C (count of integers != 0)
  - object: output_string
    type: string
    format: space-separated binary digits (e.g., "1 1 0 0 ...")
    properties:
      - length: N (same as input_string's parsed_sequence length)
      - structure: Consists of C '1's followed by (N - C) '0's.
relationships:
  - type: length_conservation

  - type: determination_of_ones
    description: The count of leading '1's in the output_string is determined by the non_zero_count of the input_string's parsed_sequence.
actions:

  - action: construct_output_sequence
    inputs:
      - number_of_ones (integer C)
      - total_length (integer N)
    output: output_list (list of C ones followed by N-C zeros)
    process: Create a list containing C integers with value 1, followed by (N - C) integers with value 0.

    input: output_list
    output: output_string
    process: Convert the list of binary integers into a space-separated string.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a single string containing space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string into a list of individual integers.
3.  Determine the total number of integers in the list (let this be `N`).
4.  Count how many integers in the list are not equal to zero (let this count be `C`).
5.  Create a new list.
6.  Append the integer `1` to the new list `C` times.
7.  Append the integer `0` to the new list `N - C` times.
8.  Convert the elements of the new list back into strings.
9.  Join these strings together with a single space between each element to form the final output string.
10. Return the final output string.
