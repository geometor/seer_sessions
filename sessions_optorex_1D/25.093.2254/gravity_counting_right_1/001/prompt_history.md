**Perception of Elements:**

The input consists of a sequence of single digits presented as a space-separated string. The output is also a space-separated string of the same length as the input, but composed solely of '1's and '0's. The core transformation appears to involve counting certain elements in the input and representing this count structurally in the output. Specifically, it seems related to identifying non-zero digits in the input.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Generate a binary sequence based on the count of non-zero elements in an input sequence."
input_structure:
  type: string
  format: space-separated digits
  elements: integers (0-9)
  length: fixed (12 in examples)
output_structure:
  type: string
  format: space-separated digits
  elements: binary digits ('1' or '0')
  length: same as input
transformation:
  action: count
  operand: non-zero digits in the input sequence
  result_mapping:
    - description: "The count of non-zero digits determines the number of leading '1's in the output."
      value: count_of_non_zeros
      output_position: beginning of the sequence
    - description: "The remaining positions in the output are filled with '0's."
      value: '0'
      output_position: following the leading '1's
relationship:
  - input_element_value: non-zero
  - output_prefix_length: count of non-zero input elements
  - output_suffix_length: total_length - count of non-zero input elements
constants:
  output_digits: ['1', '0']
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and split it into a list of individual digit strings.
2.  Convert each digit string to an integer.
3.  Initialize a counter for non-zero digits to zero.
4.  Iterate through the list of integers. For each integer, if it is not equal to 0, increment the non-zero counter.
5.  Determine the total number of digits in the input list (let this be `L`).
6.  Create a new output list.
7.  Append the character '1' to the output list `N` times, where `N` is the final count of non-zero digits.
8.  Append the character '0' to the output list `L - N` times.
9.  Join the elements of the output list with spaces to form the final output string.
