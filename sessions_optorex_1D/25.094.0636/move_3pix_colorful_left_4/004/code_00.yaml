task_elements:
  - item: grid
    properties:
      - type: 2D array of digits
      - dimensions: 4 rows x 3 columns
      - source: input string parsed row by row
      - representation: space-separated string of 12 digits (row-major order)
  - item: cell
    properties:
      - type: element within the grid
      - content: single digit (0-9)
  - item: zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: background / empty space
  - item: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
      - role: content / foreground object part
  - item: non_zero_cells
    properties:
      - type: collection of cells
      - condition: cell value is not 0
  - item: bounding_box
    properties:
      - type: rectangular subgrid
      - definition: the smallest rectangle containing all non_zero_cells
      - coordinates: (min_row, min_col) to (max_row, max_col) derived from non_zero_cells
      - content: the portion of the input grid within these coordinates
      - edge_case: If no non_zero_cells exist, the bounding box is undefined or empty.
  - item: transformation
    properties:
      - type: positional shift
      - target: the bounding_box of non_zero_cells
      - action: move the bounding_box and its content
      - direction: upwards (decrease row index)
      - magnitude: 1 row
      - boundary_condition: the top row of the shifted box cannot be less than 0 (i.e., min_row after shift is max(0, original_min_row - 1))
      - column_position: remains unchanged (min_col is preserved)
      - output_generation: create a new 4x3 grid filled with zeros, then place the shifted bounding_box content into it.
relationships:
  - The output grid is derived from the input grid by calculating the bounding_box of non_zero_cells and shifting its content vertically.
  - The relative positions of non_zero_digits within the bounding_box are preserved during the shift.
  - Cells outside the shifted bounding_box in the output grid are always zero.
  - If the input grid contains only zeros, the output grid also contains only zeros.
