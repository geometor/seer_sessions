In the provided examples, the length is 12.\n3.  **Core Content**: The non-zero digits from the input seem to be preserved in the output, maintaining their relative order. Zeros are also present in both input and output.\n4.  **Transformation**: The primary transformation appears to be a positional shift of a specific segment of the input sequence. This segment contains the core non-zero content.\n5.  **Identifying the Segment**: The segment being moved seems to start at the first non-zero digit in the input and end at the last non-zero digit in the input, inclusive of any zeros *between* these two points.\n6.  **Shift Amount**: In all examples, this identified segment is shifted exactly 3 positions to the left.\n7.  **Padding**: The output sequence is constructed by placing the shifted segment at its new position. All other positions in the output sequence (before or after the shifted segment) are filled with zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
