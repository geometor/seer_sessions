Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format**: Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Sequence Length**: The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence. In the provided examples, the length is 12.
3.  **Core Content**: The non-zero digits from the input seem to be preserved in the output, maintaining their relative order. Zeros are also present in both input and output.
4.  **Transformation**: The primary transformation appears to be a positional shift of a specific segment of the input sequence. This segment contains the core non-zero content.
5.  **Identifying the Segment**: The segment being moved seems to start at the first non-zero digit in the input and end at the last non-zero digit in the input, inclusive of any zeros *between* these two points.
6.  **Shift Amount**: In all examples, this identified segment is shifted exactly 3 positions to the left.
7.  **Padding**: The output sequence is constructed by placing the shifted segment at its new position. All other positions in the output sequence (before or after the shifted segment) are filled with zeros.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains: digits (0-9)
  - object: segment
    properties:
      - definition: sub-sequence from the first non-zero digit to the last non-zero digit in the input sequence.
      - includes: all digits (zeros and non-zeros) within its boundaries.
      - relationship: part of the input sequence.
  - object: zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: can be part of the segment or padding outside the segment.
  - object: non-zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
      - role: define the start and end boundaries of the segment.
      - relationship: relative order is preserved during transformation.
actions:
  - action: identify_segment
    input: input sequence
    output: the segment (sub-sequence)
    steps:
      - find the index of the first non-zero digit.
      - find the index of the last non-zero digit.
      - extract the sub-sequence between these indices (inclusive).
  - action: shift_segment
    input: segment, shift amount
    output: shifted segment position
    details:
      - shift_amount: fixed value (3 positions)
      - direction: left
  - action: construct_output
    input: sequence length, shifted segment, start index of shifted segment
    output: output sequence
    steps:
      - create a new sequence of the original length, filled with zeros.
      - place the shifted segment into the new sequence starting at the calculated left-shifted index.
relationships:
  - input sequence and output sequence have the same length.
  - the relative order of digits within the identified segment is preserved in the output.
  - the segment is moved 3 positions to the left relative to its original position in the input.
constants:
  - shift_amount: 3
  - shift_direction: left
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
3.  Identify the index of the first non-zero digit in the input sequence. If no non-zero digits exist, the output is identical to the input (a sequence of all zeros).
4.  Identify the index of the last non-zero digit in the input sequence.
5.  Extract the sub-sequence (the "segment") from the input sequence starting at the index of the first non-zero digit and ending at the index of the last non-zero digit (inclusive).
6.  Calculate the target starting index for the segment in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from the original starting index of the segment. Ensure the target index is not less than 0.
7.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled entirely with zeros.
8.  Place the extracted segment into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index.
9.  Return the newly constructed output sequence.
```python
import math # common math library available

"""
Identify the contiguous segment in the input list that starts with the first non-zero digit 
and ends with the last non-zero digit. Shift this entire segment 3 positions to the left, 
handling boundary conditions (cannot shift past index 0). Create an output list of the 
same length as the input, filled with zeros, and place the shifted segment into it.
If the input list contains only zeros, return a list of zeros of the same length.
