Specifically, the sequence seems to be shifted or rotated.\n*   **Identifying the Pattern:** Comparing input and output across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: the entire sequence of 12 digits is shifted cyclically to the left by 3 positions. The digits that move off the beginning wrap around to the end.\n\n    *   Example 1: `0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 8 0 0 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `0 0 0 1 6 8 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Example 3: `0 0 0 7 7 2 2 8 0 0 0 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `7 7 2 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    *   Example 6: `0 0 0 8 3 8 4 6 8 4 9 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `8 3 8 4 6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0`\n    This cyclic left shift holds true for all provided training pairs.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
