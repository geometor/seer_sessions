objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - name: elements
        type: integer
        description: Single digits (0-9).
      - name: length
        value: 12
        description: The fixed number of elements in the sequence.

actions:
  - name: cyclic_left_shift
    description: Shifts the elements of the sequence to the left, with elements moving off the start wrapping around to the end.
    parameters:
      - name: sequence
        type: object
        description: The input sequence to be shifted.
      - name: shift_amount
        value: 3
        type: integer
        description: The number of positions to shift the sequence to the left.
    output:
      - name: shifted_sequence
        type: object
        description: The sequence after the cyclic left shift operation.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by applying a specific action.
    applies_to:
      - input_sequence: sequence
      - output_sequence: shifted_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is the result of applying a cyclic_left_shift action with a shift_amount of 3 to the input sequence.
