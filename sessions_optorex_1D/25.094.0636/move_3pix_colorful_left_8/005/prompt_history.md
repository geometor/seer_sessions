Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit numbers, represented as space-separated strings.
*   **Core Observation:** The digits within the sequence appear to be rearranged, but the digits themselves are preserved. Specifically, the sequence seems to be shifted or rotated.
*   **Identifying the Pattern:** Comparing input and output across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: the entire sequence of 12 digits is shifted cyclically to the left by 3 positions. The digits that move off the beginning wrap around to the end.

    *   Example 1: `0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 8 0 0 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `0 0 0 1 6 8 0 0 0 0 0 0`
    *   Example 3: `0 0 0 7 7 2 2 8 0 0 0 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `7 7 2 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
    *   Example 6: `0 0 0 8 3 8 4 6 8 4 9 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `8 3 8 4 6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0`
    This cyclic left shift holds true for all provided training pairs.

**General Assessment:**

The analysis of the provided training examples and the corresponding expected outputs strongly indicates a consistent transformation rule. The initial hypothesis of a cyclic left shift by 3 positions accurately describes the relationship between the input and the *expected* output for all 7 training cases.

The results provided from the execution of `code_00.py` show a significant discrepancy: the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input` in every case, indicating that the transformation logic within that specific code execution failed or was bypassed. The errors (`Match: False`, `Pixels Off: >0`) reported are therefore artifacts of this failed execution, not evidence against the originally deduced transformation rule.

The strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule based on the input/expected output pairs and refine the documentation (YAML, natural language program) to clearly state this rule for the coder phase. The failure of `code_00.py` should be noted as an implementation issue, separate from the task rule definition.

**Metrics:**

Based on the comparison between the `Input` and `Expected Output` for each example:

**Metrics Summary:**

*   **Consistency:** All 7 training examples consistently follow the pattern of a cyclic left shift by 3 positions.
*   **Mechanism:** In each case, the first 3 elements of the input sequence become the last 3 elements of the output sequence, and the remaining 9 elements (from index 3 onwards) shift left to form the beginning of the output sequence.
*   **Length:** Both input and output sequences consistently have a length of 12 elements.
*   **Elements Changed Position:** The number of elements whose position changes between the input and expected output varies (6, 10, 8, 9, 6, 9, 8). This number precisely matches the `Pixels Off` reported by the faulty `code_00.py` run (because the faulty run returned the input, the difference between the faulty output and expected output is the same as the difference between the input and expected output).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input, which is a sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the first 3 digits of the sequence (elements at index 0, 1, and 2).
3.  Identify the remaining 9 digits of the sequence (elements from index 3 to 11).
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing the 9 digits (from step 3) in their original relative order.
5.  Append the 3 digits (from step 2) to the end of the sequence constructed in step 4, maintaining their original relative order.
6.  Return the newly constructed sequence of 12 digits as the output.
