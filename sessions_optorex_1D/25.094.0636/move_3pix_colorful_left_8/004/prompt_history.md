Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit numbers, represented as space-separated strings.
*   **Core Observation:** The digits within the sequence appear to be rearranged, but the digits themselves are preserved. Specifically, the sequence seems to be shifted or rotated.
*   **Identifying the Pattern:** Comparing input and output across all examples reveals a consistent pattern: the entire sequence of 12 digits is shifted cyclically to the left by 3 positions. The digits that move off the beginning wrap around to the end.

    *   Example 1: `0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 8 0 0 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `0 0 0 1 6 8 0 0 0 0 0 0`
    *   Example 3: `0 0 0 7 7 2 2 8 0 0 0 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `7 7 2 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
    *   Example 6: `0 0 0 8 3 8 4 6 8 4 9 0` -> The first three '0's move to the end. -> `8 3 8 4 6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0`
    This cyclic left shift holds true for all provided training pairs.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Perform a cyclic left shift on the sequence by 3 positions. This means moving the first 3 digits to the end of the sequence in their original order, and shifting all other digits 3 positions to the left.
3.  The resulting sequence is the output.
