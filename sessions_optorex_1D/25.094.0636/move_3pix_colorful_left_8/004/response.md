**General Assessment:**

The analysis of the provided training examples and the corresponding expected outputs strongly indicates a consistent transformation rule. The initial hypothesis of a cyclic left shift by 3 positions accurately describes the relationship between the input and the *expected* output for all 7 training cases.

The results provided from the execution of `code_00.py` show a significant discrepancy: the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input` in every case, indicating that the transformation logic within that specific code execution failed or was bypassed. The errors (`Match: False`, `Pixels Off: >0`) reported are therefore artifacts of this failed execution, not evidence against the originally deduced transformation rule.

The strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule based on the input/expected output pairs and refine the documentation (YAML, natural language program) to clearly state this rule for the coder phase. The failure of `code_00.py` should be noted as an implementation issue, separate from the task rule definition.

**Metrics:**

Based on the comparison between the `Input` and `Expected Output` for each example:

``` python
import numpy as np

def analyze_shift(input_str, expected_output_str, shift_amount=3):
    input_list = input_str.split()
    expected_output_list = expected_output_str.split()

    if len(input_list) != 12 or len(expected_output_list) != 12:
        return {"error": "Invalid length", "consistent_shift": False}

    # Check if first 'shift_amount' elements of input match last 'shift_amount' of output
    wrap_around_match = input_list[:shift_amount] == expected_output_list[-shift_amount:]

    # Check if elements from 'shift_amount' onwards in input match first elements of output
    main_part_match = input_list[shift_amount:] == expected_output_list[:-shift_amount]

    # Calculate how many elements are *not* in their original position
    diff_count = sum(1 for i, (inp_el, out_el) in enumerate(zip(input_list, expected_output_list)) if inp_el != out_el)

    # Calculate the difference based on the failed code run (for comparison)
    # We use the provided 'Pixels Off' values from the problem description
    pixels_off_reported = {
        1: 6, 2: 10, 3: 8, 4: 9, 5: 6, 6: 9, 7: 8
    }

**Metrics Summary:**

*   **Consistency:** All 7 training examples consistently follow the pattern of a cyclic left shift by 3 positions.
*   **Mechanism:** In each case, the first 3 elements of the input sequence become the last 3 elements of the output sequence, and the remaining 9 elements (from index 3 onwards) shift left to form the beginning of the output sequence.
*   **Length:** Both input and output sequences consistently have a length of 12 elements.
*   **Elements Changed Position:** The number of elements whose position changes between the input and expected output varies (6, 10, 8, 9, 6, 9, 8). This number precisely matches the `Pixels Off` reported by the faulty `code_00.py` run (because the faulty run returned the input, the difference between the faulty output and expected output is the same as the difference between the input and expected output).

execution_notes:
  - note: Previous execution attempt (`code_00.py`) failed to apply the transformation, returning the input unchanged. This issue was likely in the implementation, not the rule definition. The rule described here is based on the provided Input -> Expected Output pairs.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input, which is a sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the first 3 digits of the sequence (elements at index 0, 1, and 2).
3.  Identify the remaining 9 digits of the sequence (elements from index 3 to 11).
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing the 9 digits (from step 3) in their original relative order.
5.  Append the 3 digits (from step 2) to the end of the sequence constructed in step 4, maintaining their original relative order.
6.  Return the newly constructed sequence of 12 digits as the output.
