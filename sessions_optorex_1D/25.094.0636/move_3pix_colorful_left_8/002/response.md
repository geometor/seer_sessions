**General Assessment:**

The previous attempt failed because the code assumed the input was a string of space-separated digits. The error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicate that the actual input format is a NumPy array. The core transformation logic identified (a cyclic left shift by 3 positions) appears consistent across the examples, but the implementation must be adapted to work with NumPy arrays or lists derived from them, rather than string manipulation. The strategy is to adjust the data handling part of the transformation while retaining the core cyclic shift logic.

**Metrics:**

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`).
*   **Input Shape:** Based on the examples, the input is consistently a 1D array of length 12.
*   **Output Type:** The output should likely also be a NumPy array of the same shape (1D, length 12).
*   **Transformation:** Cyclic left shift.
*   **Shift Amount:** 3 positions.
*   **Error Consistency:** The same error occurred for all examples, confirming the input type mismatch is the sole issue identified so far.

    applies_to:

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input, which is a 1D NumPy array containing 12 integer digits.
2.  Perform a cyclic left shift on the elements of the array by 3 positions.
3.  To achieve this:
    *   Select the elements from index 3 to the end of the array.
    *   Select the first 3 elements (indices 0, 1, 2) of the array.
    *   Concatenate the first selection (elements from index 3 onwards) followed by the second selection (first 3 elements).
4.  Return the resulting 1D NumPy array of 12 digits.
