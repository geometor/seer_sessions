objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: array # Updated from string/list derived from string
    properties:
      - name: elements
        type: integer
        description: Single digits (0-9).
      - name: length
        value: 12
        description: The fixed number of elements in the sequence.
      - name: format
        value: numpy.ndarray # Explicitly state the format
        description: The data structure holding the sequence.

actions:
  - name: cyclic_left_shift
    description: Shifts the elements of the sequence array to the left, with elements moving off the start wrapping around to the end.
    parameters:
      - name: sequence_array
        type: object
        properties_ref: sequence # Reference the sequence object definition
        description: The input NumPy array to be shifted.
      - name: shift_amount
        value: 3
        type: integer
        description: The number of positions to shift the sequence to the left.
    output:
      - name: shifted_array # Updated name
        type: object
        properties_ref: sequence # Output has same properties
        description: The NumPy array after the cyclic left shift operation.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    description: The output array is derived from the input array by applying a specific action.
    applies_to:
      - input_array: sequence_array
      - output_array: shifted_array
    rule: The output array is the result of applying a cyclic_left_shift action with a shift_amount of 3 to the input array.
