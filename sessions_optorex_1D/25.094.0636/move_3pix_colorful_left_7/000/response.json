This segment includes any zeros that fall between the first and last non-zero digits.\n*   The position of this significant segment changes from the input to the output. Specifically, it appears to be shifted three positions to the left.\n*   The length of the sequence remains constant (12 digits).\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
