"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 digits based on the following rule:
Identify the sub-sequence spanning from the first non-zero digit to the last non-zero digit in the input sequence.
Calculate a target start index by subtracting 3 (shift_amount) from the index of the first non-zero digit.
Construct the output sequence of length 12, initially filled with zeros.
Place the identified sub-sequence into the output sequence starting at the target start index.
Handle boundary conditions: If the target start index is negative, truncate the beginning of the sub-sequence before placing it (starting placement at index 0). If placing the sub-sequence exceeds the sequence length, truncate the end of the sub-sequence.
If the input sequence contains no non-zero digits, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
