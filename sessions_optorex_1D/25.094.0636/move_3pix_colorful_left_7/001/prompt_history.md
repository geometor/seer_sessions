Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   The input and output are both sequences of 12 digits, represented as space-separated strings.
*   Each sequence contains digits from 0 to 9.
*   The core transformation involves identifying a specific contiguous sub-sequence within the input and relocating it within the output sequence.
*   The digits '0' primarily function as padding or placeholders.
*   The significant part of the sequence appears to be the segment starting with the first non-zero digit and ending with the last non-zero digit. This segment includes any zeros that fall between the first and last non-zero digits.
*   The position of this significant segment changes from the input to the output. Specifically, it appears to be shifted three positions to the left.
*   The length of the sequence remains constant (12 digits).

      - output_sequence: a sequence of length 12, padded with zeros, containing the core_data_block at the output_start_index
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: extract the sub-sequence between the first and last non-zero digits and shift it 3 positions to the left, padding the remaining positions with zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the input sequence. If no non-zero digit exists, the sequence remains unchanged (all zeros).
3.  Find the index of the last non-zero digit in the input sequence.
4.  Extract the sub-sequence from the input sequence starting at the first non-zero index and ending at the last non-zero index (inclusive).
5.  Determine the target starting index for this sub-sequence in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from the first non-zero index found in step 2.
6.  Create a new output sequence containing 12 zeros.
7.  Place the extracted sub-sequence into the new output sequence, beginning at the calculated target starting index.
8.  Output the resulting sequence.
