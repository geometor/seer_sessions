**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating sequences of single-digit numbers. Each input is a sequence of 12 digits, represented as strings separated by spaces. The output is also a sequence of 12 digits, containing the same digits as the input but in a different order. The core operation appears to be a specific type of rotation or shift applied to the sequence. Observing the examples, it consistently seems that the first three elements of the input sequence are relocated to the end of the sequence, while the remaining elements shift leftward to fill the gap, maintaining their relative order.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of strings (representing single digits)
  Length: 12
  Elements: Digits from '0' to '9'
  Structure: Linear sequence

Output:
  Type: List of strings (representing single digits)
  Length: 12
  Elements: Same digits as input, but reordered
  Structure: Linear sequence

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic shift (rotation)
  Object: Input sequence
  Details:
    - Identify the first three elements of the input sequence.
    - Identify the remaining elements (from the 4th to the 12th).
    - Construct the output sequence by concatenating the remaining elements followed by the first three elements.
  Properties:
    - Preserves the count of each digit.
    - Preserves the relative order of the elements *within* the first three elements.
    - Preserves the relative order of the elements *within* the remaining nine elements.
    - Moves the first three elements as a block to the end.

Examples_Analyzed:
  - train_1: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.
  - train_2: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.
  - train_3: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Separate the sequence into two parts:

3.  Create the output sequence by appending Part A to the end of Part B.
4.  Format the output sequence with spaces between the digits.

## Example 1:
Error: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The error "only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars" across all examples strongly indicates that the input `input_grid` provided to the `transform` function is not a 1D list or array of numbers as initially coded for, but rather a 2D NumPy array. The previous code failed at the list comprehension step `[str(int(x)) for x in output_array]` because `x` was an array (likely a row or column slice), not a single scalar number that `int()` could process.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge that the input is a 2D NumPy array. Based on the visual representation, it's likely a 1x12 or 12x1 array.
2.  Modify the process to correctly handle the 2D input. The most straightforward way is to flatten the input array into a 1D array at the beginning.
3.  Perform the rotation logic (moving the first 3 elements to the end) on the flattened 1D array.
4.  Convert the elements of the resulting 1D array to strings and join them with spaces.
5.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this understanding.

**Metrics and Input Confirmation:**

Using the `tool_code` confirms that if the input string `0 0 0 7 3 6 4 8 2 0 0 0` is loaded as a NumPy array `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 6, 4, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0]])`, its shape is `(1, 12)`. Slicing and concatenating along `axis=1` works, but iterating directly for `int()` conversion fails. Flattening the array (`output_array.flatten()`) before the list comprehension resolves the error. The same resolution applies if the input were a `(12, 1)` array.

*   **Input Shape (Hypothesized & Confirmed):** 2D NumPy array (e.g., (1, 12) or (12, 1)).
*   **Input Data Type:** Numerical (integers).
*   **Output Format:** Space-separated string of digits.
*   **Core Logic:** Cyclic left shift by 3 positions.
*   **Error Cause:** Attempting scalar conversion ( `int()` ) on array elements during iteration over a 2D array.
*   **Resolution:** Flatten the array before converting elements to strings.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation on a 2D Grid

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Shape: 2D (commonly 1xN or Nx1, specifically 1x12 or 12x1 in examples)
  Elements: Numerical digits (integers)
  Structure: Represents a linear sequence visually, but stored in 2D.

Output:
  Type: String
  Content: Space-separated sequence of digits.
  Length: Corresponds to the total number of elements in the input grid (12 in examples).

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic shift (rotation) applied to the *flattened* sequence representation of the grid.
  Object: The sequence of elements derived from the input grid.
  Details:
    - Flatten the 2D input grid into a 1D sequence of numbers.
    - Identify the first three elements of the 1D sequence.
    - Identify the remaining elements (from the 4th to the last).
    - Construct the transformed 1D sequence by concatenating the remaining elements followed by the first three elements.
    - Convert each number in the transformed 1D sequence to its string representation.
    - Join the string representations with single spaces.
  Properties:
    - Preserves the count of each digit.
    - Preserves the relative order of elements *within* the first three elements.
    - Preserves the relative order of elements *within* the remaining elements.
    - Moves the first three elements (in flattened order) as a block to the end.

Examples_Analyzed:
  - All examples consistently show the first three elements of the flattened sequence being moved to the end.
  - Error analysis confirms the input structure is 2D NumPy array, requiring flattening before element-wise processing for string conversion.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input 2D NumPy grid.
2.  Flatten the grid into a 1D NumPy array (sequence of numbers).
3.  Separate the 1D array into two parts:
    *   Part A: The first three numbers.
    *   Part B: The remaining numbers (from the 4th element to the end).
4.  Create a new 1D array by concatenating Part B followed by Part A.
5.  Convert each number in this new 1D array into its string representation.
6.  Join these strings together, separated by single spaces, to form the final output string.
7.  Return the output string.
