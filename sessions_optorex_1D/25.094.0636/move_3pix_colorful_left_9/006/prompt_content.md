Transforms a 2D NumPy grid representing a sequence of digits by flattening it, performing a cyclic left shift of 3 positions on the flattened sequence, and returning the result as a space-separated string. The first three elements of the flattened sequence are moved to the end, maintaining the relative order of both the moved block and the remaining elements.
