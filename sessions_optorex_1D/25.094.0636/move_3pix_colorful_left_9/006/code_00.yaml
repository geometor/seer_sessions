Task: Sequence Transformation (String-based)

Input:
  Type: String
  Content: Sequence of single digits separated by spaces.
  Length: Exactly 12 digits (represented as characters).
  Structure: Linear sequence within the string.

Output:
  Type: String
  Content: Sequence of single digits separated by spaces, representing the transformed input.
  Length: Exactly 12 digits (represented as characters).
  Elements: Same digits as input, but reordered.
  Structure: Linear sequence within the string.

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic left shift on the sequence of digits.
  Amount: Shift by 3 positions.
  Details:
    - Parse the input string into a list of digit strings (split by space).
    - Identify the first three elements (Part A).
    - Identify the remaining nine elements (Part B).
    - Construct the output list by concatenating Part B followed by Part A.
    - Join the elements of the output list back into a single string separated by spaces.
  Properties:
    - Preserves the count of each digit character.
    - Preserves the relative order within the first three elements.
    - Preserves the relative order within the remaining nine elements.
    - Moves the block of the first three elements to the end.

Examples_Analyzed:
  - All 7 examples consistently show the first 3 space-separated elements moving to the end of the sequence.
  - The error messages confirm the target output format for each case aligns with this rule.
