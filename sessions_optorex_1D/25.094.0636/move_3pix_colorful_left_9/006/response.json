            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '...'` consistently occurs across all examples. This error arises when the `int()` function receives a string that cannot be parsed as a single integer. In this context, the code is incorrectly trying to convert the entire space-separated output string (e.g., \"7 3 6 4 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\") into an integer.\n\nThis indicates a misunderstanding in the previous step about the input data type being passed *to* the `transform` function during testing. The function was designed to handle a NumPy array, flatten it, process it, and return a string. However, the test environment seems to be passing the raw input string directly, or there's a flaw in how the intermediate results are handled, leading to `int()` being called on the final, already correctly formatted, string.\n\nThe core transformation logic (moving the first three elements to the end) appears correct, as the strings shown in the error messages match the expected output format for each example.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Revert the function signature and internal logic to accept a single string as input and return a single string as output.\n2.  Remove any NumPy-specific operations like `flatten()` or conversions assuming numerical array inputs.\n3.  Focus on string manipulation: split the input string, rearrange the resulting list of digit strings, and join them back into the output string.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the provided examples and error messages:\n\n*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be a single string containing 12 space-separated digits.\n*   **Output Type:** Expected to be a single string containing 12 space-separated digits.\n*   **Element Count:** Consistently 12 elements (digits) in both input and output.\n*   **Transformation Consistency:** The pattern of moving the first 3 elements to the end holds true for all 7 training examples, as evidenced by the expected output strings shown in the error logs.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
