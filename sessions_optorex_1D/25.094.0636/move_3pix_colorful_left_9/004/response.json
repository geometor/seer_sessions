            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error \"only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\" across all examples strongly indicates that the input `input_grid` provided to the `transform` function is not a 1D list or array of numbers as initially coded for, but rather a 2D NumPy array. The previous code failed at the list comprehension step `[str(int(x)) for x in output_array]` because `x` was an array (likely a row or column slice), not a single scalar number that `int()` could process.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge that the input is a 2D NumPy array. Based on the visual representation, it's likely a 1x12 or 12x1 array.\n2.  Modify the process to correctly handle the 2D input. The most straightforward way is to flatten the input array into a 1D array at the beginning.\n3.  Perform the rotation logic (moving the first 3 elements to the end) on the flattened 1D array.\n4.  Convert the elements of the resulting 1D array to strings and join them with spaces.\n5.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this understanding.\n\n**Metrics and Input Confirmation:**\n\nUsing the `tool_code` confirms that if the input string `0 0 0 7 3 6 4 8 2 0 0 0` is loaded as a NumPy array `np.array([[0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 6, 4, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0]])`, its shape is `(1, 12)`. Slicing and concatenating along `axis=1` works, but iterating directly for `int()` conversion fails. Flattening the array (`output_array.flatten()`) before the list comprehension resolves the error. The same resolution applies if the input were a `(12, 1)` array.\n\n*   **Input Shape (Hypothesized & Confirmed):** 2D NumPy array (e.g., (1, 12) or (12, 1)).\n*   **Input Data Type:** Numerical (integers).\n*   **Output Format:** Space-separated string of digits.\n*   **Core Logic:** Cyclic left shift by 3 positions.\n*   **Error Cause:** Attempting scalar conversion ( `int()` ) on array elements during iteration over a 2D array.\n*   **Resolution:** Flatten the array before converting elements to strings.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
