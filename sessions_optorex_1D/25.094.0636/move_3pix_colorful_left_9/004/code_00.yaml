Task: Sequence Transformation on a 2D Grid

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Shape: 2D (commonly 1xN or Nx1, specifically 1x12 or 12x1 in examples)
  Elements: Numerical digits (integers)
  Structure: Represents a linear sequence visually, but stored in 2D.

Output:
  Type: String
  Content: Space-separated sequence of digits.
  Length: Corresponds to the total number of elements in the input grid (12 in examples).

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic shift (rotation) applied to the *flattened* sequence representation of the grid.
  Object: The sequence of elements derived from the input grid.
  Details:
    - Flatten the 2D input grid into a 1D sequence of numbers.
    - Identify the first three elements of the 1D sequence.
    - Identify the remaining elements (from the 4th to the last).
    - Construct the transformed 1D sequence by concatenating the remaining elements followed by the first three elements.
    - Convert each number in the transformed 1D sequence to its string representation.
    - Join the string representations with single spaces.
  Properties:
    - Preserves the count of each digit.
    - Preserves the relative order of elements *within* the first three elements.
    - Preserves the relative order of elements *within* the remaining elements.
    - Moves the first three elements (in flattened order) as a block to the end.

Examples_Analyzed:
  - All examples consistently show the first three elements of the flattened sequence being moved to the end.
  - Error analysis confirms the input structure is 2D NumPy array, requiring flattening before element-wise processing for string conversion.
