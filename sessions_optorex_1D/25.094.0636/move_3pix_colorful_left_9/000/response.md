**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating sequences of single-digit numbers. Each input is a sequence of 12 digits, represented as strings separated by spaces. The output is also a sequence of 12 digits, containing the same digits as the input but in a different order. The core operation appears to be a specific type of rotation or shift applied to the sequence. Observing the examples, it consistently seems that the first three elements of the input sequence are relocated to the end of the sequence, while the remaining elements shift leftward to fill the gap, maintaining their relative order.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of strings (representing single digits)
  Length: 12
  Elements: Digits from '0' to '9'
  Structure: Linear sequence

Output:
  Type: List of strings (representing single digits)
  Length: 12
  Elements: Same digits as input, but reordered
  Structure: Linear sequence

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic shift (rotation)
  Object: Input sequence
  Details:
    - Identify the first three elements of the input sequence.
    - Identify the remaining elements (from the 4th to the 12th).
    - Construct the output sequence by concatenating the remaining elements followed by the first three elements.
  Properties:
    - Preserves the count of each digit.
    - Preserves the relative order of the elements *within* the first three elements.
    - Preserves the relative order of the elements *within* the remaining nine elements.
    - Moves the first three elements as a block to the end.

  - train_1: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.
  - train_2: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.
  - train_3: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.
  - train_4: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.
  - train_5: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.
  - train_6: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.
  - train_7: First three '0 0 0' moved to end.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Separate the sequence into two parts:
    *   Part A: The first three digits.
    *   Part B: The remaining nine digits (from the 4th to the 12th).
3.  Create the output sequence by appending Part A to the end of Part B.
4.  Format the output sequence with spaces between the digits.
