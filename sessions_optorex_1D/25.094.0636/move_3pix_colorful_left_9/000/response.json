Each input is a sequence of 12 digits, represented as strings separated by spaces. The output is also a sequence of 12 digits, containing the same digits as the input but in a different order. The core operation appears to be a specific type of rotation or shift applied to the sequence. Observing the examples, it consistently seems that the first three elements of the input sequence are relocated to the end of the sequence, while the remaining elements shift leftward to fill the gap, maintaining their relative order.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
