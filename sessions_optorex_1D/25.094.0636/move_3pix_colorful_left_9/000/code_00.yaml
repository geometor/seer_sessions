Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of strings (representing single digits)
  Length: 12
  Elements: Digits from '0' to '9'
  Structure: Linear sequence

Output:
  Type: List of strings (representing single digits)
  Length: 12
  Elements: Same digits as input, but reordered
  Structure: Linear sequence

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic shift (rotation)
  Object: Input sequence
  Details:
    - Identify the first three elements of the input sequence.
    - Identify the remaining elements (from the 4th to the 12th).
    - Construct the output sequence by concatenating the remaining elements followed by the first three elements.
  Properties:
    - Preserves the count of each digit.
    - Preserves the relative order of the elements *within* the first three elements.
    - Preserves the relative order of the elements *within* the remaining nine elements.
    - Moves the first three elements as a block to the end.
