Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: numpy.ndarray
  Shape: (12,)
  DType: Numerical (likely integer or float representing digits)
  Elements: Digits from 0 to 9
  Structure: 1D array

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated single digits
  Length: 12 digits represented as characters, plus 11 spaces
  Elements: Same digits as input, but reordered

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic shift (rotation) on a 1D NumPy array
  Object: Input NumPy array
  Details:
    - Identify the first three elements of the input array (slice `[:3]`).
    - Identify the remaining nine elements of the input array (slice `[3:]`).
    - Construct the output array by concatenating the remaining elements slice followed by the first three elements slice (e.g., using `np.concatenate`).
    - Convert each element in the resulting NumPy array to its string representation.
    - Join the string representations with a single space delimiter to form the final output string.
  Properties:
    - Preserves the count of each digit value.
    - Moves the first three elements as a block to the end.
    - Maintains the relative order of the first three elements amongst themselves.
    - Maintains the relative order of the last nine elements amongst themselves.

Examples_Analyzed:
  - All examples consistently show the first 3 elements moving to the end.
  - Error messages confirm input type is numpy.ndarray.
  - Output format is consistently a space-separated string.
