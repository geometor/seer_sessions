Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, presented as space-separated strings. All sequences have the same length (12 elements in the examples).
*   **Content:** The sequences contain digits, including zeros. The non-zero digits seem to maintain their relative order from input to output.
*   **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, it appears that the elements are being shifted to the left. The elements that "fall off" the beginning reappear at the end, preserving the overall set of elements and their count. This suggests a cyclic or rotational shift.
*   **Shift Amount:** By comparing the position of the first few elements in the input with their position in the output (e.g., in `train_1`, the `0` at index 3 moves to index 0, the `0` at index 4 moves to index 1, etc., *or* looking at it differently, the first three `0`s move to the end), the shift amount appears to be consistently 3 positions to the left.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - sequence:
      description: A list of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the sequence.
        - length: The number of elements (appears constant for a given task instance, 12 in examples).
        - order: Elements have a specific order/position.
actions:
  - shift:
      description: Elements change their position within the sequence.
      type: Cyclic Left Shift
      parameters:
        - amount: The number of positions to shift (3 in this case).
      effect: The first 'amount' elements are moved to the end of the sequence in their original relative order. The remaining elements shift 'amount' positions to the left.
relationships:
  - input_output: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by applying the shift action.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of digits.
2.  Perform a cyclic left shift on the sequence by 3 positions.
3.  The resulting sequence is the output.
```python
"""
Takes an input sequence of digits (represented as a space-separated string) 
and performs a cyclic left shift on the sequence by 3 positions. The first 
3 elements are moved to the end of the sequence, and the remaining elements 
shift 3 positions to the left. The resulting sequence is returned as a 
space-separated string.
"""

    # 1. Parse the input string into a list of elements (strings initially).
