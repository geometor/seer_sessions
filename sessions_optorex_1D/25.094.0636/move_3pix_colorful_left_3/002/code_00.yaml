objects:
  - sequence:
      description: A 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual integers in the array.
        - length: The number of elements (12 in all examples).
        - order: Elements have a specific order/position.
actions:
  - shift:
      description: Elements change their position within the sequence array.
      type: Cyclic Left Shift
      parameters:
        - amount: The number of positions to shift (fixed at 3).
      effect: The first 3 elements of the input array are moved to the end of the array in their original relative order. The remaining elements shift 3 positions to the left to fill the vacated space.
relationships:
  - input_output: The output array is derived from the input array by applying the cyclic left shift action.
