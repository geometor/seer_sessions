            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary issue identified is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function receives a NumPy array, not a space-separated string as initially perceived.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm that the core transformation logic (cyclic left shift by 3 positions) remains valid across all provided examples.\n2.  Update the understanding of the input object to be a NumPy array.\n3.  Revise the natural language program and supporting documentation (YAML facts) to accurately reflect the input type and the operation performed on it. The subsequent Coder phase will then need to adapt the Python code to handle NumPy arrays correctly, likely by converting the array to a list for easier slicing/concatenation or using NumPy's own array manipulation functions (like `np.roll`).\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Confirmed as `numpy.ndarray` for all examples based on the error.\n*   **Input Length:** All provided training examples have an input array length of 12.\n*   **Output Length:** All provided training examples have an output array length of 12.\n*   **Transformation Consistency:** Visual inspection confirms that in every example, the output is generated by moving the first 3 elements of the input array to the end, effectively performing a cyclic left shift by 3 positions. The relative order of the elements is preserved.\n\n"
