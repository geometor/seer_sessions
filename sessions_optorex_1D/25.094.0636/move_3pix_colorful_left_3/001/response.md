"""
Takes an input sequence of digits (represented as a space-separated string) 
and performs a cyclic left shift on the sequence by 3 positions. The first 
3 elements are moved to the end of the sequence, and the remaining elements 
shift 3 positions to the left. The resulting sequence is returned as a 
space-separated string.
