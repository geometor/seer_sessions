All sequences have the same length (12 elements in the examples).\n*   **Content:** The sequences contain digits, including zeros. The non-zero digits seem to maintain their relative order from input to output.\n*   **Transformation:** Comparing inputs and outputs, it appears that the elements are being shifted to the left. The elements that \"fall off\" the beginning reappear at the end, preserving the overall set of elements and their count. This suggests a cyclic or rotational shift.\n*   **Shift Amount:** By comparing the position of the first few elements in the input with their position in the output (e.g., in `train_1`, the `0` at index 3 moves to index 0, the `0` at index 4 moves to index 1, etc., *or* looking at it differently, the first three `0`s move to the end), the shift amount appears to be consistently 3 positions to the left.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
