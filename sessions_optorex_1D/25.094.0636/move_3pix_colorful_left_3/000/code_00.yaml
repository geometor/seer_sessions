objects:
  - sequence:
      description: A list of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The individual digits in the sequence.
        - length: The number of elements (appears constant for a given task instance, 12 in examples).
        - order: Elements have a specific order/position.
actions:
  - shift:
      description: Elements change their position within the sequence.
      type: Cyclic Left Shift
      parameters:
        - amount: The number of positions to shift (3 in this case).
      effect: The first 'amount' elements are moved to the end of the sequence in their original relative order. The remaining elements shift 'amount' positions to the left.
relationships:
  - input_output: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by applying the shift action.
