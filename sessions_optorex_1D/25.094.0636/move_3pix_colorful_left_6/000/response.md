*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 single digits.
    *   The digits themselves are preserved; the transformation involves rearranging their positions.
    *   The core operation is identifying a specific segment within the input sequence and shifting it.
    *   The digit '0' acts as a background or filler element.
    *   The segment being moved consists of all digits between the first non-zero digit and the last non-zero digit (inclusive) in the input sequence.
    *   This identified segment is consistently shifted 3 positions to the left.
    *   Positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted segment are filled with '0'.

    actions:

        outputs: start_index, end_index, segment_data
        description: Find the index of the first non-zero digit (start_index) and the last non-zero digit (end_index). Extract the subsequence between these indices.
      - name: calculate_new_position
        inputs: start_index
        outputs: new_start_index
        description: Subtract 3 from the start_index, ensuring the result is not less than 0. (new_start_index = max(0, start_index - 3))
      - name: construct_output
        inputs: segment_data, new_start_index, sequence_length (12)

        description: Create a sequence of length 12 filled with zeros. Place the segment_data into this sequence starting at new_start_index.
    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        applies_to: input_sequence
        results_in: output_sequence
        rule: The output sequence is generated by identifying the non_zero_segment in the input, shifting it left by 3 positions (respecting boundary at index 0), and padding the remaining positions with zeros.
    constants:
      - name: shift_amount
        value: 3
      - name: direction
        value: left
      - name: sequence_length
        value: 12
      - name: padding_value
        value: 0

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    2.  Scan the input sequence to find the index of the first non-zero digit (`start_index`). If no non-zero digits exist, the output is the sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Scan the input sequence (or scan backwards from the end) to find the index of the last non-zero digit (`end_index`).
    4.  Extract the segment of the input sequence from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). This segment includes any zeros between the first and last non-zero digits.
    5.  Calculate the target starting index for this segment in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from `start_index`. The target index cannot be less than 0, so use `max(0, start_index - 3)`.
    6.  Copy the extracted segment into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target index.
    7.  Return the modified output sequence.
