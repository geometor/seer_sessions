"""
Transforms a 1x12 grid of digits based on the following rule:
1. Identify the horizontal segment (sub-array) within the single row, starting from the column of the first non-zero element and ending at the column of the last non-zero element. This segment includes any zeros within it.
2. If no non-zero elements are found in the row, the output is a 1x12 grid of zeros.
3. Calculate the target starting column index for this segment in the output grid by subtracting 3 from the original starting column index. Ensure the target index is not less than 0 (i.e., use max(0, original_start_col_index - 3)).
4. Construct the output grid of shape 1x12, initially filled with zeros.
5. Place the extracted segment into the first (and only) row of the output grid starting at the calculated target column index.
6. Return the resulting grid.
