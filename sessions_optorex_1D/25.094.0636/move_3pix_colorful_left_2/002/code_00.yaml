    description: >
      The output_array is derived from the input_array by performing
      a left cyclic shift operation. The first 3 elements of the input
      array are moved to the end of the array, preserving their order,
      and all other elements are shifted 3 positions to the left. This
      can be achieved using array slicing and concatenation or numpy's
      np.roll function with a negative shift value.
