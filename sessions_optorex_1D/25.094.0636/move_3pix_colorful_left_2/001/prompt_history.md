**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of integers into another sequence of the same length. The key elements are:
1.  **Input Sequence:** A list of integers.
2.  **Output Sequence:** A list of integers derived from the input.
3.  **Transformation:** An operation that rearranges the elements of the input sequence.
4.  **Integers:** The individual numbers within the sequence, including zeros and non-zeros.
5.  **Position/Index:** The location of each integer within the sequence.

Observing the examples reveals a consistent pattern: the elements of the input sequence appear to be shifted cyclically to the left. Specifically, the first three elements of the input sequence are moved to the end, maintaining their relative order, while the remaining elements shift three positions to the left. This operation is consistent across all provided training pairs.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - contains: integers
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in the examples)
  - type: sequence
    name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - contains: integers
      - length: same as input_sequence
relationship:
  - type: transformation
    action: cyclic_shift
    direction: left
    amount: 3
    description: >
      The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by performing
      a left cyclic shift operation. The first 3 elements of the input
      sequence are moved to the end of the sequence, preserving their order,
      and all other elements are shifted 3 positions to the left.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
2.  Perform a left cyclic shift on the sequence by 3 positions.
    *   Specifically, move the elements at index 0, 1, and 2 to the end of the sequence, placing them at indices n-3, n-2, and n-1 (where n is the length of the sequence), maintaining their original relative order.
    *   Shift the elements originally from index 3 to n-1 three positions to the left, placing them at indices 0 to n-4.
3.  The resulting sequence is the output.
