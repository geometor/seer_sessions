task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    name: input_sequence
    properties:
      - contains: integers
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in the examples)
  - type: sequence
    name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - contains: integers
      - length: same as input_sequence
relationship:
  - type: transformation
    action: cyclic_shift
    direction: left
    amount: 3
    description: >
      The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by performing
      a left cyclic shift operation. The first 3 elements of the input
      sequence are moved to the end of the sequence, preserving their order,
      and all other elements are shifted 3 positions to the left.
