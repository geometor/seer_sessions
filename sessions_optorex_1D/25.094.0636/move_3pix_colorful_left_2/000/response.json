The key elements are:\n1.  **Input Sequence:** A list of integers.\n2.  **Output Sequence:** A list of integers derived from the input.\n3.  **Transformation:** An operation that rearranges the elements of the input sequence.\n4.  **Integers:** The individual numbers within the sequence, including zeros and non-zeros.\n5.  **Position/Index:** The location of each integer within the sequence.\n\nObserving the examples reveals a consistent pattern: the elements of the input sequence appear to be shifted cyclically to the left. Specifically, the first three elements of the input sequence are moved to the end, maintaining their relative order, while the remaining elements shift three positions to the left. This operation is consistent across all provided training pairs.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
