Each input sequence contains a contiguous block of non-zero digits, potentially surrounded by leading and/or trailing zeros. The corresponding output sequence has the same length and contains the same non-zero digits in the same relative order, but the entire block of non-zero digits has been shifted to the left. The number of positions shifted appears constant across all examples. The zeros that were originally to the left of the non-zero block, along with any zeros within the block (though none appear in these examples), and those displaced by the shift effectively move to the end of the sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
