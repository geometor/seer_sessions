**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating sequences of single-digit integers. Each input sequence contains a contiguous block of non-zero digits, potentially surrounded by leading and/or trailing zeros. The corresponding output sequence has the same length and contains the same non-zero digits in the same relative order, but the entire block of non-zero digits has been shifted to the left. The number of positions shifted appears constant across all examples. The zeros that were originally to the left of the non-zero block, along with any zeros within the block (though none appear in these examples), and those displaced by the shift effectively move to the end of the sequence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - contains_digits_0_to_9
      - fixed_length_across_input_output
      - contains_a_contiguous_block_of_non_zero_digits
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub_sequence_of_integers
    properties:
      - extracted_from_input_sequence
      - contains_only_digits_1_to_9
      - maintains_relative_order_of_digits
      - has_a_start_index_in_input
      - has_an_end_index_in_input
  - name: zero_digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value_is_0
      - acts_as_padding

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index
    description: Find the first and last non-zero digits in the input sequence to define the block.
  - name: shift_block_left
    input: non_zero_block, start_index
    parameter: shift_amount (constant value of 3)
    output: new_start_index
    description: Calculate the new starting position of the non_zero_block by subtracting the shift_amount from the original start_index.
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    input: non_zero_block, new_start_index, sequence_length
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a new sequence of the original length, placing the non_zero_block at the new_start_index and filling the remaining positions with zeros, primarily at the end.

relationships:
  - input_sequence contains non_zero_block
  - output_sequence contains non_zero_block at a shifted position
  - length(input_sequence) == length(output_sequence)
  - shift_amount is constant (3) across all examples
  - relative_order(non_zero_digits_in_input) == relative_order(non_zero_digits_in_output)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous sub-sequence of non-zero digits within the input sequence. Note its starting and ending indices.
2.  Determine the target starting index for this non-zero block in the output sequence by subtracting 3 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
3.  Construct the output sequence of the same length as the input sequence.
4.  Place the identified non-zero block into the output sequence starting at the calculated target starting index.
5.  Fill all remaining positions in the output sequence with zeros. These zeros will occupy the positions before the target start index (if any) and all positions after the end of the placed non-zero block.
