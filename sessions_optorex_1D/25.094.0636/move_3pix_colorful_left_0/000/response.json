There might also be zeros interspersed within or immediately following the non-zero digits that seem to be part of a \"block\".\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of a specific part of the input sequence.\n4.  **Identifying the \"Block\":** The significant part of the sequence seems to start from the *first* non-zero digit encountered when reading from left to right. This block extends from that first non-zero digit all the way to the end of the input sequence.\n5.  **The Shift:** This identified block is moved 3 positions to the left in the output sequence.\n6.  **Padding:** Zeros are used to fill the space. The number of leading zeros in the output corresponds to the new starting position of the block. Trailing zeros are added to ensure the output sequence also has a length of 12.\n7.  **Edge Case:** If the input sequence consists entirely of zeros, the output is identical (all zeros). This fits the general rule if we consider that no block is identified to be shifted.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
