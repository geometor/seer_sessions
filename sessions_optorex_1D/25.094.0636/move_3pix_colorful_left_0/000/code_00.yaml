task_description: "Shift a trailing sub-sequence (starting from the first non-zero digit) left by 3 positions within a fixed-length digit list."
elements:
  - object: digit_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list
      - item_type: integer (0-9)
      - length: 12
      - role: container for digits (input or output)
  - object: zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: padding (leading/trailing), potential part of the active_block
  - object: non_zero_digit
    properties:
      - value: integer (1-9)
      - role: marker, content
  - object: active_block
    properties:
      - type: sub-sequence
      - definition: The portion of the input sequence starting from the index of the first non-zero digit found, extending to the end of the sequence.
      - contains: The first non-zero digit and all subsequent digits (including zeros) from the input.
    relationships:
      - determined_by: position of the first non-zero digit
  - object: position
    properties:
      - type: index (0-based)
      - role: location identifier within the sequence
actions:
  - action: identify_first_non_zero_index
    description: Find the index of the first digit greater than 0 in the input sequence.
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: start_index (or indication of none found)
  - action: extract_active_block
    description: Get the sub-sequence from the identified start_index to the end of the input sequence.
    inputs: input_sequence, start_index
    outputs: active_block (sub-sequence)
  - action: shift_block_position
    description: Calculate the new starting index for the active_block in the output.
    inputs: start_index
    calculation: new_start_index = start_index - 3
    outputs: new_start_index
  - action: construct_output_sequence
    description: Assemble the final 12-digit output sequence.
    steps:
      - If no non-zero digit was found in the input, return the input sequence directly.
      - Otherwise, create a new list.
      - Add 'new_start_index' number of zeros to the list.
      - Append the 'active_block' to the list.
      - Append trailing zeros until the list length is 12.
    inputs: new_start_index, active_block, original_input (for edge case)
    outputs: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    subject: active_block
    direction: left
    magnitude: 3 indices
    reference_point: start_index of the block in the input vs. output
