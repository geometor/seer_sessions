            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code implementation failed across all examples with a `ValueError` related to NumPy array truth values. This error typically arises when a NumPy array containing multiple elements is used in a context requiring a single boolean (e.g., `if some_array:`). However, the provided Python code uses standard list operations and element-wise comparisons (`if digit != 0:`), which *should* also work correctly with NumPy arrays element by element, returning scalar booleans. The simulation confirms this.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests either:\n1.  The execution environment passes data in an unexpected format (not a simple 1D list/array).\n2.  The error originates from the testing harness itself, not the `transform` function's core logic.\n3.  There's a subtle interaction not captured in the simulation.\n\nDespite the runtime error, visual inspection and step-by-step application of the previously defined logic confirm that the core transformation rule (find first non-zero, extract block, shift left by 3, pad with zeros) correctly explains the input-to-output mapping for all provided training examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the core transformation logic described previously, as it accurately reflects the pattern observed in the data. The Natural Language Program and YAML facts will be refined for clarity but will retain the same fundamental steps. The implementation issue will be noted as a concern for the Coder phase, potentially requiring adaptation to handle NumPy arrays explicitly or debug the interaction with the execution environment.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe core logic was manually verified against each example:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,3,9,3,9,8,2,4]`. First non-zero: 3 at index 5. Block: `[3,9,3,9,8,2,4]`. Shift left by 3 -> new start index 2. Output: `[0,0] + [3,9,3,9,8,2,4] + [0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,3,9,3,9,8,2,4,0,0,0]`. Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,8,7,4,5,1,2,0]`. First non-zero: 8 at index 5. Block: `[8,7,4,5,1,2,0]`. Shift left by 3 -> new start index 2. Output: `[0,0] + [8,7,4,5,1,2,0] + [0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,8,7,4,5,1,2,0,0,0,0]`. Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,2,6,8,0,0,0,0]`. First non-zero: 2 at index 5. Block: `[2,6,8,0,0,0,0]`. Shift left by 3 -> new start index 2. Output: `[0,0] + [2,6,8,0,0,0,0] + [0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,2,6,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`. Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 4:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,6,4,0,0]`. First non-zero: 1 at index 6. Block: `[1,1,6,4,0,0]`. Shift left by 3 -> new start index 3. Output: `[0,0,0] + [1,1,6,4,0,0] + [0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,0,1,1,6,4,0,0,0,0,0]`. Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 5:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7,9,1]`. First non-zero: 3 at index 8. Block: `[3,7,9,1]`. Shift left by 3 -> new start index 5. Output: `[0,0,0,0,0] + [3,7,9,1] + [0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,0,0,0,3,7,9,1,0,0,0]`. Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 6:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,0,5,9,1,5,0,0]`. First non-zero: 5 at index 6. Block: `[5,9,1,5,0,0]`. Shift left by 3 -> new start index 3. Output: `[0,0,0] + [5,9,1,5,0,0] + [0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,0,5,9,1,5,0,0,0,0,0]`. Matches expected output.\n*   **Example 7:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,9,4,0,0,0]`. First non-zero: 7 at index 6. Block: `[7,9,4,0,0,0]`. Shift left by 3 -> new start index 3. Output: `[0,0,0] + [7,9,4,0,0,0] + [0,0,0]` -> `[0,0,0,7,9,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]`. Matches expected output.\n\nAll examples consistently follow the \"shift left by 3\" rule applied to the block starting from the first non-zero digit.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
