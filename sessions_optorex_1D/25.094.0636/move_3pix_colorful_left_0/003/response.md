"""
Transform a sequence of 12 digits based on the following rules:

1. Define the fixed sequence length as 12 and the shift amount as 3 positions to the left.
2. Iterate through the input sequence (list or array of 12 digits) from the beginning (index 0) to find the index of the first digit that is not 0. Let this be `start_index`.
3. Case 1: No non-zero digit found. If all digits in the input sequence are 0, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
4. Case 2: Non-zero digit found at `start_index`.
    a. Extract the `active_block`, which is the sub-sequence containing all digits from `start_index` to the end of the input sequence.
    b. Calculate the target starting position for this block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index - 3`.
    c. Construct the output sequence (length 12):
        i. Start with `new_start_index` zeros.
        ii. Append the `active_block`.
        iii. Append trailing zeros until the total length of the output sequence reaches 12.
5. Return the constructed output sequence.
