objects:
  - name: input_array
    type: numpy.ndarray[int]
    description: A 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers representing the input sequence.
  - name: output_array
    type: numpy.ndarray[int]
    description: A 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers representing the transformed output sequence.
  - name: digit_zero
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: The integer value 0.
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: int
    description: Any integer element in the array not equal to 0.
properties:
  - name: length
    description: The number of elements in an array. (Consistent between input and output).
  - name: index
    description: The position of an element within an array (0-based).
  - name: value
    description: The integer value of an element in the array.
actions:
  - name: find_first_non_zero_index
    actor: system
    input: input_array
    output: index (k)
    description: Identify the index `k` of the first element in the input array that is not equal to 0. Returns -1 if all elements are 0.
  - name: construct_output_array
    actor: system
    input: input_array, index (k)
    output: output_array
    description: >
      Constructs the output array based on the input array and the index `k` of the first non-zero element.
      If k is -1, the output array is identical to the input array.
      Otherwise, the output array is formed by concatenating the slice of the input array before index k,
      a single zero element, and the slice of the input array from index k up to (but not including) the last element.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_array
    to: output_array
    rule: >
      The output array is derived from the input array by finding the index `k` of the first non-zero element.
      The elements before index `k` are kept, followed by a 0, followed by the elements from index `k` up to the second-to-last element of the original input array.
      This preserves the length of the array. If no non-zero element exists, the output is identical to the input.
  - type: constraint
    element: output_array
    property: length
    value: length(input_array)
    description: The output array must have the same number of elements as the input array.
