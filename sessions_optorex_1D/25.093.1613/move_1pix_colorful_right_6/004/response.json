            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary issue identified by the execution results was an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The `transform` function expected `bytes` and attempted to use `.decode()`, but the actual input provided by the execution environment was a `numpy.ndarray`. This caused the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'decode'` error across all examples, preventing any validation of the transformation logic itself.\n\nFurther analysis, comparing the input and output sequences directly, revealed that the initial hypothesis (\"insert '0' before the first non-zero digit\") was incomplete. While a '0' appears at the position of the first non-zero digit, the output sequence maintains the *same length* as the input sequence. This implies that the operation is not a simple insertion but rather a replacement and shift: the first non-zero digit is effectively replaced by '0', and subsequent digits are shifted one position to the right, with the original last digit being dropped.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Input Handling**: Modify the `transform` function to accept a `numpy.ndarray` as input. Remove the `.decode()` call and any string parsing logic (like `re.findall`).\n2.  **Refine Transformation Logic**: Implement the revised understanding:\n    *   Find the index `k` of the first non-zero element.\n    *   If no non-zero element exists (index `k` is -1, though this case isn't shown in examples), return the input array unchanged.\n    *   Otherwise, construct the output array by concatenating:\n        *   The slice of the input array before index `k` (`input_array[0:k]`).\n        *   A single element array containing `0` (`np.array([0])`).\n        *   The slice of the input array from index `k` up to the second-to-last element (`input_array[k:-1]`).\n3.  **Ensure Output Format**: The output should likely be a `numpy.ndarray` to match the input type and the structure observed in the examples.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by analyzing the input/output pairs based on the revised transformation rule:\n\n| Example | Input                                         | Output                                        | Input Len | Output Len | First Non-Zero Index (k) | Correctly Transformed? |\n| :------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------- |\n| 1       | `[0,4,6,3,4,1,2,3,8,7,8,0]`                   | `[0,0,4,6,3,4,1,2,3,8,7,8]`                   | 12        | 12         | 1                        | Yes                    |\n| 2       | `[0,7,2,8,6,6,3,1,5,2,6,0]`                   | `[0,0,7,2,8,6,6,3,1,5,2,6]`                   | 12        | 12         | 1                        | Yes                    |\n| 3       | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8,7,2,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,8,7,2]`                   | 12        | 12         | 7                        | Yes                    |\n| 4       | `[0,0,0,5,8,2,2,2,9,3,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,5,8,2,2,2,9,3,0]`                   | 12        | 12         | 3                        | Yes                    |\n| 5       | `[0,0,0,2,1,4,9,9,6,9,8,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,2,1,4,9,9,6,9,8]`                   | 12        | 12         | 3                        | Yes                    |\n| 6       | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,9,4,5,6,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,4,5,6,0]`                   | 12        | 12         | 6                        | Yes                    |\n| 7       | `[0,6,8,2,4,6,3,9,8,0,0,0]`                   | `[0,0,6,8,2,4,6,3,9,8,0,0]`                   | 12        | 12         | 1                        | Yes                    |\n\n**Summary**: All provided examples consistently follow the rule: find the first non-zero element, replace it with zero, shift subsequent elements right by one position, and discard the original last element, maintaining the original sequence length.\n\n**YAML Fact Document**\n\n"
