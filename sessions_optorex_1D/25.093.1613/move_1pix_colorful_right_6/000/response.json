Comparing the input and output sequences reveals that the output is always one digit longer than the input. Specifically, a single '0' digit is inserted into the input sequence to produce the output. The position of this insertion appears to be related to the location of the first non-zero digit in the input sequence.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
