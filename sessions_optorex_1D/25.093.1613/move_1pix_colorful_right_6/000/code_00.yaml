objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A sequence of single digits provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The sequence of single digits produced as output.
  - name: digit_zero
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: The digit '0'.
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: int
    description: Any digit from 1 to 9.
properties:
  - name: length
    description: The number of digits in a sequence.
  - name: index
    description: The position of a digit within a sequence (0-based).
  - name: value
    description: The numerical value of a digit.
actions:
  - name: find_first_non_zero_index
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    output: index
    description: Identify the index of the first digit in the input sequence that is not '0'.
  - name: insert_digit
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    object: digit_zero
    position: index (determined by find_first_non_zero_index)
    output: output_sequence
    description: Insert the digit '0' into the input sequence at the specified index.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is generated by inserting a '0' into the input sequence immediately before the first non-zero digit.
  - type: determination
    element: insertion_index
    determined_by: index of the first non_zero_digit in input_sequence
