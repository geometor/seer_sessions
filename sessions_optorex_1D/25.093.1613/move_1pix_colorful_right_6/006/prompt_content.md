"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of integers by finding the index 'k' of the first non-zero element. 
If found (k >= 0), the output array is constructed by taking the elements before index k, 
appending 0, and then appending the elements from index k up to the second-to-last element 
of the input array. This preserves the original length. If no non-zero element is found (k = -1), 
the output array is identical to the input array.
