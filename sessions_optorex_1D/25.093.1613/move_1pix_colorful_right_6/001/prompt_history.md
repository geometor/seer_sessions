**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits. Both input and output are strings of space-separated digits. Comparing the input and output sequences reveals that the output is always one digit longer than the input. Specifically, a single '0' digit is inserted into the input sequence to produce the output. The position of this insertion appears to be related to the location of the first non-zero digit in the input sequence.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A sequence of single digits provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The sequence of single digits produced as output.
  - name: digit_zero
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: The digit '0'.
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: int
    description: Any digit from 1 to 9.
properties:
  - name: length
    description: The number of digits in a sequence.
  - name: index
    description: The position of a digit within a sequence (0-based).
  - name: value
    description: The numerical value of a digit.
actions:
  - name: find_first_non_zero_index
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    output: index
    description: Identify the index of the first digit in the input sequence that is not '0'.
  - name: insert_digit
    actor: system
    target: input_sequence
    object: digit_zero
    position: index (determined by find_first_non_zero_index)
    output: output_sequence
    description: Insert the digit '0' into the input sequence at the specified index.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is generated by inserting a '0' into the input sequence immediately before the first non-zero digit.
  - type: determination
    element: insertion_index
    determined_by: index of the first non_zero_digit in input_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of digits.
2.  Locate the index (position) of the first digit in the sequence that is not equal to '0'.
3.  Construct the output sequence by inserting a single '0' digit into the input sequence at the identified index. The original digits from that index onwards are shifted one position to the right.
4.  Return the resulting sequence.
