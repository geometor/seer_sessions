This error occurred consistently across all examples.\n    *   This indicates that the `transform` function, specifically the `parse_input_string` helper function it calls, was designed to accept a *string* representation of the sequence (e.g., `\"0 0 0 0 6 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\"`). However, during the testing phase, the input was provided as a *NumPy array* (or a similar list-like structure) of integers.\n    *   The core transformation logic (shifting elements right, prepending 0, dropping the last element) described in the previous natural language program appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs.\n    *   The strategy for resolution is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input, removing the unnecessary string parsing step.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    *   All inputs are sequences of length 12.\n    *   All outputs are sequences of length 12.\n    *   All elements are integers between 0 and 9.\n    *   In each case, `output[0]` is 0.\n    *   In each case, `output[1:]` is identical to `input[:-1]`.\n    *   The error type (`TypeError`) confirms the input type mismatch. No computation is needed to verify the transformation rule itself, as it's visually confirmed and the error is purely technical.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
