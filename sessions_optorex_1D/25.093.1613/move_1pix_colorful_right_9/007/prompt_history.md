*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of integers, specifically digits from 0 to 9.
    *   Both input and output sequences have a fixed length of 12 elements.
    *   The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the elements within the sequence.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs, the sequence of numbers in the input seems to move one position to the right in the output.
    *   A '0' is always present at the beginning of the output sequence.
    *   The last element of the input sequence is consistently absent from the output sequence.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed because it assumed the input to the `transform` function was already a list or array of integers. However, the error messages ("Input sequence must have exactly 12 elements, got 1") indicate that the function received the input as a single entity (likely the raw string representation of the sequence). The core transformation logic identified previously (right shift by one, prepend with 0, discard the last element) appears correct based on visual inspection of the examples, but it could not be applied due to the input type mismatch.

    The strategy is to:
    1.  Modify the process to correctly parse the input string into a sequence (list) of integers.
    2.  Apply the previously determined transformation logic to this sequence.
    3.  Format the resulting sequence back into a space-separated string for the output.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    The inputs and outputs are consistently strings containing 12 space-separated integers.
