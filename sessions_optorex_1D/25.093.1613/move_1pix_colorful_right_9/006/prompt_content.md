"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers by shifting the elements one position to the right, 
inserting a 0 at the beginning, and discarding the last element of the original sequence.
Specifically, it takes the first 11 elements of the input sequence and prepends a 0 to form the output sequence.
