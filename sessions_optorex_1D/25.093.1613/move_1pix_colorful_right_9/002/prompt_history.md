*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of integers, specifically digits from 0 to 9.
    *   Both input and output sequences have a fixed length of 12 elements.
    *   The core transformation appears to be a positional shift of the elements within the sequence.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs, the sequence of numbers in the input seems to move one position to the right in the output.
    *   A '0' is always present at the beginning of the output sequence.
    *   The last element of the input sequence is consistently absent from the output sequence.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Given an input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Create a new sequence by taking the first 11 integers from the input sequence (discarding the 12th integer).
    3.  Insert the integer 0 at the beginning of this new sequence.
    4.  Return the resulting 12-integer sequence as the output.
```python
"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers by shifting the elements one position to the right, 
inserting a 0 at the beginning, and discarding the last element of the original sequence.
