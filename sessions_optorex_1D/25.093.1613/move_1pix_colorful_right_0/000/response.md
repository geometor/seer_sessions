Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The primary objects are sequences of single digits (0-9). These sequences are represented as strings with space delimiters.
*   **Properties:** Each sequence has a fixed length (12 in all examples). The digits within the sequence can be zero or non-zero. The position (index) of each digit is important. We can identify leading zeros, trailing zeros, and a "core" block of non-zero digits (potentially interspersed with zeros).
*   **Actions:** The core action appears to be a positional shift or insertion/deletion operation based on the location of non-zero digits. Specifically, a '0' seems to be inserted, and an element seems to be removed to maintain the sequence length.
*   **Relationships:** The output sequence is derived directly from the input sequence by rearranging elements based on the position of the first and last non-zero digits. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Shift a block of numbers within a sequence and adjust length."
elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - content: list of single digits (0-9)
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - structure: ordered
      - representation: space-separated string
  - type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - significance: zero vs. non-zero
  - type: sub-sequence
    definition: "The contiguous block starting from the first non-zero digit and ending with the last non-zero digit in the input sequence."
    properties:
      - start_index: index of the first non-zero digit
      - end_index: index of the last non-zero digit
actions:
  - name: identify_first_non_zero_index
    input: input sequence
    output: index (integer) or indicator of none found
  - name: identify_last_non_zero_index
    input: input sequence
    output: index (integer) or indicator of none found
  - name: insert_zero
    target: input sequence
    position: immediately before the index identified by 'identify_first_non_zero_index'
  - name: remove_last_element
    target: modified sequence (after insertion)
    position: the final element
transformation_rule:
  condition: "If the input sequence contains at least one non-zero digit."
  steps:
    - Find the index of the first non-zero digit (`first_nz_idx`).
    - Insert a '0' into the sequence at `first_nz_idx`.
    - Remove the last element from the resulting sequence.
  fallback: "If the input sequence contains only zeros, return the input sequence unchanged."
invariants:
  - The length of the output sequence is the same as the length of the input sequence.
  - The relative order of digits within the identified 'sub-sequence' is preserved.
  - The relative order of leading zeros (before the first non-zero digit) is preserved.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Convert the sequence into a list of integers.
3.  Check if the sequence contains any non-zero digits.
    *   If the sequence contains only zeros, return the original sequence as a space-separated string.
    *   If the sequence contains non-zero digits, proceed to step 4.
4.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the list.
5.  Insert the integer `0` into the list at this found index.
6.  Remove the last element from the modified list.
7.  Convert the final list back into a sequence of space-separated digits (string).
8.  Return the resulting string.
