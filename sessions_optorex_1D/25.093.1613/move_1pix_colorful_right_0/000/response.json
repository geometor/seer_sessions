These sequences are represented as strings with space delimiters.\n*   **Properties:** Each sequence has a fixed length (12 in all examples). The digits within the sequence can be zero or non-zero. The position (index) of each digit is important. We can identify leading zeros, trailing zeros, and a \"core\" block of non-zero digits (potentially interspersed with zeros).\n*   **Actions:** The core action appears to be a positional shift or insertion/deletion operation based on the location of non-zero digits. Specifically, a '0' seems to be inserted, and an element seems to be removed to maintain the sequence length.\n*   **Relationships:** The output sequence is derived directly from the input sequence by rearranging elements based on the position of the first and last non-zero digits. The length of the sequence remains constant.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
