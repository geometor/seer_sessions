task_description: "Shift a sequence of digits by inserting a zero before the first non-zero digit and removing the last digit to maintain length."
elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - content: list of single integers (derived from space-separated string)
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - structure: ordered
  - type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 0-9 (represented as integers during processing)
      - significance: position of the first non-zero digit is key
actions:
  - name: parse_input
    input: space-separated string of digits
    output: list of integers
  - name: find_first_non_zero_index
    input: list of integers
    output: index (integer) or -1 if all zeros
  - name: insert_zero_at_index
    target: list of integers
    parameters: index (integer)
    effect: inserts the integer 0 at the specified index, shifting subsequent elements
  - name: remove_last_element
    target: list of integers
    effect: removes the element at the end of the list
  - name: format_output
    input: list of integers
    output: space-separated string of digits
transformation_rule:
  - Read the input string.
  - Convert the input string into a list of integers.
  - Find the index of the first element in the list that is not zero (`first_nz_idx`).
  - If no non-zero element is found (`first_nz_idx` is -1, meaning the list contains only zeros):
      - Convert the original list back to a space-separated string.
      - Return the resulting string.
  - If a non-zero element is found:
      - Create a mutable copy of the list (e.g., using `list(original_list)`).
      - Insert the integer `0` into the copied list at the `first_nz_idx`.
      - Remove the last element from the modified list.
      - Convert the modified list back into a space-separated string.
      - Return the resulting string.
invariants:
  - The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
  - The relative order of the digits from the input is preserved in the output, except for the inserted '0' and the removed last digit.
