            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified across all examples is a `TypeError` related to the input data format. The provided `transform` function expects a space-separated string as input (`input_str`) and uses the `.split()` method to parse it into a list of integers. However, the execution environment appears to be passing the input directly as a NumPy array, which does not have a `.split()` method.\n\nThe underlying transformation logic (shifting elements right, prepending a 0, and dropping the last element) deduced in the dreamer phase seems consistent with the input/output pairs. The strategy is to modify the code to accept the input as a NumPy array (or potentially a list of integers) directly, eliminating the need for string parsing.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nBased on the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`), the input type provided during execution is `numpy.ndarray`.\n\n*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray`\n*   **Input Element Type:** Integers (0-9)\n*   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 in all training examples.\n*   **Output Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` or `List[int]` based on the input type and transformation logic.\n*   **Output Length:** Consistently 12 in all training examples.\n*   **Transformation Success:** 0/7 training examples succeeded due to the input type mismatch. 0/1 test examples succeeded.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
