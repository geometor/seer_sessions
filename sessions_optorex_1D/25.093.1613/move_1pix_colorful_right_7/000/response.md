Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and structure my findings.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Data Format:** Both input and output are presented as sequences of single-digit integers separated by spaces. These can be interpreted as lists or arrays of integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** In all provided examples, the input sequence and the output sequence have the same length (12 elements).
3.  **Element Values:** The elements are digits from 0 to 9.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing each input to its corresponding output reveals a consistent pattern: the entire sequence of digits appears to be shifted one position to the right. The first element of the output sequence is always 0, and the last element of the input sequence seems to be dropped.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create a new sequence.
3.  Set the first element (index 0) of the new sequence to 0.
4.  Copy the elements from the input sequence, starting from the first element (index 0) up to, but not including, the last element, into the new sequence, starting from the second position (index 1).
5.  Return the new sequence as the output.
