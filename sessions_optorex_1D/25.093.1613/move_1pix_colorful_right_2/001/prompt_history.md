*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both lists of integers.
    *   The length of the input list and the output list is always the same (12 elements in all examples).
    *   The output list appears to be a modified version of the input list.
    *   Comparing input and output, the elements seem to be shifted one position to the right.
    *   The first element of the output list is always `0`.
    *   The last element of the input list seems to be discarded in the output list.
    *   The elements from the first position up to the second-to-last position of the input list appear in the output list, shifted one position to the right (from the second position to the last position).

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task: list_transformation
    objects:
      - name: input_list
        type: list
        contains: integers
        properties:
          length: 12 (constant across examples)
      - name: output_list
        type: list
        contains: integers
        properties:
          length: 12 (constant across examples)
    actions:
      - name: shift_right
        input: input_list
        output: intermediate_list (elements shifted one place right)
      - name: prepend_zero
        input: intermediate_list (elements from input[0] to input[length-2])
        output: output_list (a '0' is added at the beginning)
      - name: remove_last_element
        input: input_list
        result: elements used for shifting (input[0] to input[length-2])
    relationships:
      - type: derivation
        from: input_list
        to: output_list
        rule: The output_list is constructed by taking all elements of the input_list except the last one, shifting them one position to the right, and placing a '0' in the first position.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input list of integers.
    2.  Remove the last element from the input list.
    3.  Insert the integer `0` at the beginning of the modified list.
    4.  The resulting list is the output.
