"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of integers by finding the first non-zero element 
and the first zero element occurring at or after it. The identified zero 
element is moved to the position immediately before the first non-zero 
element. All elements originally between the first non-zero element and the 
moved zero are shifted one position to the right. If the array contains only 
zeros, it is returned unchanged.
