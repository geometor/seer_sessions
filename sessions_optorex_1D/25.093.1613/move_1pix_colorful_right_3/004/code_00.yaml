relationships:

    between: [element, data_row]
    description: Each element occupies a specific index within the data_row.
  - type: selection
    description: The core logic operates on the data_row extracted from the input_grid.
actions:
  - action: extract_data_row
    input: input_grid
    output: data_row (1D array)
    description: Select the first row (index 0) from the input_grid.
  - action: find_first_non_zero_in_row
    input: data_row
    output: index
    description: Locate the index of the first element in data_row that is not 0. Returns -1 if none found.
  - action: find_first_zero_in_row_from
    input:
      - data_row
      - start_index
    output: index
    description: Locate the index of the first 0 element in data_row at or after start_index. Returns -1 if none found.
  - action: assemble_new_row
    input:
      - original_data_row
      - first_nz_idx
      - target_zero_idx
    output: new_data_row (1D array)
    description: Concatenates slices of the original_data_row and the target zero element to form the transformed 1D sequence.
  - action: reshape_to_output_grid
    input: new_data_row (1D array)
    output: output_grid (2D array, shape 1x12)
    description: Reshapes the 1D result array into a 2D array with one row.
preconditions:
  - condition: Input is a 2D numpy array of shape (1, N).
  - condition: Elements are single digits (0-9).
edge_cases:
  - case: Input row contains only zeros.
    expected_behavior: Return the original input grid unchanged.
  - case: Input row contains non-zeros but no zeros at or after the first non-zero.
    expected_behavior: Return the original input grid unchanged (based on current logic, though examples don't show this).
