Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits, presented as space-separated strings. The length of the sequence appears constant (12 digits) across the examples.
*   **Digits:** The sequences contain digits from 0 to 9. The digit '0' seems to play a special role.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the digits. Specifically, a '0' digit appears to move leftwards in the sequence, causing a block of non-zero (and possibly some zero) digits to shift one position to the right.
*   **Key Positions:** The transformation seems dependent on the position of the *first non-zero* digit and the position of the *first zero digit* occurring at or after the first non-zero digit.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The execution results revealed a consistent `ValueError` across all examples, indicating a mismatch in NumPy array dimensions during concatenation. The error message "all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1 dimension(s)" points to the `input_grid` being a 2D array (inferred shape 1xN), while the previous code treated it as 1D. Slicing operations on the 2D `input_grid` produced 2D results, which could not be concatenated with the explicitly 1D array `np.array([0])`.

The core logic identified previously (find first non-zero, find first subsequent zero, move the zero left, shift the intermediate block right) appears correct based on the input/output pairs. The failure was purely in the implementation's handling of the data structure.

The strategy is to adapt the implementation:
1.  Acknowledge the input is a 2D NumPy array (shape 1xN).
2.  Extract the relevant sequence data from the first (and only) row, obtaining a 1D array.
3.  Apply the transformation logic to this 1D array.
4.  Construct the transformed 1D array.
5.  Reshape the final 1D array back into a 2D array (1xN) to match the expected output format.

**Metrics and Verification:**

The `tool_code` analysis confirmed:
*   The input array has `ndim=2` and `shape=(1, N)` (where N=12 in examples).
*   Extracting `input_grid[0]` gives a 1D array (`ndim=1`, `shape=(N,)`).
*   The helper functions (`_find_first_non_zero_index`, `_find_first_zero_index_from`) work correctly on the extracted 1D row.
*   Slicing the 1D row produces 1D arrays.
*   Concatenating these 1D slices with `np.array([0])` (also 1D) is valid and produces the correct 1D result matching the example outputs.

This confirms the transformation logic is sound, and the issue lies solely in adapting to the 2D input/output format of the execution environment.
