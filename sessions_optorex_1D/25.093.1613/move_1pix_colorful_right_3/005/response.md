"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array (represented as a 1xN 2D array) of integers by 
finding the first non-zero element and the first zero element occurring at or 
after it. The identified zero element is moved to the position immediately 
before the first non-zero element. All elements originally between the first 
non-zero element and the moved zero are shifted one position to the right. 
If the array contains only zeros, or if no zero is found after the first 
non-zero element, the original array is returned unchanged.
