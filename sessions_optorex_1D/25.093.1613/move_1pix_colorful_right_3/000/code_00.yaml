task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_digits
      - length: 12 (constant in examples)
    contains:
      - digit
  - object: digit
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - is_zero: boolean
      - position: index (0-based)
relationships:
  - type: positional
    between: [digit, sequence]
    description: Each digit occupies a specific index within the sequence.
  - type: identity
    description: Digits can be zero or non-zero.
actions:
  - action: find_first_non_zero
    input: sequence
    output: index
    description: Locate the index of the first digit in the sequence that is not '0'. Returns null or raises error if all are zero.
  - action: find_first_zero_after
    input: 
      - sequence
      - start_index 
    output: index
    description: Locate the index of the first '0' digit at or after the specified start_index. Returns null or raises error if no such zero exists.
  - action: move_element
    input:
      - sequence
      - source_index
      - destination_index
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Removes an element from the source_index and inserts it at the destination_index, shifting intermediate elements.
rule_components:
  - component: initial_zeros
    description: The sequence of zeros at the beginning of the input sequence.
  - component: target_zero
    description: The specific zero identified by find_first_zero_after.
  - component: shifted_block
    description: The block of digits starting from the first non-zero digit up to (but not including) the target_zero.
