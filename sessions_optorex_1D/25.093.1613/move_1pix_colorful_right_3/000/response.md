Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits, presented as space-separated strings. The length of the sequence appears constant (12 digits) across the examples.
*   **Digits:** The sequences contain digits from 0 to 9. The digit '0' seems to play a special role.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the digits. Specifically, a '0' digit appears to move leftwards in the sequence, causing a block of non-zero (and possibly some zero) digits to shift one position to the right.
*   **Key Positions:** The transformation seems dependent on the position of the *first non-zero* digit and the position of the *first zero digit* occurring at or after the first non-zero digit.

**YAML Facts:**

      - is_zero: boolean
      - position: index (0-based)
relationships:
  - type: positional
    between: [digit, sequence]
    description: Each digit occupies a specific index within the sequence.

actions:
  - action: find_first_non_zero
    input: sequence
    output: index
    description: Locate the index of the first digit in the sequence that is not '0'. Returns null or raises error if all are zero.
  - action: find_first_zero_after
    input: 
      - sequence
      - start_index 
    output: index
    description: Locate the index of the first '0' digit at or after the specified start_index. Returns null or raises error if no such zero exists.
  - action: move_element
    input:
      - sequence
      - source_index
      - destination_index
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Removes an element from the source_index and inserts it at the destination_index, shifting intermediate elements.
rule_components:
  - component: initial_zeros
    description: The sequence of zeros at the beginning of the input sequence.
  - component: target_zero
    description: The specific zero identified by find_first_zero_after.
  - component: shifted_block
    description: The block of digits starting from the first non-zero digit up to (but not including) the target_zero.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the sequence. If no non-zero digit exists (the sequence is all zeros), return the original sequence unchanged. Let this index be `first_nz_idx`.
3.  Find the index of the first zero digit that occurs at or after `first_nz_idx`. Let this index be `target_zero_idx`.
4.  Construct the output sequence by:
    a.  Taking all digits from the original sequence *before* `first_nz_idx`.
    b.  Appending the digit '0' (the one originally at `target_zero_idx`).
    c.  Appending all digits from the original sequence starting at `first_nz_idx` up to (but not including) `target_zero_idx`.
    d.  Appending all digits from the original sequence starting *after* `target_zero_idx` to the end of the sequence.
5.  Return the constructed output sequence.
