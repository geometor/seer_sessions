*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of integers into another sequence of the same length. By comparing the input and output sequences across the examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the elements of the input sequence appear to be shifted one position to the right in the output sequence. The first element of the output sequence is always '0', and the last element of the input sequence is effectively removed. The relative order of the other elements is preserved.

```yaml
    task_description: Shift a sequence of integers one position to the right, inserting a zero at the beginning.
    input_object:
      type: sequence
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - fixed_length
    output_object:
      type: sequence
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - fixed_length (same as input)
    transformation:
      action: right_shift
      details:
        - shift_amount: 1 position
        - element_inserted_at_start: 0
        - element_removed_at_end: last element of the input
      preserves:
        - relative order of shifted elements
        - sequence length
    examples:
      - input:  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0]
      - input:  [9, 8, 1, 2, 9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0]
        output: [0, 9, 8, 1, 2, 9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1, 0]

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
    2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length.
    3.  Set the first element (index 0) of the output sequence to 0.
    4.  Copy the elements from the input sequence, starting from the first element (index 0) up to, but not including, the last element, into the output sequence, starting from the second position (index 1).
