task_description: Shift a sequence of integers one position to the right, inserting a zero at the beginning and discarding the last element.
input_object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12
  attributes:
    - ordered
output_object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  length: 12 (same as input)
  attributes:
    - ordered
transformation:
  action: right_shift_and_pad
  parameters:
    shift_amount: 1
    padding_value: 0
    padding_position: start
    truncation: true
    truncation_position: end
    truncation_amount: 1
  description: Creates a new sequence where the first element is 0, followed by the first N-1 elements of the input sequence (where N is the input length). The last element of the input sequence is discarded. The length remains unchanged.
consistency_check:
  - rule: All examples follow the same right-shift pattern.
  - rule: Input and output lengths are consistently 12.
  - rule: The first element of the output is always 0.
execution_issue: The previous code implementation failed to correctly copy elements, resulting in an all-zero output. The logical description of the transformation remains valid.
