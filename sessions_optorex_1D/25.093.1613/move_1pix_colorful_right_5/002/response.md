**General Assessment:**

The previous execution failed because the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, while the testing environment provided a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch. The core transformation logic identified previously (shifting elements one position to the right, inserting a zero at the beginning, and discarding the last element) appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the understanding of the input and output data types. The `transform` function should expect a NumPy array as input and return a NumPy array as output. The parsing and formatting helper functions (`parse_input_string`, `format_output_list`) are unnecessary if the input/output are already arrays.

**Metrics:**

Based on the examples provided and the `tool_code` execution:

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers.
*   **Output Type:** NumPy array of integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** All provided examples have an input and output sequence length of 12. The transformation preserves the length.
*   **Transformation:** Right shift by 1 position. The element at index `i` in the input moves to index `i+1` in the output for `0 <= i < length-1`. The element at index `0` in the output is always 0. The last element of the input is discarded.

**Facts YAML:**


```yaml
task_description: Shift the elements of an integer NumPy array one position to the right, inserting a zero at the beginning and discarding the last element.
input_object:
  type: numpy.ndarray
  element_type: integer
  properties:
    - 1-dimensional
    - fixed_length (e.g., 12 in examples)
output_object:
  type: numpy.ndarray
  element_type: integer
  properties:
    - 1-dimensional
    - fixed_length (same as input)
transformation:
  action: right_shift_and_prepend_zero
  details:
    - shift_amount: 1 position
    - element_prepended: 0
    - element_removed: last element of the input array
  preserves:
    - relative order of shifted elements
    - array length
    - element data type (integer)
examples: # Representing as lists for clarity, assuming conversion to NumPy array
  - input:  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0]
  - input:  [9, 8, 1, 2, 9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1, 0, 0]
    output: [0, 9, 8, 1, 2, 9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1, 0]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept a 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers as input.
2.  Determine the length (`n`) of the input array.
3.  Create a new NumPy array of the same length (`n`) and data type (integers), initialized with zeros.
4.  Copy the elements from the input array, starting from the first element (index 0) up to, but not including, the last element (index `n-1`), into the new array, starting from the second position (index 1).
5.  Ensure the first element (index 0) of the new array is 0 (it will be if initialized with zeros, otherwise set it explicitly).
6.  Return the new NumPy array.
