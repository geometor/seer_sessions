"""
Transformation Rule:
Find the subsequence bounded by the first and last non-zero elements in the input sequence (list of integers). 
Shift this entire subsequence one position to the right within a new list of the same size, initialized with zeros. 
Elements before the subsequence's original start position are copied to the same positions in the new list.
Place a zero at the original starting position of the subsequence (this happens naturally if the first non-zero index > 0, or is achieved by the shift if first non-zero index is 0). 
Elements after the subsequence are effectively shifted or replaced by zeros to maintain the original sequence length. 
If the input sequence contains only zeros, return it unchanged (as a copy).
