            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core issue identified across all examples is a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that the input data, assumed by the previous code to be a `List[int]`, is being provided to the `transform` function (or its helper functions) as a NumPy array, likely a 2D array with shape (1, N). The comparison `if x != 0` inside the loops of `find_first_non_zero` and `find_last_non_zero` fails because `x` becomes the entire row (a 1D array) when iterating over a 2D array.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle potential NumPy array inputs. It should check the input type and dimensions. If it's a NumPy array, it should be converted or reshaped into a 1D structure (like selecting the first row if it's 2D) and then ideally converted to a standard Python list of integers before proceeding with the existing logic or passing it to helper functions. This aligns the actual data format with the format expected by the core algorithm and helper functions.\n2.  **Helper Functions:** Ensure the helper functions (`find_first_non_zero`, `find_last_non_zero`) receive and operate on a 1D sequence (list or 1D array) where element-wise comparison `x != 0` is valid.\n3.  **Algorithm Validation:** Once the input type issue is resolved, the core logic (finding bounds, shifting the subsequence) can be properly tested against the examples. The fundamental transformation rule described previously appears correct and consistent with the examples, pending correction of the type handling error.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe simulation performed previously confirms the likely cause:\n\n"
