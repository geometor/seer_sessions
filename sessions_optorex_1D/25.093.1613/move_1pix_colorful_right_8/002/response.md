## General Assessment

The primary issue identified is a type mismatch error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, while the testing environment provided a NumPy array. The core logic of identifying the non-zero subsequence and shifting it right appears correct based on the examples, but it couldn't be executed due to this input type incompatibility.

The strategy for resolution is straightforward:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).
2.  Ensure the output is returned in the expected format (likely a list or NumPy array, matching the input type). The conversion back to a string (`" ".join(map(str, output_list))`) should also be removed or adjusted based on the required output format.

## Metrics

Since the code failed before executing the core logic due to the type error, detailed execution metrics cannot be gathered from the failed run. However, analyzing the examples visually confirms the underlying pattern:

| Example   | Input Sequence                               | First Non-Zero Index | Last Non-Zero Index | Subsequence (Input Indices) | Expected Output Sequence                         |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| train\_1  | `[0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`     | 1                    | 2                   | `[3, 4]` (1-2)              | `[0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`         |
| train\_2  | `[0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`     | 3                    | 7                   | `[4, 1, 1, 2, 6]` (3-7)     | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0]`         |
| train\_3  | `[8, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`     | 0                    | 3                   | `[8, 1, 2, 1]` (0-3)        | `[0, 8, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`         |
| train\_4  | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0]`     | 6                    | 8                   | `[5, 9, 6]` (6-8)           | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 6, 0, 0]`         |
| train\_5  | `[0, 2, 5, 2, 8, 7, 1, 7, 9, 6, 1, 0]`     | 1                    | 10                  | `[2..1]` (1-10)             | `[0, 0, 2, 5, 2, 8, 7, 1, 7, 9, 6, 1]`         |
| train\_6  | `[0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0]`     | 3                    | 9                   | `[4..7]` (3-9)              | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 6, 8, 4, 5, 7, 0]`         |
| train\_7  | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]`     | 5                    | 7                   | `[5, 5, 9]` (5-7)           | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0]`         |
| All Zeros | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`     | -1                   | -1                  | N/A                         | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`         |

The pattern holds consistently: find the block from the first non-zero to the last non-zero element (inclusive), shift this block one position right, and fill the original first position of the block with a zero.

## Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - item: input_sequence
    type: list  # Changed from string based on error
    subtype: integer
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: output_sequence
    type: list # Changed from string based on error
    subtype: integer
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: active_subsequence
    type: sublist
    derivation: determined by the span from the first non-zero element to the last non-zero element in the input_sequence.
    properties:
      - includes all elements within its start and end indices, including any zeros.
      - If the input_sequence contains only zeros, this subsequence is considered empty or non-existent.
relationships:
  - input_sequence contains the active_subsequence.
  - output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by shifting the active_subsequence.
actions:
  - identify: find the start index (`first_nz`) and end index (`last_nz`) of the active_subsequence in the input_sequence.
  - check_existence: determine if an active_subsequence exists (i.e., `first_nz` is not -1).
  - create_output: initialize a new list of the same size as the input_sequence, typically filled with zeros.
  - copy_prefix: copy elements from the input_sequence before `first_nz` to the output_sequence at the same indices.
  - shift_subsequence: copy elements from the input_sequence from `first_nz` to `last_nz` into the output_sequence, starting at index `first_nz + 1` and ensuring not to exceed list bounds.
  - preserve_unchanged: if no active_subsequence exists, the output_sequence is identical to the input_sequence.
transformation:
  - condition: If an active_subsequence exists (`first_nz != -1`).
    steps:
      - Locate the index of the first non-zero element (`first_nz`).
      - Locate the index of the last non-zero element (`last_nz`).
      - Create an output list (`output_sequence`) of the same length as the input, initialized with zeros.
      - Copy elements from `input_sequence[0]` up to `input_sequence[first_nz - 1]` to `output_sequence` at the same indices (indices 0 to `first_nz - 1`).
      - Copy elements from `input_sequence[first_nz]` up to `input_sequence[last_nz]` to `output_sequence`, starting at index `first_nz + 1` and ending at index `last_nz + 1`. Handle boundary conditions (do not write past the end of `output_sequence`).
  - condition: If no active_subsequence exists (`first_nz == -1`).
    steps:
      - The output_sequence is a copy of the input_sequence.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence (as a list or array of integers).
2.  Determine the length (`n`) of the input sequence.
3.  Find the index of the first non-zero number (`first_nz`). If no non-zero numbers exist, set `first_nz` to -1.
4.  If `first_nz` is -1 (the sequence is all zeros), return a copy of the input sequence.
5.  Otherwise (if non-zero elements exist):
    a.  Find the index of the last non-zero number (`last_nz`).
    b.  Create a new output sequence of length `n`, initialized with zeros.
    c.  Copy the elements from the input sequence from index 0 up to (but not including) `first_nz` into the output sequence at the same positions (indices 0 to `first_nz - 1`).
    d.  Iterate from index `i = first_nz` up to `last_nz` (inclusive):
        i.  Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_index = i + 1`.
        ii. If `target_index` is less than `n` (within the bounds of the output sequence), copy the element `input_sequence[i]` to `output_sequence[target_index]`.
    e. Return the newly constructed output sequence.
