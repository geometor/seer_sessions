"""
Transformation Rule:
Given an input sequence (potentially as a list, string, or NumPy array), first ensure it is represented as a 1D Python list of integers. 
Find the subsequence bounded by the first and last non-zero elements in this 1D list. 
Shift this entire subsequence one position to the right within a new list of the same size, initialized with zeros. 
Elements before the subsequence's original start position are copied to the same positions in the new list.
Elements after the subsequence are effectively shifted or replaced by zeros to maintain the original sequence length. 
If the input sequence contains only zeros, return it unchanged (as a copy of the processed 1D list).
