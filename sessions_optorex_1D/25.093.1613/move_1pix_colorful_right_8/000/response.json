The transformation involves shifting a specific sub-sequence within the list one position to the right.\n\n1.  **Identify Key Elements:** The core elements are the sequence itself and a sub-sequence within it. This sub-sequence appears to be defined by the positions of the first and last non-zero numbers. Zeros within this sub-sequence are treated as part of the sub-sequence.\n2.  **Identify the Action:** The primary action is a 'shift right' operation applied to the identified sub-sequence.\n3.  **Identify Invariants:** The length of the sequence remains constant. The relative order and values of the elements *within* the shifted sub-sequence are preserved. Elements *before* the sub-sequence also remain in their original positions.\n4.  **Identify Changes:** The sub-sequence moves one position to the right. The position immediately preceding the original start of the sub-sequence becomes 0. Elements originally after the sub-sequence might be overwritten or effectively dropped if the shift extends to the end of the list's bounds.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
