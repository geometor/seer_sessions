task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    type: list
    subtype: integer
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: active_subsequence
    type: sublist
    derivation: determined by the span from the first non-zero element to the last non-zero element in the input sequence.
    properties:
      - includes all elements within its start and end indices, including any zeros.
      - If the input sequence contains only zeros, this subsequence is considered empty or non-existent.
relationships:
  - input sequence contains the active_subsequence.
  - output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
actions:
  - identify: find the start and end indices of the active_subsequence in the input.
  - shift: move the active_subsequence one position to the right.
  - insert: place a zero at the original starting position of the active_subsequence.
  - preserve: maintain the original elements located before the active_subsequence.
  - maintain_length: ensure the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence (elements shifted beyond the original boundary are implicitly dropped).
transformation:
  - condition: If an active_subsequence exists (i.e., at least one non-zero element is present).
    steps:
      - Locate the index of the first non-zero element (`start_index`).
      - Locate the index of the last non-zero element (`end_index`).
      - Construct the output sequence by:
        - Copying elements from index 0 to `start_index - 1` from the input to the output at the same indices.
        - Placing a 0 at `start_index` in the output.
        - Copying elements from `start_index` to `end_index` from the input to the output, starting at index `start_index + 1` and ending at `end_index + 1`.
        - Filling any remaining positions in the output (after `end_index + 1`) with zeros, up to the original sequence length.
  - condition: If no active_subsequence exists (input is all zeros).
    steps:
      - The output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
