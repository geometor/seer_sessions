## Perception

The input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers, always of the same length (12 in the examples). The transformation involves shifting a specific sub-sequence within the list one position to the right.

1.  **Identify Key Elements:** The core elements are the sequence itself and a sub-sequence within it. This sub-sequence appears to be defined by the positions of the first and last non-zero numbers. Zeros within this sub-sequence are treated as part of the sub-sequence.
2.  **Identify the Action:** The primary action is a 'shift right' operation applied to the identified sub-sequence.
3.  **Identify Invariants:** The length of the sequence remains constant. The relative order and values of the elements *within* the shifted sub-sequence are preserved. Elements *before* the sub-sequence also remain in their original positions.
4.  **Identify Changes:** The sub-sequence moves one position to the right. The position immediately preceding the original start of the sub-sequence becomes 0. Elements originally after the sub-sequence might be overwritten or effectively dropped if the shift extends to the end of the list's bounds.

task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    type: list
    subtype: integer
    properties:
      - length: fixed (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - item: active_subsequence
    type: sublist
    derivation: determined by the span from the first non-zero element to the last non-zero element in the input sequence.
    properties:
      - includes all elements within its start and end indices, including any zeros.
      - If the input sequence contains only zeros, this subsequence is considered empty or non-existent.
relationships:
  - input sequence contains the active_subsequence.
  - output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
actions:
  - identify: find the start and end indices of the active_subsequence in the input.
  - shift: move the active_subsequence one position to the right.
  - insert: place a zero at the original starting position of the active_subsequence.
  - preserve: maintain the original elements located before the active_subsequence.
  - maintain_length: ensure the output sequence has the same length as the input sequence (elements shifted beyond the original boundary are implicitly dropped).
transformation:
  - condition: If an active_subsequence exists (i.e., at least one non-zero element is present).
    steps:
      - Locate the index of the first non-zero element (`start_index`).
      - Locate the index of the last non-zero element (`end_index`).
      - Construct the output sequence by:
        - Copying elements from index 0 to `start_index - 1` from the input to the output at the same indices.
        - Placing a 0 at `start_index` in the output.
        - Copying elements from `start_index` to `end_index` from the input to the output, starting at index `start_index + 1` and ending at `end_index + 1`.
        - Filling any remaining positions in the output (after `end_index + 1`) with zeros, up to the original sequence length.
  - condition: If no active_subsequence exists (input is all zeros).
    steps:
      - The output sequence is identical to the input sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero number (`first_nz`).
3.  Find the index of the last non-zero number (`last_nz`).
4.  If no non-zero numbers are found (the sequence is all zeros), the output is identical to the input.
5.  Otherwise:
    a.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros.
    b.  Copy the elements from the input sequence from index 0 up to (but not including) `first_nz` into the output sequence at the same positions.
    c.  Copy the elements from the input sequence starting at index `first_nz` up to and including index `last_nz` into the output sequence, starting at index `first_nz + 1` and ending at index `last_nz + 1`.
6.  Return the newly constructed output sequence.

## General Assessment

The primary issue identified is a type mismatch error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, while the testing environment provided a NumPy array. The core logic of identifying the non-zero subsequence and shifting it right appears correct based on the examples, but it couldn't be executed due to this input type incompatibility.

The strategy for resolution is straightforward:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).
2.  Ensure the output is returned in the expected format (likely a list or NumPy array, matching the input type). The conversion back to a string (`" ".join(map(str, output_list))`) should also be removed or adjusted based on the required output format.

## Metrics

Since the code failed before executing the core logic due to the type error, detailed execution metrics cannot be gathered from the failed run. However, analyzing the examples visually confirms the underlying pattern:

| Example   | Input Sequence                               | First Non-Zero Index | Last Non-Zero Index | Subsequence (Input Indices) | Expected Output Sequence                         |

The pattern holds consistently: find the block from the first non-zero to the last non-zero element (inclusive), shift this block one position right, and fill the original first position of the block with a zero.
