objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: numpy array of integers (digits 0-9)
      - ordered
      - fixed_length: True # Length remains constant between input and output
actions:
  - name: find_first_non_zero_index
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - index: Position (integer index) of the first digit > 0. Returns -1 or indicates none found if all are zero.
  - name: shift_sub_array_right
    inputs:
      - sequence
      - start_index: The index found by find_first_non_zero_index
    outputs:
      - modified_sequence: A new sequence where elements from start_index to the second-to-last element are moved one position right, the element at start_index becomes 0, and elements before start_index remain unchanged. The last element is discarded.
  - name: handle_all_zeros
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - unmodified_sequence: If find_first_non_zero_index indicates no non-zero elements, the sequence is returned as is.
relationships:
  - The core transformation depends on the index of the first non-zero element.
  - If a non-zero element exists at index `i`:
    - The output sequence retains elements from index 0 to `i-1` of the input sequence.
    - The output sequence element at index `i` is 0.
    - The output sequence elements from index `i+1` to the end are the input sequence elements from index `i` to the second-to-last element.
  - If no non-zero element exists, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
