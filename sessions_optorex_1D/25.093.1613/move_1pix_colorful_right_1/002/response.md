*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The previous attempt failed because it incorrectly assumed the input was a string (`str`) and tried to use string methods (`.split()`) on what was actually a NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`).
    *   The core transformation logic (find first non-zero, insert 0, truncate) appears correct based on manually checking the input/output pairs provided in the examples.
    *   The strategy is to correct the input handling: accept a NumPy array, convert it to a list for easier manipulation (insertion), perform the transformation steps, and then format the output as a space-separated string as shown in the examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers (based on error message `numpy.ndarray object has no attribute 'split'`).
    *   **Output Type:** Space-separated string of digits (based on example outputs).
    *   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all training examples.
    *   **Output Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all training examples (equal to input length).
    *   **Algorithm Consistency:** The rule "Insert 0 before the first non-zero element and truncate to original length" consistently matches all provided input/output pairs.
        *   Example 1: First non-zero '9' at index 1. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 9, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 2: First non-zero '8' at index 0. Insert '0' -> `[0, 8, 7, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 3: First non-zero '2' at index 6. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 4: First non-zero '4' at index 4. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 5: First non-zero '2' at index 4. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 6: First non-zero '5' at index 1. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 5, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 7: First non-zero '7' at index 0. Insert '0' -> `[0, 7, 9, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
    *   **Edge Case:** The case where all inputs are zero (e.g., `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`) was not explicitly provided, but the `find_first_non_zero_index` function correctly defaults to index 0 in this scenario. Inserting '0' at index 0 and truncating would result in the same sequence of zeros, which seems logical.

    relationships:
      - The output_sequence (string) is derived from the input_sequence (numpy.ndarray) through a series of actions: type conversion, finding an index, inserting a digit, truncating, and formatting.
      - The number of digits in the output_sequence is constrained to be equal to the number of elements in the input_sequence.
      - The insertion_index is determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the input_sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence as a NumPy array of integers. Record its length (number of elements), N.
    2.  Convert the input NumPy array into a Python list of integers.
    3.  Iterate through the list from the beginning (index 0) to find the index of the first integer that is not equal to 0. Let this index be `insertion_index`. If no non-zero integer is found, set `insertion_index` to 0.
    4.  Create a new list by inserting the integer 0 into the list (from step 2) at the `insertion_index`.
    5.  Take the first N elements from the list created in step 4.
    6.  Convert this final list of N integers into a single string where each integer is separated by a space. This string is the output.
