*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of single digits, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   All provided examples have an input sequence length of 12 and an output sequence length of 12.
    *   The output sequence appears to be derived from the input sequence by inserting a '0' at a specific position and then potentially truncating the result to maintain the original length.
    *   The position of the inserted '0' seems related to the position of the first non-zero digit in the input sequence.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences reveals that the relative order of the original digits is preserved in the output, but shifted to the right starting from the insertion point. The last element of the sequence after insertion is effectively dropped to maintain the original length.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of digits. Record its length.
    2.  Iterate through the input sequence from the beginning (index 0) to find the index of the first digit that is not '0'. Let this index be `insertion_index`.
    3.  Create a new sequence by inserting the digit '0' into the input sequence at the `insertion_index`.
    4.  Take the first N elements from the sequence created in step 3, where N is the original length of the input sequence recorded in step 1. This resulting sequence is the output.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    *   The previous attempt failed because it incorrectly assumed the input was a string (`str`) and tried to use string methods (`.split()`) on what was actually a NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`).
    *   The core transformation logic (find first non-zero, insert 0, truncate) appears correct based on manually checking the input/output pairs provided in the examples.
    *   The strategy is to correct the input handling: accept a NumPy array, convert it to a list for easier manipulation (insertion), perform the transformation steps, and then format the output as a space-separated string as shown in the examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers (based on error message `numpy.ndarray object has no attribute 'split'`).
    *   **Output Type:** Space-separated string of digits (based on example outputs).
    *   **Input Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all training examples.
    *   **Output Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all training examples (equal to input length).
    *   **Algorithm Consistency:** The rule "Insert 0 before the first non-zero element and truncate to original length" consistently matches all provided input/output pairs.
        *   Example 1: First non-zero '9' at index 1. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 9, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 2: First non-zero '8' at index 0. Insert '0' -> `[0, 8, 7, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 3: First non-zero '2' at index 6. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 4: First non-zero '4' at index 4. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 5: First non-zero '2' at index 4. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 6: First non-zero '5' at index 1. Insert '0' -> `[0, 0, 5, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
        *   Example 7: First non-zero '7' at index 0. Insert '0' -> `[0, 7, 9, ...]`. Truncate. Matches.
    *   **Edge Case:** The case where all inputs are zero (e.g., `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`) was not explicitly provided, but the `find_first_non_zero_index` function correctly defaults to index 0 in this scenario. Inserting '0' at index 0 and truncating would result in the same sequence of zeros, which seems logical.
