task_elements:
  - element: sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D list of integers
      - length: 12 (observed in examples)
      - contains_pivot: true
  - element: digit_0
    properties:
      - role: background/empty_space
      - condition_for_shift: must be adjacent to a block on the side away from the pivot
      - role_in_shift: gets replaced by the block's digit
  - element: digit_2
    properties:
      - role: pivot/reference_point
      - cardinality: exactly one per sequence
      - position: determines shift direction and eligibility
      - state: remains unchanged in position and value
  - element: non_zero_digit_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits (excluding '2')
      - cardinality: exactly one per sequence (observed in examples)
      - can_be_subject_to_action: true
      - state: can shift position by one cell
actions:
  - action: shift_block_towards_pivot
    properties:
      - target: the single non_zero_digit_block
      - direction: one step towards the pivot ('2')
      - magnitude: one cell
      - condition: block must be adjacent to a '0' on the side opposite the pivot ('2')
      - effect_on_block: moves one position towards pivot
      - effect_on_adjacent_0: the adjacent '0' (that triggered the shift) is replaced by the digit from the moving block
      - effect_on_trailing_edge: the cell at the original trailing edge of the block (leftmost cell for right shift, rightmost cell for left shift) becomes '0'
      - cardinality: occurs at most once (either shifts or doesn't)
relationships:
  - relationship: position_relative_to_pivot
    between: [non_zero_digit_block, digit_2]
    properties:
      - determines the side (left/right) of the block relative to the pivot
      - determines which adjacent cell ('0' before or '0' after) enables the shift
  - relationship: adjacency
    between: [non_zero_digit_block, digit_0]
    properties:
      - required condition for shift (must be on the side opposite the pivot)
invariants:
  - The position and value of the digit '2' remain constant.
  - The length of the sequence remains constant.
  - Digits not part of the shifted block and not the '0' involved in the swap remain in their original positions.
  - Only one block exists, and only that block can potentially shift.
  - The digit value within the block remains constant.
