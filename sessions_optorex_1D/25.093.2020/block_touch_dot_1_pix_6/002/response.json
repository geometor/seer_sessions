            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe core issue identified is an input type mismatch. The provided `transform` function expects a string input (due to `input_str.split()`) but received a NumPy array during testing, causing the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples. The underlying transformation logic, however, appears consistent with the examples when checked manually against the hypothesis.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Modify Input Handling:** Adjust the `transform` function to accept a list of integers directly, removing the `parse_input` call from within it. The expectation will be that the input is already parsed into a list before being passed to `transform`. The `format_output` function is also unnecessary if the function is expected to return a list. We will assume the function should now take a list and return a list.\n2.  **Validate Logic:** Confirm the block identification and shifting logic remains correct based on the manual analysis and metrics gathered.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the list input/output and solidify the understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on manual analysis and the code execution to gather structural information:\n\n"
