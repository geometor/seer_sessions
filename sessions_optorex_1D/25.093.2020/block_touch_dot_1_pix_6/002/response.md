## General Assessment and Strategy

The core issue identified is an input type mismatch. The provided `transform` function expects a string input (due to `input_str.split()`) but received a NumPy array during testing, causing the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples. The underlying transformation logic, however, appears consistent with the examples when checked manually against the hypothesis.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Modify Input Handling:** Adjust the `transform` function to accept a list of integers directly, removing the `parse_input` call from within it. The expectation will be that the input is already parsed into a list before being passed to `transform`. The `format_output` function is also unnecessary if the function is expected to return a list. We will assume the function should now take a list and return a list.
2.  **Validate Logic:** Confirm the block identification and shifting logic remains correct based on the manual analysis and metrics gathered.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the list input/output and solidify the understanding of the transformation rule.

## Metrics

Based on manual analysis and the code execution to gather structural information:


```
[
    {'example': 1, 'length': 12, 'pivot_index': 4, 'num_blocks': 1, 'blocks': [{'start': 7, 'end': 11, 'digit': 5}], 'shifted': True},
    {'example': 2, 'length': 12, 'pivot_index': 5, 'num_blocks': 1, 'blocks': [{'start': 1, 'end': 4, 'digit': 7}], 'shifted': False},
    {'example': 3, 'length': 12, 'pivot_index': 0, 'num_blocks': 1, 'blocks': [{'start': 1, 'end': 4, 'digit': 8}], 'shifted': False},
    {'example': 4, 'length': 12, 'pivot_index': 2, 'num_blocks': 1, 'blocks': [{'start': 5, 'end': 7, 'digit': 5}], 'shifted': True},
    {'example': 5, 'length': 12, 'pivot_index': 6, 'num_blocks': 1, 'blocks': [{'start': 1, 'end': 2, 'digit': 8}], 'shifted': True},
    {'example': 6, 'length': 12, 'pivot_index': 10, 'num_blocks': 1, 'blocks': [{'start': 0, 'end': 9, 'digit': 9}], 'shifted': False},
    {'example': 7, 'length': 12, 'pivot_index': 1, 'num_blocks': 1, 'blocks': [{'start': 6, 'end': 10, 'digit': 6}], 'shifted': True}
]
```


**Observations from Metrics:**

*   All inputs are lists of length 12.
*   A single pivot digit '2' exists in every input.
*   A single contiguous block of identical non-zero, non-pivot digits exists in every input.
*   A shift occurs if and only if the block is adjacent to a '0' on the side *away* from the pivot '2'.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D list of integers
      - length: 12 (observed in examples)
      - contains_pivot: true
  - element: digit_0
    properties:
      - role: background/empty_space
      - condition_for_shift: must be adjacent to a block on the side away from the pivot
      - role_in_shift: gets replaced by the block's digit
  - element: digit_2
    properties:
      - role: pivot/reference_point
      - cardinality: exactly one per sequence
      - position: determines shift direction and eligibility
      - state: remains unchanged in position and value
  - element: non_zero_digit_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits (excluding '2')
      - cardinality: exactly one per sequence (observed in examples)
      - can_be_subject_to_action: true
      - state: can shift position by one cell
actions:
  - action: shift_block_towards_pivot
    properties:
      - target: the single non_zero_digit_block
      - direction: one step towards the pivot ('2')
      - magnitude: one cell
      - condition: block must be adjacent to a '0' on the side opposite the pivot ('2')
      - effect_on_block: moves one position towards pivot
      - effect_on_adjacent_0: the adjacent '0' (that triggered the shift) is replaced by the digit from the moving block
      - effect_on_trailing_edge: the cell at the original trailing edge of the block (leftmost cell for right shift, rightmost cell for left shift) becomes '0'
      - cardinality: occurs at most once (either shifts or doesn't)
relationships:
  - relationship: position_relative_to_pivot
    between: [non_zero_digit_block, digit_2]
    properties:
      - determines the side (left/right) of the block relative to the pivot
      - determines which adjacent cell ('0' before or '0' after) enables the shift
  - relationship: adjacency
    between: [non_zero_digit_block, digit_0]
    properties:
      - required condition for shift (must be on the side opposite the pivot)
invariants:
  - The position and value of the digit '2' remain constant.
  - The length of the sequence remains constant.
  - Digits not part of the shifted block and not the '0' involved in the swap remain in their original positions.
  - Only one block exists, and only that block can potentially shift.
  - The digit value within the block remains constant.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a list of integers.
2.  Create a copy of the input list to serve as the potential output list.
3.  Identify the index (position) of the unique digit '2' (the pivot) in the list. If '2' is not found, return the original list.
4.  Scan the list to find the start index, end index, and digit value of the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (that are not '2').
5.  If no such block is found, return the original list.
6.  Determine if the found block is located to the left or right of the pivot index.
7.  **If the block is to the right of the pivot:**
    a.  Check if the index immediately before the block's start index is valid (i.e., >= 0) and if the value at that index in the list is '0'.
    b.  If both conditions are true, modify the copied output list: change the value at the index *before* the block's start to the block's digit, and change the value at the block's original *end* index to '0'. This performs a leftward shift.
8.  **If the block is to the left of the pivot:**
    a.  Check if the index immediately after the block's end index is valid (i.e., < list length) and if the value at that index in the list is '0'.
    b.  If both conditions are true, modify the copied output list: change the value at the index *after* the block's end to the block's digit, and change the value at the block's original *start* index to '0'. This performs a rightward shift.
9.  If neither of the shift conditions (in step 7 or 8) was met, the copied output list remains unchanged from the original input.
10. Return the (potentially modified) output list.
