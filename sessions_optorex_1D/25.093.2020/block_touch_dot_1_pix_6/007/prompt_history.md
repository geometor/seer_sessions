*   **Perception of Elements:** The input and output are 1D sequences (arrays) of single digits. The digit '0' appears frequently and seems to represent empty space or background. The digit '2' appears exactly once in each sequence and acts as a reference point or pivot. Other non-zero digits ('5', '6', '7', '8', '9') form contiguous blocks. The transformation involves the potential movement (shifting) of one such block relative to the '2'.

      - element: digit_0
        properties:
          - role: background/empty_space

          - condition: block must be adjacent to a '0' on the side away from the pivot
          - effect_on_block: moves one position towards pivot
          - effect_on_adjacent_0: replaced by the digit from the moving block
          - effect_on_original_end_of_block: the cell at the original trailing edge (leftmost for right shift, rightmost for left shift) becomes '0'
          - cardinality: at most one shift per transformation
    relationships:
      - relationship: position_relative_to_pivot
        between: [non_zero_digit_block, digit_2]
        properties:
          - determines if a potential shift is leftward or rightward
      - relationship: adjacency
        between: [non_zero_digit_block, digit_0]
        properties:
          - required condition for shift (on the side opposite the pivot)
    invariants:
      - The digit '2' remains in its original position.
      - Digits not part of the shifted block and not the replaced '0' remain in their original positions.
      - The length of the sequence remains constant.
      - Only one block shifts per transformation.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the position of the unique digit '2' in the input sequence.
    2.  Scan the sequence to find all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
    3.  For each block found:
        a.  Determine if the block is located entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the '2'.
        b.  **If the block is to the right of '2':** Check if the cell immediately preceding the block contains a '0'. If it does, this block is the target for shifting.
        c.  **If the block is to the left of '2':** Check if the cell immediately following the block contains a '0'. If it does, this block is the target for shifting.
    4.  If a target block for shifting was identified:
        a.  **If the target block was to the right of '2' (and preceded by '0'):** Create the output sequence by copying the input, then change the '0' immediately before the block to the digit of the block, and change the last digit of the original block position to '0'.
        b.  **If the target block was to the left of '2' (and followed by '0'):** Create the output sequence by copying the input, then change the '0' immediately after the block to the digit of the block, and change the first digit of the original block position to '0'.
    5.  If no target block for shifting was identified (either no blocks exist, or none meet the adjacency-to-'0' condition), the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided Python code (`code_00.py`) attempts to implement the transformation rule observed in the initial examples. The core logic involves identifying a pivot ('2'), a single contiguous block of non-zero/non-pivot digits, and shifting this block one step towards the pivot *if* there is a '0' adjacent to the block on the side opposite the pivot.

However, the execution results show that the code fails on examples `train_1`, `train_4`, `train_5`, and `train_7`. In all these failing cases, the expected output involves a shift of the block, but the code's output is identical to the input, indicating the shift was not performed. Conversely, the code succeeds on examples where no shift is expected (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_6`, `test_1`).

This pattern strongly suggests that the code correctly identifies situations where *no* shift should occur, but fails to execute the shift when the conditions *are* met according to the rule derived from the input/output pairs. The conditions for the shift (block exists, pivot exists, '0' is adjacent on the side away from the pivot) seem correctly identified in the natural language program and appear to be checked in the code's conditional statements.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Conditions:** Programmatically analyze each training example to confirm the presence of the pivot, the block, its position relative to the pivot, and the value of the crucial adjacent cell ('0' on the side away from the pivot). This will confirm if the conditions for the shift were indeed met in the failing examples.
2.  **Refine Rule Description:** Assuming the execution results point to a flaw in the previous code's implementation rather than a misunderstanding of the rule itself (since the rule derived matches the *expected* outputs), refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be maximally clear about the conditions and the shift mechanism. Focus on the precise conditions triggering the shift. The goal is to describe the transformation visible in the *data*, even if the provided code failed to replicate it.

**Metrics Analysis:**

The code execution confirms that for all examples where the code failed (`train_1`, `train_4`, `train_5`, `train_7`), the condition for the shift *was* indeed met in the input data:
*   A pivot '2' was present.
*   A single contiguous block of non-zero, non-'2' digits was present.
*   A '0' was present in the cell adjacent to the block on the side away from the pivot.

Furthermore, the analysis confirms that in these exact cases, a shift *did* occur when comparing the input to the expected output (`Shift Occurred (Output vs Input): True`). The cases where the code succeeded (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_6`) were correctly identified as not meeting the shift condition, and no shift occurred in the expected output.

This confirms the initial hypothesis: the transformation rule involves shifting the block towards the pivot if and only if the specific '0' adjacency condition is met. The previous code failed to *execute* this shift correctly, despite apparently checking the right conditions. The natural language program should describe the rule as observed in the input/output data.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - element: sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D array of single digits
      - contains_pivot: yes, the digit '2'
      - contains_blocks: potentially one contiguous block of identical digits (not '0' or '2')
      - length_invariant: true
  - element: digit_0
    properties:
      - role: background / empty space
      - trigger_for_shift: if located adjacent to the block on the side away from the pivot
  - element: digit_2
    properties:
      - role: pivot / reference point
      - cardinality: exactly one per sequence
      - position_invariant: true
      - determines_shift_direction: yes (block moves towards pivot)
  - element: non_zero_non_pivot_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of identical digits (e.g., 5 5 5, 8 8)
      - condition: digits are not '0' and not '2'
      - cardinality: at most one such block per sequence (based on examples)
      - action_subject: can be shifted if conditions met

actions:
  - action: shift_block_towards_pivot
    properties:
      - target: non_zero_non_pivot_block
      - condition: must be adjacent to a '0' on the side facing away from the pivot '2'
      - direction: one step towards the pivot '2'
      - mechanism:
          - The adjacent '0' (trigger) is replaced by the block's digit.
          - The cell at the original trailing edge of the block becomes '0'.
            - Trailing edge = rightmost cell of the block if shift is leftward.
            - Trailing edge = leftmost cell of the block if shift is rightward.
      - cardinality: occurs at most once if conditions are met; otherwise, no change.

relationships:
  - relationship: block_position_relative_to_pivot
    between: [non_zero_non_pivot_block, digit_2]
    properties:
      - determines which side is "away" from the pivot for the adjacency check
      - determines shift direction (leftward if block is right of pivot, rightward if block is left of pivot)
  - relationship: adjacency_for_shift
    between: [non_zero_non_pivot_block, digit_0]
    properties:
      - location: must be the cell immediately adjacent to the block on the side opposite the pivot.
      - required: this specific adjacency to '0' is necessary to trigger the shift.

invariants:
  - Position of the pivot '2'.
  - Digits not part of the block and not the '0' involved in the shift.
  - Length of the sequence.
  - Identity (digit value) of the block being shifted.
  - Only one block exists and potentially shifts.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify Pivot:** Find the index (position) of the unique digit '2' in the input sequence. If no '2' is found, the sequence remains unchanged.
2.  **Identify Block:** Scan the sequence to find the single contiguous block of identical digits that are neither '0' nor '2'. If no such block is found, the sequence remains unchanged. Note the block's starting index, ending index, and digit value.
3.  **Check Shift Condition:**
    a.  Determine if the block is located entirely to the left (`end_index < pivot_index`) or entirely to the right (`start_index > pivot_index`) of the pivot.
    b.  **If the block is to the right of the pivot:** Check if the cell immediately to the *left* of the block (`index = start_index - 1`) exists and contains a '0'.
    c.  **If the block is to the left of the pivot:** Check if the cell immediately to the *right* of the block (`index = end_index + 1`) exists and contains a '0'.
4.  **Perform Transformation (if condition met):**
    a.  If the condition in step 3b or 3c is met (a '0' is adjacent on the side away from the pivot), create the output sequence by modifying a copy of the input sequence:
        i.  **If shifting left (block was right):** Change the value at `start_index - 1` to the block's digit. Change the value at the block's original `end_index` to '0'.
        ii. **If shifting right (block was left):** Change the value at `end_index + 1` to the block's digit. Change the value at the block's original `start_index` to '0'.
5.  **No Transformation (if condition not met):** If the condition in step 3b or 3c is *not* met, the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
6.  **Return Output:** Return the resulting sequence.
