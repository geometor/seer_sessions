"""
Transforms a 1D sequence (represented as a list or NumPy array of integers) based on a pivot '2'. 
It identifies the unique pivot digit '2' and the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits 
(excluding '2'). If this block is found adjacent to a '0' on the side *away* from the pivot ('2'), 
the block shifts one position towards the pivot. This shift involves replacing the adjacent '0' with 
the block's digit and setting the cell at the original trailing edge of the block 
(leftmost for a right shift, rightmost for a left shift) to '0'. If no block is 
found, the pivot is missing, or the adjacency condition is not met, the input 
sequence remains unchanged. The function returns the transformed list.
