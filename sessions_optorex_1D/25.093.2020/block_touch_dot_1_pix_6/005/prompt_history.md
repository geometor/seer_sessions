*   **Perception of Elements:** The input and output are 1D sequences (arrays) of single digits. The digit '0' appears frequently and seems to represent empty space or background. The digit '2' appears exactly once in each sequence and acts as a reference point or pivot. Other non-zero digits ('5', '6', '7', '8', '9') form contiguous blocks. The transformation involves the potential movement (shifting) of one such block relative to the '2'.

        properties:
          - required condition for shift (on the side opposite the pivot)
    invariants:
      - The digit '2' remains in its original position.
      - Digits not part of the shifted block and not the replaced '0' remain in their original positions.
      - The length of the sequence remains constant.
      - Only one block shifts per transformation.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the position of the unique digit '2' in the input sequence.
    2.  Scan the sequence to find all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
    3.  For each block found:
        a.  Determine if the block is located entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the '2'.
        b.  **If the block is to the right of '2':** Check if the cell immediately preceding the block contains a '0'. If it does, this block is the target for shifting.
        c.  **If the block is to the left of '2':** Check if the cell immediately following the block contains a '0'. If it does, this block is the target for shifting.
    4.  If a target block for shifting was identified:
        a.  **If the target block was to the right of '2' (and preceded by '0'):** Create the output sequence by copying the input, then change the '0' immediately before the block to the digit of the block, and change the last digit of the original block position to '0'.
        b.  **If the target block was to the left of '2' (and followed by '0'):** Create the output sequence by copying the input, then change the '0' immediately after the block to the digit of the block, and change the first digit of the original block position to '0'.
    5.  If no target block for shifting was identified (either no blocks exist, or none meet the adjacency-to-'0' condition), the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The core issue is a type mismatch. The provided Python code uses list-specific methods (`.index()`) which are not available on NumPy arrays, leading to the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'` on all examples. The underlying transformation logic described in the natural language program and implemented in the code (finding a pivot '2', identifying a single non-zero block, and conditionally shifting it one step towards the pivot if adjacent to a '0' on the side away from the pivot) appears consistent with the input/output pairs when mentally simulated. The strategy is to modify the code to handle NumPy array inputs, likely by converting the input array to a list at the beginning of the `transform` function.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   All 7 training examples failed execution.
    *   The error message was identical for all failures: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`.
    *   This confirms the input type is consistently `numpy.ndarray`.
    *   Analysis of inputs/outputs suggests the transformation logic itself is likely correct, pending the type fix. Let's verify properties of the data:

    *   The metrics confirm:
        *   All inputs are 1D arrays (shape `(12,)`).
        *   The pivot '2' is present in all examples.
        *   Exactly one contiguous block of non-zero, non-pivot digits exists in each input.
        *   Shifts occur only in examples 1, 4, 5, and 7, aligning with the described condition (adjacent '0' away from the pivot).

    data_format:
      - input_type: numpy.ndarray (observed)
      - element_type: integer digits

      - element: digit_0
        properties:
          - role: background/empty_space
          - enables_shift: when adjacent to a block on the side away from the pivot

        properties:
          - role: pivot/reference_point
          - cardinality: exactly one per sequence
          - determines_shift_direction: block shifts towards pivot
          - invariant: position does not change
      - element: non_zero_block
        properties:
          - type: contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits (excluding '2')
          - cardinality: exactly one per sequence (observed)
          - can_be_shifted: true
    actions:
      - action: shift_block_towards_pivot
        properties:
          - target: non_zero_block
          - condition: block must be adjacent to a '0' on the side opposite the pivot
          - direction: one position towards pivot '2'
          - effect_on_adjacent_0: replaced by the digit from the moving block
          - effect_on_trailing_edge: the original cell at the trailing edge of the block becomes '0'
          - cardinality: at most one shift per transformation
    invariants:
      - The position of '2' remains unchanged.
      - Digits not part of the shifted block and not the affected '0's remain in their original positions.
      - The length of the sequence remains constant.
      - Only the single identified block can shift.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input, which is a 1D NumPy array of integers. Convert this array into a standard Python list. Create a copy of this list to store the output.
    2.  Identify the index (position) of the unique digit '2' (the pivot) in the list. If '2' is not found, return the original list.
    3.  Scan the list to find the single contiguous block of identical digits that are neither '0' nor '2'. Record its start index, end index, and the digit value. If no such block is found, return the original list.
    4.  Determine if the found block is located entirely to the left (end index < pivot index) or entirely to the right (start index > pivot index) of the pivot.
    5.  **If the block is to the right of the pivot:** Check if the cell immediately preceding the block (at index `start - 1`) exists and contains a '0'.
        a.  If yes, modify the output list: Change the value at index `start - 1` to the block's digit and change the value at the block's original end index (`end`) to '0'.
    6.  **If the block is to the left of the pivot:** Check if the cell immediately following the block (at index `end + 1`) exists and contains a '0'.
        a.  If yes, modify the output list: Change the value at index `end + 1` to the block's digit and change the value at the block's original start index (`start`) to '0'.
    7.  If neither of the conditions in steps 5 or 6 was met, the output list remains identical to the input list copy.
    8.  Return the final (potentially modified) output list.
