If this block is found adjacent to a '0' on the side *away* from the pivot ('2'), \nthe block shifts one position towards the pivot. This shift involves replacing the adjacent '0' with \nthe block's digit and setting the cell at the original trailing edge of the block \n(leftmost for a right shift, rightmost for a left shift) to '0'. If no block is \nfound, the pivot is missing, or the adjacency condition is not met, the input \nsequence remains unchanged.
