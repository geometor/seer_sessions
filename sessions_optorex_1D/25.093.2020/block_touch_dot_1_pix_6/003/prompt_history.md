*   **Perception of Elements:** The input and output are 1D sequences (arrays) of single digits. The digit '0' appears frequently and seems to represent empty space or background. The digit '2' appears exactly once in each sequence and acts as a reference point or pivot. Other non-zero digits ('5', '6', '7', '8', '9') form contiguous blocks. The transformation involves the potential movement (shifting) of one such block relative to the '2'.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the position of the unique digit '2' in the input sequence.
    2.  Scan the sequence to find all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
    3.  For each block found:
        a.  Determine if the block is located entirely to the left or entirely to the right of the '2'.
        b.  **If the block is to the right of '2':** Check if the cell immediately preceding the block contains a '0'. If it does, this block is the target for shifting.
        c.  **If the block is to the left of '2':** Check if the cell immediately following the block contains a '0'. If it does, this block is the target for shifting.
    4.  If a target block for shifting was identified:
        a.  **If the target block was to the right of '2' (and preceded by '0'):** Create the output sequence by copying the input, then change the '0' immediately before the block to the digit of the block, and change the last digit of the original block position to '0'.
        b.  **If the target block was to the left of '2' (and followed by '0'):** Create the output sequence by copying the input, then change the '0' immediately after the block to the digit of the block, and change the first digit of the original block position to '0'.
    5.  If no target block for shifting was identified (either no blocks exist, or none meet the adjacency-to-'0' condition), the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The core issue identified is an input type mismatch. The provided `transform` function expects a string input (due to `input_str.split()`) but received a NumPy array during testing, causing the `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` error across all examples. The underlying transformation logic, however, appears consistent with the examples when checked manually against the hypothesis.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Modify Input Handling:** Adjust the `transform` function to accept a list of integers directly, removing the `parse_input` call from within it. The expectation will be that the input is already parsed into a list before being passed to `transform`. The `format_output` function is also unnecessary if the function is expected to return a list. We will assume the function should now take a list and return a list.
2.  **Validate Logic:** Confirm the block identification and shifting logic remains correct based on the manual analysis and metrics gathered.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the list input/output and solidify the understanding of the transformation rule.

## Metrics

Based on manual analysis and the code execution to gather structural information:


```

]
```


**Observations from Metrics:**

*   All inputs are lists of length 12.
*   A single pivot digit '2' exists in every input.
*   A single contiguous block of identical non-zero, non-pivot digits exists in every input.
*   A shift occurs if and only if the block is adjacent to a '0' on the side *away* from the pivot '2'.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a list of integers.
2.  Create a copy of the input list to serve as the potential output list.
3.  Identify the index (position) of the unique digit '2' (the pivot) in the list. If '2' is not found, return the original list.
4.  Scan the list to find the start index, end index, and digit value of the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (that are not '2').
5.  If no such block is found, return the original list.
6.  Determine if the found block is located to the left or right of the pivot index.
7.  **If the block is to the right of the pivot:**
    a.  Check if the index immediately before the block's start index is valid (i.e., >= 0) and if the value at that index in the list is '0'.
    b.  If both conditions are true, modify the copied output list: change the value at the index *before* the block's start to the block's digit, and change the value at the block's original *end* index to '0'. This performs a leftward shift.
8.  **If the block is to the left of the pivot:**
    a.  Check if the index immediately after the block's end index is valid (i.e., < list length) and if the value at that index in the list is '0'.
    b.  If both conditions are true, modify the copied output list: change the value at the index *after* the block's end to the block's digit, and change the value at the block's original *start* index to '0'. This performs a rightward shift.
9.  If neither of the shift conditions (in step 7 or 8) was met, the copied output list remains unchanged from the original input.
10. Return the (potentially modified) output list.
