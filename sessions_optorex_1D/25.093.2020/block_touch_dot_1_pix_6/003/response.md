"""
Identifies the unique pivot digit '2' in a 1D list of integers. Finds the single 
contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (excluding '2'). If this block is 
found adjacent to a '0' on the side *away* from the pivot ('2'), the block shifts 
one position towards the pivot. This shift involves replacing the adjacent '0' with 
the block's digit and setting the cell at the original trailing edge of the block 
(leftmost for a right shift, rightmost for a left shift) to '0'. If no block is 
found, the pivot is missing, or the adjacency condition is not met, the input 
list remains unchanged. The function returns the transformed list.
