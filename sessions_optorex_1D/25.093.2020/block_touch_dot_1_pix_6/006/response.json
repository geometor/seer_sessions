            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided Python code (`code_00.py`) attempts to implement the transformation rule observed in the initial examples. The core logic involves identifying a pivot ('2'), a single contiguous block of non-zero/non-pivot digits, and shifting this block one step towards the pivot *if* there is a '0' adjacent to the block on the side opposite the pivot.\n\nHowever, the execution results show that the code fails on examples `train_1`, `train_4`, `train_5`, and `train_7`. In all these failing cases, the expected output involves a shift of the block, but the code's output is identical to the input, indicating the shift was not performed. Conversely, the code succeeds on examples where no shift is expected (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_6`, `test_1`).\n\nThis pattern strongly suggests that the code correctly identifies situations where *no* shift should occur, but fails to execute the shift when the conditions *are* met according to the rule derived from the input/output pairs. The conditions for the shift (block exists, pivot exists, '0' is adjacent on the side away from the pivot) seem correctly identified in the natural language program and appear to be checked in the code's conditional statements.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Conditions:** Programmatically analyze each training example to confirm the presence of the pivot, the block, its position relative to the pivot, and the value of the crucial adjacent cell ('0' on the side away from the pivot). This will confirm if the conditions for the shift were indeed met in the failing examples.\n2.  **Refine Rule Description:** Assuming the execution results point to a flaw in the previous code's implementation rather than a misunderstanding of the rule itself (since the rule derived matches the *expected* outputs), refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to be maximally clear about the conditions and the shift mechanism. Focus on the precise conditions triggering the shift. The goal is to describe the transformation visible in the *data*, even if the provided code failed to replicate it.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nLet's analyze each training example to verify the conditions for the transformation.\n"
