task_elements:
  - element: sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D array of single digits
      - contains_pivot: yes, the digit '2'
      - contains_blocks: potentially one contiguous block of identical digits (not '0' or '2')
      - length_invariant: true
  - element: digit_0
    properties:
      - role: background / empty space
      - trigger_for_shift: if located adjacent to the block on the side away from the pivot
  - element: digit_2
    properties:
      - role: pivot / reference point
      - cardinality: exactly one per sequence
      - position_invariant: true
      - determines_shift_direction: yes (block moves towards pivot)
  - element: non_zero_non_pivot_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of identical digits (e.g., 5 5 5, 8 8)
      - condition: digits are not '0' and not '2'
      - cardinality: at most one such block per sequence (based on examples)
      - action_subject: can be shifted if conditions met

actions:
  - action: shift_block_towards_pivot
    properties:
      - target: non_zero_non_pivot_block
      - condition: must be adjacent to a '0' on the side facing away from the pivot '2'
      - direction: one step towards the pivot '2'
      - mechanism:
          - The adjacent '0' (trigger) is replaced by the block's digit.
          - The cell at the original trailing edge of the block becomes '0'.
            - Trailing edge = rightmost cell of the block if shift is leftward.
            - Trailing edge = leftmost cell of the block if shift is rightward.
      - cardinality: occurs at most once if conditions are met; otherwise, no change.

relationships:
  - relationship: block_position_relative_to_pivot
    between: [non_zero_non_pivot_block, digit_2]
    properties:
      - determines which side is "away" from the pivot for the adjacency check
      - determines shift direction (leftward if block is right of pivot, rightward if block is left of pivot)
  - relationship: adjacency_for_shift
    between: [non_zero_non_pivot_block, digit_0]
    properties:
      - location: must be the cell immediately adjacent to the block on the side opposite the pivot.
      - required: this specific adjacency to '0' is necessary to trigger the shift.

invariants:
  - Position of the pivot '2'.
  - Digits not part of the block and not the '0' involved in the shift.
  - Length of the sequence.
  - Identity (digit value) of the block being shifted.
  - Only one block exists and potentially shifts.
