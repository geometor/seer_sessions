The digit '0' appears frequently and seems to represent empty space or background. The digit '2' appears exactly once in each sequence and acts as a reference point or pivot. Other non-zero digits ('5', '6', '7', '8', '9') form contiguous blocks. The transformation involves the potential movement (shifting) of one such block relative to the '2'.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
