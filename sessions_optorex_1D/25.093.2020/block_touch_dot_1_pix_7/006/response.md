**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: shifting blocks of non-zero integers (excluding '2') towards the position of '2', unless the block is immediately adjacent to '2'. The failure occurred during execution due to a NumPy-specific error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous"). This suggests an issue in how boolean conditions involving NumPy arrays were handled, likely within the `_find_blocks` helper function's loop, even though the intended logic appeared sound for 1D arrays.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-confirm the transformation logic against all provided examples.
2.  Refine the description of objects, properties, and actions based on this confirmed logic.
3.  Rewrite the natural language program to be precise and unambiguous, emphasizing the conditions for shifting (non-adjacency and relative position) and the mechanism (copy, shift block, fill vacated space with 0).
4.  The subsequent coding phase should pay close attention to implementing the block finding and shifting logic, potentially using standard Python iteration instead of relying heavily on NumPy vectorization for the control flow aspects that caused the previous error, while still using NumPy for array handling if beneficial.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an exact, modifiable copy of the input sequence; this will become the output sequence.
2.  Find the index (position) of the integer '2' in the original input sequence. If '2' is not present, return the unmodified copy.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero integers (excluding '2') in the *original input* sequence. For each block, record its starting and ending index.
4.  Iterate through the identified blocks based on their positions in the original input sequence. For each block:
    a.  Check if the block is immediately adjacent to '2'. Adjacency means the block ends exactly one position before '2' (at index `position_of_2 - 1`) or starts exactly one position after '2' (at index `position_of_2 + 1`).
    b.  If the block *is* adjacent to '2', do nothing to the output sequence for this block and proceed to the next block.
    c.  If the block is *not* adjacent to '2':
        i.  Determine if the block is located entirely *before* '2' (i.e., the block's end index is less than `position_of_2`).
        ii. If the block is before '2', shift its elements one position to the right *within the output sequence*. Specifically, copy the block's values from the input sequence (`input[start_index:end_index+1]`) into the output sequence at the new positions (`output[start_index+1:end_index+2]`). Then, set the element at the original starting position of the block (`output[start_index]`) to '0'. Ensure the shift does not go beyond the sequence bounds.
        iii. Determine if the block is located entirely *after* '2' (i.e., the block's start index is greater than `position_of_2`).
        iv. If the block is after '2', shift its elements one position to the left *within the output sequence*. Specifically, copy the block's values from the input sequence (`input[start_index:end_index+1]`) into the output sequence at the new positions (`output[start_index-1:end_index]`). Then, set the element at the original ending position of the block (`output[end_index]`) to '0'. Ensure the shift does not go beyond the sequence bounds.
5.  After processing all blocks, return the modified output sequence.
