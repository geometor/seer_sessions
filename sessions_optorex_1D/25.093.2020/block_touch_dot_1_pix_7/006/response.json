            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation logic: shifting blocks of non-zero integers (excluding '2') towards the position of '2', unless the block is immediately adjacent to '2'. The failure occurred during execution due to a NumPy-specific error (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\"). This suggests an issue in how boolean conditions involving NumPy arrays were handled, likely within the `_find_blocks` helper function's loop, even though the intended logic appeared sound for 1D arrays.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-confirm the transformation logic against all provided examples.\n2.  Refine the description of objects, properties, and actions based on this confirmed logic.\n3.  Rewrite the natural language program to be precise and unambiguous, emphasizing the conditions for shifting (non-adjacency and relative position) and the mechanism (copy, shift block, fill vacated space with 0).\n4.  The subsequent coding phase should pay close attention to implementing the block finding and shifting logic, potentially using standard Python iteration instead of relying heavily on NumPy vectorization for the control flow aspects that caused the previous error, while still using NumPy for array handling if beneficial.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nManual analysis confirms the logic across all training examples:\n\n| Example | Input Sequence             | Output Sequence            | Index of '2' | Blocks Found (start, end) | Relative Pos | Adjacent | Action        | Output Matches? |\n| :------ | :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------- | :------------------------ | :----------- | :------- | :------------ | :-------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7 7 7 7]` | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7 7 7 7]` | 7            | (8, 11)                   | After        | Yes      | None          | Yes             |\n| train_2 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 5]` | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 5]` | 10           | (11, 11)                  | After        | Yes      | None          | Yes             |\n| train_3 | `[0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 0 0]` | `[0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 2 0 0]` | 9            | (2, 4)                    | Before       | No       | Shift Right   | Yes             |\n| train_4 | `[2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0]` | `[2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0]` | 0            | (9, 9)                    | After        | No       | Shift Left    | Yes             |\n| train_5 | `[0 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0]` | `[0 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]` | 1            | (6, 8)                    | After        | No       | Shift Left    | Yes             |\n| train_6 | `[0 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0]` | `[0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0]` | 7            | (2, 2)                    | Before       | No       | Shift Right   | Yes             |\n| train_7 | `[0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 2 0]` | `[0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 2 0]` | 10           | (1, 8)                    | Before       | No       | Shift Right   | Yes             |\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
