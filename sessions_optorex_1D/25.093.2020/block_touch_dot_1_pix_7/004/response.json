            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed on all training examples with a NumPy-related error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.\" This error typically occurs when a boolean array resulting from a NumPy comparison (e.g., `array == value`) is used in a standard Python `if` or `while` statement, which expects a single boolean value.\n\nThe manual trace of the intended logic on several examples confirms that the core algorithm described in the previous natural language program is correct:\n1.  Find the integer '2'.\n2.  Identify contiguous blocks of other non-zero integers.\n3.  Check if blocks are adjacent to '2'. Adjacent blocks are unchanged.\n4.  Non-adjacent blocks before '2' shift right by one position.\n5.  Non-adjacent blocks after '2' shift left by one position.\n6.  The position vacated by the shift is filled with '0'.\n\nThe implementation error likely resides in the `_find_blocks` function, specifically within the `while` loop condition that combines NumPy array element checks (`grid[i + 1] != 0`) with standard Python logical operators (`and`). This suggests an issue with how array elements or comparisons are evaluated in that context, possibly due to unexpected data types or dimensionality, or simply needing explicit handling of the boolean result (e.g., ensuring it's scalar before Python's `and` uses it).\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Maintain the core transformation logic as described, as it correctly explains the input/output pairs.\n2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for clarity, emphasizing the adjacency rule and the shift mechanics (copying the block, placing a zero).\n3.  Acknowledge the implementation error and note that the coder phase must resolve the NumPy boolean ambiguity issue, likely by carefully managing comparisons within loop conditions.\n\n**Metrics (Manually Derived from Examples)**\n\nSince the code execution failed, these metrics are based on manual analysis:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,7,7,7,7]`. `index_of_2 = 7`. Block `(8, 11)` value `7777`. Adjacent (starts at index_of_2 + 1). No shift. Output matches input.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,5]`. `index_of_2 = 10`. Block `(11, 11)` value `5`. Adjacent (starts at index_of_2 + 1). No shift. Output matches input.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]`. `index_of_2 = 9`. Block `(2, 4)` value `444`. Before '2', not adjacent (ends at 4, index_of_2 - 1 = 8). Shift right. Output: `[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,2,0,0]`.\n*   **Example 4:** Input `[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]`. `index_of_2 = 0`. Block `(9, 9)` value `3`. After '2', not adjacent (starts at 9, index_of_2 + 1 = 1). Shift left. Output: `[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]`.\n*   **Example 5:** Input `[0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]`. `index_of_2 = 1`. Block `(6, 8)` value `111`. After '2', not adjacent (starts at 6, index_of_2 + 1 = 2). Shift left. Output: `[0,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]`.\n*   **Example 6:** Input `[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]`. `index_of_2 = 7`. Block `(2, 2)` value `5`. Before '2', not adjacent (ends at 2, index_of_2 - 1 = 6). Shift right. Output: `[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]`.\n*   **Example 7:** Input `[0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,2,0]`. `index_of_2 = 10`. Block `(1, 8)` value `4...4`. Before '2', not adjacent (ends at 8, index_of_2 - 1 = 9). Shift right. Output: `[0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,0]`.\n\nThe logic consistently explains the transformations.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts**\n\n"
