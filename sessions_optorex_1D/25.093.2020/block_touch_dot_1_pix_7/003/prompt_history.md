**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers based on specific rules.
1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (arrays or lists) of 12 integers.
2.  **Key Element:** The integer '2' plays a crucial role in determining the transformation. Its position is important.
3.  **Other Non-Zero Elements:** Other non-zero integers often appear in contiguous blocks (e.g., `4 4 4`, `7 7 7 7`, `1 1 1`). The integer '0' acts as a background or filler.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting these non-zero blocks (excluding '2') either one position to the left or one position to the right.
5.  **Condition for Shifting:** The direction of the shift depends on the block's position relative to the '2'. Blocks *before* the '2' shift right. Blocks *after* the '2' shift left.
6.  **Exception to Shifting:** Blocks that are immediately adjacent to the '2' (either directly before or directly after) do not shift.
7.  **Mechanism of Shifting:** When a block shifts, the position it vacates is filled with a '0'. The '2' itself does not move.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
2.  Find the index (position) of the integer '2' in the input sequence.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero integers (where the integers are not '2') in the input sequence. For each block, record its start and end indices.
4.  Iterate through each identified block:
    a.  Check if the block is immediately adjacent to '2'. A block ending at index `position_of_2 - 1` or starting at index `position_of_2 + 1` is considered adjacent.
    b.  If the block is adjacent to '2', do nothing and proceed to the next block.
    c.  If the block is not adjacent to '2':
        i.  Determine if the block is located entirely *before* '2' (i.e., the block's end index is less than the position of '2').
        ii. If the block is before '2', shift the elements of this block in the *output sequence* one position to the right. Place a '0' in the original starting position (start index) of the block in the output sequence.
        iii. Determine if the block is located entirely *after* '2' (i.e., the block's start index is greater than the position of '2').
        iv. If the block is after '2', shift the elements of this block in the *output sequence* one position to the left. Place a '0' in the original ending position (end index) of the block in the output sequence.
5.  Return the modified output sequence.

*(Self-correction during thought process: Initially considered shifting based only on relative position, but examples 1 & 2 showed adjacency matters. Also clarified the shifting mechanism involves moving the block content and inserting a zero at the vacated end.)*
*(Self-correction 2: The program needs to operate on a copy of the input or apply changes carefully to avoid issues if multiple blocks shift. The description now specifies modifying an output sequence initialized from the input.)*

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis and natural language program accurately captured the core logic of the transformation. The provided Python code failed because it assumed the input data structure was a standard Python list and used list-specific methods (like `.index()`), while the execution environment provided NumPy arrays.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge Data Type:** Recognize that the input is consistently a NumPy array.
2.  **Adapt Implementation:** Modify the Python code to use NumPy functions and array operations instead of list methods. For example, use `np.where(array == 2)[0][0]` to find the index of '2', and NumPy slicing and assignment for block identification and shifting.
3.  **Validate Logic:** The core logic (finding '2', identifying blocks, checking adjacency, shifting non-adjacent blocks based on relative position) appears sound and consistent across all examples. No changes to the fundamental transformation rule seem necessary based on the provided examples and errors. The focus is on correcting the implementation's data handling.
4.  **Refine Descriptions:** Ensure the YAML facts and natural language program are clear about the data structures involved (sequences/arrays) and the operations performed.

## Metrics and Example Analysis

The code failed execution for all examples due to the same fundamental error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This prevents generating output metrics for comparison. However, a manual re-evaluation of the logic against each example confirms the initial understanding:

*   **Examples 1 & 2:** Show that blocks immediately adjacent to '2' (after '2' in these cases) are not shifted.
*   **Examples 3, 6 & 7:** Show that blocks located *before* '2' and not adjacent to it are shifted one position to the *right*. The vacated starting position becomes '0'.
*   **Examples 4 & 5:** Show that blocks located *after* '2' and not adjacent to it are shifted one position to the *left*. The vacated ending position becomes '0'.

The rule holds consistently across all training examples provided. The error is solely related to the code's inability to handle the NumPy array input type.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a copy of the input sequence (NumPy array) to serve as the initial output sequence.
2.  Find the index (position) of the integer '2' in the input sequence. If '2' is not present, return the unmodified copy.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero integers (where the integers are not '2') in the *input* sequence. For each block, record its start and end indices.
4.  Iterate through each identified block:
    a.  Check if the block is immediately adjacent to '2' (i.e., ends at `index_of_2 - 1` or starts at `index_of_2 + 1`).
    b.  If the block is adjacent to '2', make no changes to the output sequence for this block and proceed to the next block.
    c.  If the block is *not* adjacent to '2':
        i.  Determine if the block is located entirely *before* '2' (block's `end_index < index_of_2`).
        ii. If the block is before '2', check if shifting right is possible (i.e., `end_index + 1` is within the array bounds). If possible, copy the block's values from the *input* sequence to the positions `start_index + 1` through `end_index + 1` in the *output* sequence, and set the element at `start_index` in the *output* sequence to '0'.
        iii. Determine if the block is located entirely *after* '2' (block's `start_index > index_of_2`).
        iv. If the block is after '2', check if shifting left is possible (i.e., `start_index - 1` is within the array bounds). If possible, copy the block's values from the *input* sequence to the positions `start_index - 1` through `end_index - 1` in the *output* sequence, and set the element at `end_index` in the *output* sequence to '0'.
5.  Return the modified output sequence (NumPy array).
