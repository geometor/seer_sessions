            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis and natural language program accurately captured the core logic of the transformation. The provided Python code failed because it assumed the input data structure was a standard Python list and used list-specific methods (like `.index()`), while the execution environment provided NumPy arrays.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Data Type:** Recognize that the input is consistently a NumPy array.\n2.  **Adapt Implementation:** Modify the Python code to use NumPy functions and array operations instead of list methods. For example, use `np.where(array == 2)[0][0]` to find the index of '2', and NumPy slicing and assignment for block identification and shifting.\n3.  **Validate Logic:** The core logic (finding '2', identifying blocks, checking adjacency, shifting non-adjacent blocks based on relative position) appears sound and consistent across all examples. No changes to the fundamental transformation rule seem necessary based on the provided examples and errors. The focus is on correcting the implementation's data handling.\n4.  **Refine Descriptions:** Ensure the YAML facts and natural language program are clear about the data structures involved (sequences/arrays) and the operations performed.\n\n## Metrics and Example Analysis\n\nThe code failed execution for all examples due to the same fundamental error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This prevents generating output metrics for comparison. However, a manual re-evaluation of the logic against each example confirms the initial understanding:\n\n*   **Examples 1 & 2:** Show that blocks immediately adjacent to '2' (after '2' in these cases) are not shifted.\n*   **Examples 3, 6 & 7:** Show that blocks located *before* '2' and not adjacent to it are shifted one position to the *right*. The vacated starting position becomes '0'.\n*   **Examples 4 & 5:** Show that blocks located *after* '2' and not adjacent to it are shifted one position to the *left*. The vacated ending position becomes '0'.\n\nThe rule holds consistently across all training examples provided. The error is solely related to the code's inability to handle the NumPy array input type.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
