elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A 1D NumPy array of 12 integers representing the input and output state.
    properties:
      - data_type: numpy.ndarray
      - length: 12
      - values: Integers, including 0, 2, and others.
  - object: integer_2
    description: A specific integer '2' acting as a reference point within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - position: The index of '2' in the sequence (assuming unique occurrence).
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of one or more non-zero integers, excluding '2'.
    properties:
      - values: The integers comprising the block.
      - start_index: The starting index of the block in the sequence.
      - end_index: The ending index of the block (inclusive) in the sequence.
      - location_relative_to_2: Whether the block appears entirely before (end_index < index_of_2) or entirely after (start_index > index_of_2) the integer '2'.
      - adjacent_to_2: Whether the block ends immediately before '2' (end_index == index_of_2 - 1) or starts immediately after '2' (start_index == index_of_2 + 1).
  - object: integer_0
    description: The integer '0', acting as a separator, filler, or background value.

actions:
  - action: find_integer_2
    description: Locate the index of the integer '2' within the input sequence (NumPy array).
  - action: identify_blocks
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero integers (excluding '2') in the sequence. Determine their start and end indices.
  - action: check_adjacency
    description: For each identified block, determine if it is immediately adjacent to the position of '2'.
  - action: determine_relative_location
    description: For each block, determine if its indices are entirely less than or entirely greater than the index of '2'.
  - action: shift_block_right
    description: Modify the output sequence by moving the elements of a block one position to the right. Set the original start_index position to '0'. Applied only if the block is before '2' and not adjacent.
  - action: shift_block_left
    description: Modify the output sequence by moving the elements of a block one position to the left. Set the original end_index position to '0'. Applied only if the block is after '2' and not adjacent.
  - action: copy_sequence
    description: Create a modifiable copy of the input NumPy array to build the output sequence.

relationships:
  - relationship: shift_dependency
    description: The transformation applied to a block depends on its adjacency and location relative to the integer '2'.
    conditions:
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == true
        then: no shift occurs for that block.
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == false AND location_relative_to_2 == before
        then: shift_block_right is performed on that block in the output sequence.
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == false AND location_relative_to_2 == after
        then: shift_block_left is performed on that block in the output sequence.
