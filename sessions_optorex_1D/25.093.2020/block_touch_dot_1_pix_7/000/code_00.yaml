elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A list of 12 integers representing the input and output state.
  - object: integer_2
    description: A specific integer '2' acting as a reference point within the sequence.
    properties:
      - position: The index of '2' in the sequence.
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of one or more non-zero integers, excluding '2'.
    properties:
      - values: The integers comprising the block.
      - start_index: The starting index of the block in the sequence.
      - end_index: The ending index of the block in the sequence.
      - location_relative_to_2: Whether the block appears before or after '2' in the sequence.
      - adjacent_to_2: Whether the block is immediately next to '2' (no '0's in between).
  - object: integer_0
    description: The integer '0', often acting as a separator or filler.

actions:
  - action: find_integer_2
    description: Locate the index of the integer '2'.
  - action: identify_blocks
    description: Find all contiguous blocks of non-zero integers (not '2') in the sequence.
  - action: check_adjacency
    description: Determine if a block's start or end index is immediately adjacent to the index of '2'.
  - action: determine_relative_location
    description: Determine if a block's indices are all less than (before) or all greater than (after) the index of '2'.
  - action: shift_block_right
    description: Move all elements of a block one position to the right, filling the original start_index with '0'.
  - action: shift_block_left
    description: Move all elements of a block one position to the left, filling the original end_index with '0'.
  - action: copy_sequence
    description: Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence to build the output.

relationships:
  - relationship: shift_dependency
    description: The decision to shift a block and the direction of the shift depend on its adjacency and location relative to '2'.
    conditions:
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == true
        then: no shift occurs.
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == false AND location_relative_to_2 == before
        then: shift_block_right is performed.
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == false AND location_relative_to_2 == after
        then: shift_block_left is performed.
