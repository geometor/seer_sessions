**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers based on specific rules.
1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (arrays or lists) of 12 integers.
2.  **Key Element:** The integer '2' plays a crucial role in determining the transformation. Its position is important.
3.  **Other Non-Zero Elements:** Other non-zero integers often appear in contiguous blocks (e.g., `4 4 4`, `7 7 7 7`, `1 1 1`). The integer '0' acts as a background or filler.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting these non-zero blocks (excluding '2') either one position to the left or one position to the right.
5.  **Condition for Shifting:** The direction of the shift depends on the block's position relative to the '2'. Blocks *before* the '2' shift right. Blocks *after* the '2' shift left.
6.  **Exception to Shifting:** Blocks that are immediately adjacent to the '2' (either directly before or directly after) do not shift.
7.  **Mechanism of Shifting:** When a block shifts, the position it vacates is filled with a '0'. The '2' itself does not move.

**Facts:**

      - adjacent_to_2: Whether the block is immediately next to '2' (no '0's in between).
  - object: integer_0
    description: The integer '0', often acting as a separator or filler.

relationships:
  - relationship: shift_dependency
    description: The decision to shift a block and the direction of the shift depend on its adjacency and location relative to '2'.
    conditions:
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == true
        then: no shift occurs.
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == false AND location_relative_to_2 == before
        then: shift_block_right is performed.
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == false AND location_relative_to_2 == after
        then: shift_block_left is performed.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
2.  Find the index (position) of the integer '2' in the input sequence.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero integers (where the integers are not '2') in the input sequence. For each block, record its start and end indices.
4.  Iterate through each identified block:
    a.  Check if the block is immediately adjacent to '2'. A block ending at index `position_of_2 - 1` or starting at index `position_of_2 + 1` is considered adjacent.
    b.  If the block is adjacent to '2', do nothing and proceed to the next block.
    c.  If the block is not adjacent to '2':
        i.  Determine if the block is located entirely *before* '2' (i.e., the block's end index is less than the position of '2').
        ii. If the block is before '2', shift the elements of this block in the *output sequence* one position to the right. Place a '0' in the original starting position (start index) of the block in the output sequence.
        iii. Determine if the block is located entirely *after* '2' (i.e., the block's start index is greater than the position of '2').
        iv. If the block is after '2', shift the elements of this block in the *output sequence* one position to the left. Place a '0' in the original ending position (end index) of the block in the output sequence.
5.  Return the modified output sequence.

*(Self-correction during thought process: Initially considered shifting based only on relative position, but examples 1 & 2 showed adjacency matters. Also clarified the shifting mechanism involves moving the block content and inserting a zero at the vacated end.)*
*(Self-correction 2: The program needs to operate on a copy of the input or apply changes carefully to avoid issues if multiple blocks shift. The description now specifies modifying an output sequence initialized from the input.)*
