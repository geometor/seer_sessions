            "text": "**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers based on specific rules.\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (arrays or lists) of 12 integers.\n2.  **Key Element:** The integer '2' plays a crucial role in determining the transformation. Its position is important.\n3.  **Other Non-Zero Elements:** Other non-zero integers often appear in contiguous blocks (e.g., `4 4 4`, `7 7 7 7`, `1 1 1`). The integer '0' acts as a background or filler.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting these non-zero blocks (excluding '2') either one position to the left or one position to the right.\n5.  **Condition for Shifting:** The direction of the shift depends on the block's position relative to the '2'. Blocks *before* the '2' shift right. Blocks *after* the '2' shift left.\n6.  **Exception to Shifting:** Blocks that are immediately adjacent to the '2' (either directly before or directly after) do not shift.\n7.  **Mechanism of Shifting:** When a block shifts, the position it vacates is filled with a '0'. The '2' itself does not move.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Also clarified the shifting mechanism involves moving the block content and inserting a zero at the vacated end.)*\n*(Self-correction 2: The program needs to operate on a copy of the input or apply changes carefully to avoid issues if multiple blocks shift. The description now specifies modifying an output sequence initialized from the input.)*"
