**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers based on specific rules.
1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (arrays or lists) of 12 integers.
2.  **Key Element:** The integer '2' plays a crucial role in determining the transformation. Its position is important.
3.  **Other Non-Zero Elements:** Other non-zero integers often appear in contiguous blocks (e.g., `4 4 4`, `7 7 7 7`, `1 1 1`). The integer '0' acts as a background or filler.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting these non-zero blocks (excluding '2') either one position to the left or one position to the right.
5.  **Condition for Shifting:** The direction of the shift depends on the block's position relative to the '2'. Blocks *before* the '2' shift right. Blocks *after* the '2' shift left.
6.  **Exception to Shifting:** Blocks that are immediately adjacent to the '2' (either directly before or directly after) do not shift.
7.  **Mechanism of Shifting:** When a block shifts, the position it vacates is filled with a '0'. The '2' itself does not move.

**Facts:**

    conditions:
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == true
        then: no shift occurs.
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == false AND location_relative_to_2 == before
        then: shift_block_right is performed.
      - if: block is adjacent_to_2 == false AND location_relative_to_2 == after
        then: shift_block_left is performed.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
2.  Find the index (position) of the integer '2' in the input sequence.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero integers (where the integers are not '2') in the input sequence. For each block, record its start and end indices.
4.  Iterate through each identified block:
    a.  Check if the block is immediately adjacent to '2'. A block ending at index `position_of_2 - 1` or starting at index `position_of_2 + 1` is considered adjacent.
    b.  If the block is adjacent to '2', do nothing and proceed to the next block.
    c.  If the block is not adjacent to '2':
        i.  Determine if the block is located entirely *before* '2' (i.e., the block's end index is less than the position of '2').
        ii. If the block is before '2', shift the elements of this block in the *output sequence* one position to the right. Place a '0' in the original starting position (start index) of the block in the output sequence.
        iii. Determine if the block is located entirely *after* '2' (i.e., the block's start index is greater than the position of '2').
        iv. If the block is after '2', shift the elements of this block in the *output sequence* one position to the left. Place a '0' in the original ending position (end index) of the block in the output sequence.
5.  Return the modified output sequence.

*(Self-correction during thought process: Initially considered shifting based only on relative position, but examples 1 & 2 showed adjacency matters. Also clarified the shifting mechanism involves moving the block content and inserting a zero at the vacated end.)*
*(Self-correction 2: The program needs to operate on a copy of the input or apply changes carefully to avoid issues if multiple blocks shift. The description now specifies modifying an output sequence initialized from the input.)*

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed on all training examples with a NumPy-related error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous." This error typically occurs when a boolean array resulting from a NumPy comparison (e.g., `array == value`) is used in a standard Python `if` or `while` statement, which expects a single boolean value.

The manual trace of the intended logic on several examples confirms that the core algorithm described in the previous natural language program is correct:
1.  Find the integer '2'.
2.  Identify contiguous blocks of other non-zero integers.
3.  Check if blocks are adjacent to '2'. Adjacent blocks are unchanged.
4.  Non-adjacent blocks before '2' shift right by one position.
5.  Non-adjacent blocks after '2' shift left by one position.
6.  The position vacated by the shift is filled with '0'.

The implementation error likely resides in the `_find_blocks` function, specifically within the `while` loop condition that combines NumPy array element checks (`grid[i + 1] != 0`) with standard Python logical operators (`and`). This suggests an issue with how array elements or comparisons are evaluated in that context, possibly due to unexpected data types or dimensionality, or simply needing explicit handling of the boolean result (e.g., ensuring it's scalar before Python's `and` uses it).

**Strategy:**
1.  Maintain the core transformation logic as described, as it correctly explains the input/output pairs.
2.  Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program for clarity, emphasizing the adjacency rule and the shift mechanics (copying the block, placing a zero).
3.  Acknowledge the implementation error and note that the coder phase must resolve the NumPy boolean ambiguity issue, likely by carefully managing comparisons within loop conditions.

**Metrics (Manually Derived from Examples)**

Since the code execution failed, these metrics are based on manual analysis:

*   **Example 1:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,7,7,7,7]`. `index_of_2 = 7`. Block `(8, 11)` value `7777`. Adjacent (starts at index_of_2 + 1). No shift. Output matches input.
*   **Example 2:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,5]`. `index_of_2 = 10`. Block `(11, 11)` value `5`. Adjacent (starts at index_of_2 + 1). No shift. Output matches input.
*   **Example 3:** Input `[0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]`. `index_of_2 = 9`. Block `(2, 4)` value `444`. Before '2', not adjacent (ends at 4, index_of_2 - 1 = 8). Shift right. Output: `[0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,2,0,0]`.
*   **Example 4:** Input `[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]`. `index_of_2 = 0`. Block `(9, 9)` value `3`. After '2', not adjacent (starts at 9, index_of_2 + 1 = 1). Shift left. Output: `[2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0]`.
*   **Example 5:** Input `[0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]`. `index_of_2 = 1`. Block `(6, 8)` value `111`. After '2', not adjacent (starts at 6, index_of_2 + 1 = 2). Shift left. Output: `[0,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]`.
*   **Example 6:** Input `[0,0,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]`. `index_of_2 = 7`. Block `(2, 2)` value `5`. Before '2', not adjacent (ends at 2, index_of_2 - 1 = 6). Shift right. Output: `[0,0,0,5,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0]`.
*   **Example 7:** Input `[0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,2,0]`. `index_of_2 = 10`. Block `(1, 8)` value `4...4`. Before '2', not adjacent (ends at 8, index_of_2 - 1 = 9). Shift right. Output: `[0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,0]`.

The logic consistently explains the transformations.

      - Return the modified output sequence.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as an exact copy of the input sequence (which is a list/array of 12 integers).
2.  Find the index (position) of the integer '2' within the input sequence. Let this be `position_of_2`.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of non-zero integers in the *original input* sequence, excluding the integer '2' itself. For each block found, record its starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`).
4.  Iterate through each identified block (`start_index`, `end_index`):
    a.  Check if the block is immediately adjacent to '2'. This is true if `end_index` is equal to `position_of_2 - 1` OR if `start_index` is equal to `position_of_2 + 1`.
    b.  If the block is adjacent, make no changes to the output sequence for this block. Proceed to the next block.
    c.  If the block is *not* adjacent:
        i.  Determine if the block is located entirely *before* '2' (i.e., `end_index < position_of_2`).
        ii. If it is before '2', check if shifting right is possible (i.e., `end_index + 1` is less than the sequence length, 12). If possible, modify the *output sequence* by first setting the element at `start_index` to 0, and then copying the original block's values (from `input[start_index : end_index + 1]`) into the output sequence starting at index `start_index + 1`.
        iii. Determine if the block is located entirely *after* '2' (i.e., `start_index > position_of_2`).
        iv. If it is after '2', check if shifting left is possible (i.e., `start_index - 1` is greater than or equal to 0). If possible, modify the *output sequence* by first setting the element at `end_index` to 0, and then copying the original block's values (from `input[start_index : end_index + 1]`) into the output sequence starting at index `start_index - 1`.
5.  After processing all blocks, return the final modified output sequence.
