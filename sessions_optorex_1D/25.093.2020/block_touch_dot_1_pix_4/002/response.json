            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified a pattern involving a `0` followed by a non-zero digit in the examples where the input and output differed (train_6 and train_7). However, the proposed transformation rule (swapping the `0` with its left neighbor) did not accurately predict the output for train_6. The error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicate an issue with how the test harness calls the function (passing a NumPy array instead of a string), but this doesn't invalidate the need to reassess the transformation logic itself based on the expected outputs.\n\nThe key insight comes from re-examining train_6 and train_7. The transformation isn't a simple adjacent swap. Instead, it appears to involve moving the *first* `0` that is followed by a non-zero digit *leftwards*, past any immediately preceding block of non-zero digits.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the pattern identification: Find the index `i` of the first `0` where the element at `i+1` is non-zero.\n2.  Define the movement rule: If such an `i` exists and is preceded by one or more non-zero elements, determine the start index `j` of the contiguous block of non-zero elements ending at `i-1`. Move the element originally at index `i` (the `0`) to index `j`. This effectively shifts the non-zero block `[j...i-1]` one position to the right.\n3.  Validate this revised rule against all training examples.\n\n## Metrics\n\nLet's apply the *revised* logic (move the first `0` followed by a non-zero left past the preceding non-zero block) to each training case manually to confirm the hypothesis before generating code.\n\n"

            "text": "**Analysis of Metrics:**\n\nThe revised logic successfully explains train_7 but *fails* for train_6.\n\n*   **train_6 Input:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2]`\n*   First `0` followed by non-zero: at `i=5` (`0, 9`).\n*   Element at `i-1` (index 4) is `0`.\n*   Revised logic condition `sequence[target_i - 1] == 0` is TRUE.\n*   Therefore, the logic returns the sequence unchanged: `0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 2`.\n*   **Expected Output:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 2`\n*   **Mismatch Cause:** The rule triggered on the first `0, Y` pattern (`0, 9` at i=5), but because the element to its left was also `0`, no move occurred. However, the *actual* transformation seems related to the *second* `0, Y` pattern (`0, 2` at i=10).\n\n**Third Hypothesis:**\n\nMaybe the rule applies to the *first* `0, Y` pattern *only if* the element to the left of the `0` is non-zero? If the element to the left is zero, perhaps we should look for the *next* `0, Y` pattern?\n\nLet's test this \"skip if left neighbor is 0\" idea:\n\n1.  Scan for `i` where `seq[i]==0` and `seq[i+1]!=0`.\n2.  If found at index `i`:\n    *   Check `seq[i-1]`.\n    *   If `i==0` or `seq[i-1]==0`, *continue scanning* from `i+1` for the next occurrence.\n    *   If `seq[i-1]!=0`, then this is our target `i`. Find the start `j` of the non-zero block `[j...i-1]`. Move `seq[i]` to position `j`. Stop.\n3.  If no suitable `i` is found after scanning the whole sequence, return the original sequence.\n\nApplying the Third Hypothesis:\n\n*   `train_1`: `[0, 3, ...]`. Pattern at `i=0`. `i==0` is true. Continue scan. No more patterns. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_2`: `[..., 0, 6, ...]`. Pattern at `i=4`. `seq[i-1]` (index 3) is `0`. Continue scan. No more patterns. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_3`: No pattern. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_4`: No pattern. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_5`: `[..., 0, 2, ...]`. Pattern at `i=2`. `seq[i-1]` (index 1) is `0`. Continue scan. No more patterns. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_6`: `[..., 0, 9, ...]`. Pattern at `i=5`. `seq[i-1]` (index 4) is `0`. Continue scan from `i+1`.\n    *   Next pattern: `[..., 0, 2]` at `i=10`. `seq[i-1]` (index 9) is `0`. Continue scan from `i+1`.\n    *   No more patterns. Output unchanged? Still doesn't match expected `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 2`.\n\n**Fourth Hypothesis (Revisiting Train_6):**\n\nInput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2]`\nOutput: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2]`\n\nThe `0` at index `10` moves to index `6`.\nThe `0` at index `5` stays put.\nThe `9`s at `6, 7, 8` shift to `7, 8, 9`.\n\nWhat triggers the move of the `0` at index 10? It's followed by `2` (non-zero).\nWhat block does it move past? The `[9, 9, 9]` block.\nWhere does it land? Just before that block.\n\nMaybe the rule is simpler: Find *all* indices `i` such that `seq[i]==0` and `seq[i+1]!=0`. For the *first* such `i` where `seq[i-1]!=0` (and `i>0`), perform the move operation (move `seq[i]` left past the preceding non-zero block `[j...i-1]`). Only perform one such move.\n\nLet's try Hypothesis 4:\n\n1.  Find all candidate indices `i` where `seq[i]==0` and `seq[i+1]!=0`.\n2.  Filter this list to keep only those `i` where `i>0` and `seq[i-1]!=0`.\n3.  If the filtered list is empty, make no changes.\n4.  If the filtered list is not empty, take the *smallest* index `i` from it.\n5.  Find the start `j` of the non-zero block ending at `i-1`.\n6.  Move the element `seq[i]` (the zero) to position `j`.\n\nApplying Hypothesis 4:\n\n*   `train_1`: `[0, 3, ...]`. Candidate `i=0`. Filter: `i>0` is false. Filtered list empty. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_2`: `[..., 0, 6, ...]`. Candidate `i=4`. Filter: `seq[i-1]` (index 3) is `0`. Filtered list empty. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_3`: No candidates. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_4`: No candidates. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_5`: `[..., 0, 2, ...]`. Candidate `i=2`. Filter: `seq[i-1]` (index 1) is `0`. Filtered list empty. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_6`: `[..., 0, 9, ...], [..., 0, 2]`. Candidates `i=5`, `i=10`.\n    *   Filter `i=5`: `seq[i-1]` (index 4) is `0`. Discard.\n    *   Filter `i=10`: `seq[i-1]` (index 9) is `0`. Discard.\n    *   Filtered list empty. No change? Still doesn't match `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 2`.\n\n**Fifth Hypothesis (Focusing on the Moved Zero):**\n\nIn train_6, the `0` at index 10 moves. In train_7, the `0` at index 1 moves.\nWhat is special about these specific zeros?\n\n*   Train_6: `0` at index 10. It is preceded by `0` (index 9) and followed by `2`.\n*   Train_7: `0` at index 1. It is preceded by `4` and followed by `2`.\n\nThe commonality is that they are followed by a non-zero number.\nThe difference is what precedes them.\n\nLet's reconsider the *movement*:\n*   Train_6: `0` at 10 moves past `[9, 9, 9]` (indices 6, 7, 8) to land at index 6.\n*   Train_7: `0` at 1 moves past `[4]` (index 0) to land at index 0.\n\nThe rule seems to be:\n1.  Find the **first** index `i` such that `seq[i] == 0` and `seq[i+1] != 0`.\n2.  If no such `i` exists, stop.\n3.  Look at the element `seq[i-1]` (if `i > 0`).\n4.  **If `i == 0` OR `seq[i-1] == 0`**: Do nothing with this specific `i`. *Continue searching* for the next `i` starting from `i+1`. (This seems wrong based on train_7).\n\nLet's go back to the **Second Hypothesis** logic (the one implemented in the `tool_code` block) and see why it failed train_6.\n\n*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2]`\n*   Code finds `target_i = 5` (the first `0` followed by non-zero `9`).\n*   Code checks `if target_i == 0 or sequence[target_i - 1] == 0`: `5 > 0` is true, `sequence[4] == 0` is true. The OR condition is met.\n*   Code returns the original sequence. **This matches the code output.**\n\nThe code *correctly implemented* the second hypothesis. The second hypothesis was *wrong* because it didn't match the *expected output* for train_6.\n\nLet's look at the expected output for train_6 again: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 2`\nInput was: `0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 2`\n\nThe only difference is the `0` at index 10 moved to index 6.\n\nWhat if the rule applies to the *last* such `0`?\nHypothesis 6: Find the **last** index `i` such that `seq[i] == 0` and `seq[i+1] != 0`. If found, and if `i > 0` and `seq[i-1] != 0`, move `seq[i]` to the position `j` just before the start of the preceding non-zero block `[j...i-1]`.\n\n*   `train_1`: Last `0, Y` is `0, 3` at `i=0`. `i>0` is false. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_2`: Last `0, Y` is `0, 6` at `i=4`. `seq[i-1]` (index 3) is `0`. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_3`: No `0, Y`. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_4`: No `0, Y`. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_5`: Last `0, Y` is `0, 2` at `i=2`. `seq[i-1]` (index 1) is `0`. No change. **Match.**\n*   `train_6`: Last `0, Y` is `0, 2` at `i=10`. `seq[i-1]` (index 9) is `0`. No change? **Still fails.**\n\nLet's simplify. What actually happens?\nA specific `0` moves left past a block of non-zeros.\nWhich `0`? The one that allows the move.\nWhich move? Leftwards past the *first* block of non-zeros to its left.\n\nHypothesis 7:\n1. Iterate through the sequence from left to right (index `i`).\n2. If `seq[i] == 0` and `i+1 < len(seq)` and `seq[i+1] != 0`: This `0` is a potential candidate to move.\n3. Look left from `i-1`. Find the first non-zero element, say at index `k`.\n4. If no non-zero element is found to the left (i.e., all elements `0..i-1` are `0`, or `i=0`), this candidate `0` cannot move. Continue to the next `i`.\n5. If a non-zero element is found at `k`, find the start `j` of the contiguous block of non-zeros ending at `k` (this block might just be `seq[k]`). The block is `[j...k]`. Note: `k` must be `i-1` for this to be the *immediately* preceding block.\n6. If `k == i-1` (meaning `seq[i-1]` is non-zero), then this `0` at index `i` is the one to move. Find the start `j` of the non-zero block `[j...i-1]`. Move the `0` from `i` to `j`. **Stop the whole process.**\n7. If `k < i-1` (meaning `seq[i-1]` is `0`), this candidate `0` cannot move past the immediately preceding element. Continue to the next `i`.\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 7:\n\n*   `train_1`: `i=0`. `seq[0]=0`, `seq[1]=3`. Condition met. Look left: `i=0`, no non-zeros left. Cannot move. Continue. No more candidates. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_2`: `i=4`. `seq[4]=0`, `seq[5]=6`. Condition met. Look left: `seq[3]=0`. Cannot move. Continue. No more candidates. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_3`: No candidates. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_4`: No candidates. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_5`: `i=2`. `seq[2]=0`, `seq[3]=2`. Condition met. Look left: `seq[1]=0`. Cannot move. Continue. No more candidates. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_6`:\n    *   `i=5`. `seq[5]=0`, `seq[6]=9`. Condition met. Look left: `seq[4]=0`. Cannot move. Continue.\n    *   `i=10`. `seq[10]=0`, `seq[11]=2`. Condition met. Look left: `seq[9]=0`. Cannot move. Continue.\n    *   No more candidates. Output unchanged? **Still fails.**\n\nThis is perplexing. Let's reconsider the actual change in train_6:\nInput:  `idx: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11`\n        `val: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2`\nOutput: `val: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 2`\n\nThe `0` at index `10` moved to index `6`. The block `9, 9, 9` (originally at 6, 7, 8) shifted to 7, 8, 9. The `0` at index `9` stayed put relative to the `9`s block.\n\nWhat is unique about index 6? It's the start of the non-zero block `[9, 9, 9]`.\nWhat is unique about the `0` at index 10? It's the first `0` *after* the block `[9, 9, 9]` which is also followed by a non-zero number (`2`).\n\nHypothesis 8:\n1. Scan the sequence to find the **first** contiguous block of one or more non-zero numbers. Let its start index be `j` and end index be `k`.\n2. If no such block exists, stop.\n3. Scan the sequence *starting from index `k+1`*. Find the **first** index `i` such that `seq[i] == 0` and `i+1 < len(seq)` and `seq[i+1] != 0`.\n4. If no such index `i` is found after the block, stop.\n5. If found, move the element `seq[i]` (the zero) to position `j` (the start of the non-zero block found in step 1).\n6. Stop the process (only one move occurs).\n\nLet's test Hypothesis 8:\n\n*   `train_1`: `[0, 3, 3, ..., 2, 0, 0]`. First non-zero block `[3, 3, ..., 2]` starts at `j=1`, ends at `k=9`. Scan from `k+1=10`. `seq[10]=0`, `seq[11]=0`. No `0` followed by non-zero found after the block. Stop. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_2`: `[0, ..., 0, 6, 6, 2, 0, ...]`. First non-zero block `[6, 6, 2]` starts at `j=5`, ends at `k=7$. Scan from `k+1=8`. `seq[8]=0`, `seq[9]=0`. `seq[10]=0`, `seq[11]=0`. No `0` followed by non-zero found after the block. Stop. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_3`: `[2, 3, ..., 3, 0, ...]`. First non-zero block `[2, 3, ..., 3]` starts at `j=0`, ends at `k=6`. Scan from `k+1=7$. `seq[7]=0`, `seq[8]=0`, etc. No `0` followed by non-zero found after the block. Stop. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_4`: `[5, ..., 5, 2, 0]`. First non-zero block `[5, ..., 5, 2]` starts `j=0`, ends `k=10$. Scan from `k+1=11`. `seq[11]=0`. End of sequence. No `0` followed by non-zero found after the block. Stop. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_5`: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 4, ..., 4, 0, ...]`. First non-zero block `[2, 4, ..., 4]` starts `j=3`, ends `k=8`. Scan from `k+1=9$. `seq[9]=0`, `seq[10]=0`, `seq[11]=0`. No `0` followed by non-zero found after the block. Stop. Output unchanged. **Match.**\n*   `train_6`: `[0, ..., 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2]`. First non-zero block `[9, 9, 9]` starts `j=6`, ends `k=8`. Scan from `k+1=9`.\n    *   `seq[9]=0`, `seq[10]=0`.\n    *   `seq[10]=0`, `seq[11]=2`. Found candidate `i=10`.\n    *   Move `seq[10]` (the 0) to position `j=6`.\n    *   Sequence becomes `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, (moved 0), 9, 9, 9, 0, 2]`.\n    *   Stop. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 2`. **Match!**\n*   `train_7`: `[4, 0, 2, 0, ...]`. First non-zero block `[4]` starts `j=0`, ends `k=0`. Scan from `k+1=1$.\n    *   `seq[1]=0`, `seq[2]=2`. Found candidate `i=1`.\n    *   Move `seq[1]` (the 0) to position `j=0$.\n    *   Sequence becomes `[(moved 0), 4, 2, 0, ...]`.\n    *   Stop. Output: `0 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. **Match!**\n\nThis hypothesis seems to correctly explain all examples.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
