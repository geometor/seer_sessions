objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The input and output data structures, representing a sequence of digits.
  - name: element
    type: integer
    description: Individual numbers within the sequence.
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: list of integers
    description: A contiguous subsequence containing only non-zero elements.
    properties:
      - name: start_index
        type: integer
      - name: end_index
        type: integer
properties:
  - object: element
    name: value
    type: integer
    description: The numerical value (0-9).
  - object: element
    name: index
    type: integer
    description: The position within the sequence (0-based).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Elements have left/right neighbors based on index.
  - type: location
    description: An element can be located before, within, or after a non_zero_block.
actions:
  - name: find_first_non_zero_block
    description: Scan the sequence from left to right to find the first contiguous subsequence of non-zero elements. Record its start and end indices.
    condition: A non-zero element must exist in the sequence.
  - name: find_first_zero_followed_by_non_zero_after_block
    description: Starting from the position immediately after the found non_zero_block, scan the rest of the sequence to find the first index `i` where `sequence[i]` is 0 and `sequence[i+1]` is non-zero.
    condition: Requires a non_zero_block to have been found first, and the pattern '0, non-zero' must exist after it.
  - name: move_element
    description: Remove an element from one index and insert it at another index, shifting intermediate elements. Specifically, move the zero found in the previous step to the start index of the non_zero_block.
    condition: Both the non_zero_block and the subsequent '0, non-zero' pattern must be found.
  - name: no_change
    description: The sequence remains unaltered.
    condition: Applicable if no non_zero_block is found, or if no '0, non-zero' pattern is found after the first non_zero_block.
