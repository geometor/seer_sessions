objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: The input and output data structures.
  - name: element
    type: integer
    description: Individual numbers within the sequence.
properties:
  - object: element
    name: value
    type: integer
    description: The numerical value of the element (0-9).
  - object: element
    name: index
    type: integer
    description: The position of the element within the sequence (zero-based).
  - object: element
    name: is_zero
    type: boolean
    description: True if the element's value is 0.
  - object: element
    name: is_non_zero
    type: boolean
    description: True if the element's value is not 0.
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Elements can be adjacent (left neighbor, right neighbor) within the sequence.
    properties:
      - element_1: index i
      - element_2: index i+1 (right neighbor)
      - element_3: index i-1 (left neighbor)
actions:
  - name: scan
    description: Iterate through the sequence elements from left to right.
  - name: find_pattern
    description: Locate the first index `i` where element `i` is 0 and element `i+1` is non-zero.
    condition: Requires checking pairs of adjacent elements.
  - name: swap
    description: Exchange the positions of two elements in the sequence.
    condition: Applicable if the pattern is found at index `i > 0`. Swaps elements at `i` and `i-1`.
  - name: no_change
    description: The sequence remains unaltered.
    condition: Applicable if the pattern is not found, or if the pattern is found at index `i = 0`.
