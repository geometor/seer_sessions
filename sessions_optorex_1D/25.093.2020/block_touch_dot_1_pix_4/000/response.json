It looks like a `0` that was immediately followed by a non-zero number (`9`) has moved one position to the left, swapping with its left neighbor (which was also `0`).\n    - In train_7: `4 0 2 ...` becomes `0 4 2 ...`. Here, a `0` that was immediately followed by a non-zero number (`2`) has moved one position to the left, swapping with its left neighbor (`4`).\n- The common pattern in the modified examples (train_6, train_7) seems to be locating the *first* instance of a `0` that is immediately followed by a non-zero digit. If such a `0` exists and it's not the very first element in the sequence, it swaps positions with the element immediately to its left.\n- In the examples where no change occurs (train_1 to train_5), either there is no `0` followed by a non-zero digit (train_3, train_4), or the first such `0` is already at the beginning of the sequence (train_1), or swapping it with its left neighbor results in no visible change because the neighbor is also `0` (train_2, train_5).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
