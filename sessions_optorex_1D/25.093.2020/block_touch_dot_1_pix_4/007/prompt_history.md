## Perception

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length.
Observing the training examples:
- Most examples (train_1 to train_5) show the output being identical to the input.
- train_6 and train_7 show a change.
    - In train_6: `... 0 0 9 ...` becomes `... 0 0 0 9 ...`. It looks like a `0` that was immediately followed by a non-zero number (`9`) has moved one position to the left, swapping with its left neighbor (which was also `0`).
    - In train_7: `4 0 2 ...` becomes `0 4 2 ...`. Here, a `0` that was immediately followed by a non-zero number (`2`) has moved one position to the left, swapping with its left neighbor (`4`).
- The common pattern in the modified examples (train_6, train_7) seems to be locating the *first* instance of a `0` that is immediately followed by a non-zero digit. If such a `0` exists and it's not the very first element in the sequence, it swaps positions with the element immediately to its left.
- In the examples where no change occurs (train_1 to train_5), either there is no `0` followed by a non-zero digit (train_3, train_4), or the first such `0` is already at the beginning of the sequence (train_1), or swapping it with its left neighbor results in no visible change because the neighbor is also `0` (train_2, train_5).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through the input sequence from the first element up to the second-to-last element. Let the current index be `i`.
2.  At each index `i`, check if the element at `i` is `0` AND the element at the next index `i+1` is non-zero.
3.  If this condition is met for the first time at index `i`:
    a.  Check if `i` is greater than 0 (i.e., the found `0` is not the very first element of the sequence).
    b.  If `i > 0`, swap the element at index `i` with the element at index `i-1`.
    c.  Stop iterating, as the transformation involves only the *first* occurrence of the pattern.
4.  If the condition in step 2 is never met, or if it's met only at index `i = 0`, make no changes to the sequence.
5.  Output the resulting sequence.
```python
import math

"""
Transforms a sequence of integers based on a specific pattern.

The rule is:
1. Find the first index `i` where the element `seq[i]` is 0 and the next element `seq[i+1]` is non-zero.
2. If such an index `i` is found and `i` is greater than 0 (not the first element), swap the element at index `i` (the zero) with the element at index `i-1` (its left neighbor).
3. Only the first occurrence of this pattern triggers the swap.
4. If the pattern is not found, or if it's found at index `i = 0`, the sequence remains unchanged.

## General Assessment

The primary issue appears to be a data parsing error within the testing environment, indicated by the `invalid literal for int() with base 10:` errors. The `parse_input` function in the provided `code_00.py` expects individual numeric strings after splitting the input string, but it seems to be receiving the entire input string (e.g., "0 3 3 ...") at once. This prevents the core transformation logic from being executed and tested.

However, analyzing the transformation logic described in the docstring and implemented in `code_00.py` against the input/output pairs suggests this logic correctly handles all provided training examples. The logic involves:
1.  Identifying the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers.
2.  Searching for the first occurrence of a `0` immediately followed by a non-zero number *after* this block.
3.  If both are found, moving the identified `0` to the starting position of the non-zero block.

The strategy is to:
1.  Assume the parsing error is an artifact of the testing setup and that the `transform` function would receive correctly parsed data (e.g., a list of integers).
2.  Verify the existing logic from `code_00.py` against all examples.
3.  Generate metrics based on this logic.
4.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately describe this verified logic.

## Metrics Gathering

Based on the logic in `code_00.py`: Find the first non-zero block (`block_start`, `block_end`), then find the first `0` followed by non-zero (`pattern_idx`) at or after `block_end + 1`. If `pattern_idx` is found, move the `0` at `pattern_idx` to `block_start`.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify First Non-Zero Block:** Scan the input sequence from left to right. Find the starting index (`block_start`) and ending index (`block_end`) of the first contiguous sequence of one or more non-zero numbers.
2.  **Handle No Block Case:** If no non-zero numbers are found in the sequence (i.e., `block_start` remains invalid), make no changes and output the original sequence.
3.  **Search for Pattern After Block:** If a non-zero block was found, start scanning the sequence again from the position immediately *after* the block ends (i.e., from index `block_end + 1`). Search for the first occurrence of the pattern where an element is `0` and the element immediately following it is non-zero. Let the index of this `0` be `pattern_index`.
4.  **Handle No Pattern Case:** If the pattern described in step 3 is not found in the portion of the sequence after the block, make no changes and output the original sequence.
5.  **Perform Move Operation:** If both the non-zero block (step 1) and the subsequent pattern (step 3) were found:
    a.  Remove the `0` element located at `pattern_index`.
    b.  Insert this `0` element back into the sequence at the `block_start` index. (This effectively shifts the original non-zero block and any intervening elements one position to the right).
6.  **Output:** Output the modified sequence.
