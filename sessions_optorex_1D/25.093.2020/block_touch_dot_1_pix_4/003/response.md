"""
Transforms a sequence of integers based on the following rule:
1. Find the first contiguous block of one or more non-zero numbers in the sequence.
2. If no such block exists, the sequence remains unchanged.
3. If a block is found (starting at `start_index`, ending at `end_index`), search the sequence *after* this block (from index `end_index + 1` onwards).
4. Find the first index `i` in this subsequent part where the element `sequence[i]` is 0 and the next element `sequence[i+1]` is non-zero.
5. If no such index `i` is found after the block, the sequence remains unchanged.
6. If such an index `i` is found, move the element `sequence[i]` (the zero) to the `start_index` of the non-zero block found in step 1. The elements originally from `start_index` to `i-1` are shifted one position to the right.
7. Only the first non-zero block and the first qualifying zero after it trigger the transformation.
