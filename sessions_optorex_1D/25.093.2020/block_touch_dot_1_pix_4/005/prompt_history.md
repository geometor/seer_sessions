## Perception

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length.
Observing the training examples:
- Most examples (train_1 to train_5) show the output being identical to the input.
- train_6 and train_7 show a change.
    - In train_6: `... 0 0 9 ...` becomes `... 0 0 0 9 ...`. It looks like a `0` that was immediately followed by a non-zero number (`9`) has moved one position to the left, swapping with its left neighbor (which was also `0`).
    - In train_7: `4 0 2 ...` becomes `0 4 2 ...`. Here, a `0` that was immediately followed by a non-zero number (`2`) has moved one position to the left, swapping with its left neighbor (`4`).
- The common pattern in the modified examples (train_6, train_7) seems to be locating the *first* instance of a `0` that is immediately followed by a non-zero digit. If such a `0` exists and it's not the very first element in the sequence, it swaps positions with the element immediately to its left.
- In the examples where no change occurs (train_1 to train_5), either there is no `0` followed by a non-zero digit (train_3, train_4), or the first such `0` is already at the beginning of the sequence (train_1), or swapping it with its left neighbor results in no visible change because the neighbor is also `0` (train_2, train_5).

## Natural Language Program

1.  Iterate through the input sequence from the first element up to the second-to-last element. Let the current index be `i`.
2.  At each index `i`, check if the element at `i` is `0` AND the element at the next index `i+1` is non-zero.
3.  If this condition is met for the first time at index `i`:
    a.  Check if `i` is greater than 0 (i.e., the found `0` is not the very first element of the sequence).
    b.  If `i > 0`, swap the element at index `i` with the element at index `i-1`.
    c.  Stop iterating, as the transformation involves only the *first* occurrence of the pattern.
4.  If the condition in step 2 is never met, or if it's met only at index `i = 0`, make no changes to the sequence.
5.  Output the resulting sequence.

## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed universally due to a fundamental error in parsing the input strings. The `parse_input` function was incorrectly trying to convert the entire space-separated string into a single integer, rather than splitting it into a list of integers. Consequently, the core transformation logic, although present in the code, was never actually executed or tested against the examples.

The strategy is:
1.  **Correct Input Parsing**: Modify the `parse_input` function to correctly handle space-separated integer strings, likely using `input_str.split()` and mapping the results to `int`.
2.  **Re-evaluate Transformation Logic**: The natural language program and the code provided in the previous attempt actually described a more complex logic than the initial "swap" perception. This logic involved finding the first non-zero block and then finding the first `0` followed by a non-zero *after* that block, moving this `0` to the start of the block. This more complex logic correctly explains the transformations in examples `train_6` and `train_7`, as well as the lack of change in the others.
3.  **Refine Documentation**: Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on this confirmed "block-based move" logic.

**Summary:**
- All sequences have the same length before and after transformation.
- Change occurs only when a specific pattern (`0` followed by non-zero) exists *after* the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers.
- The transformation involves moving the identified `0` to the start position of that first non-zero block.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Identify First Non-Zero Block**: Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the first element that is not zero. This marks the `start_index` of the first contiguous block of non-zero numbers. Continue scanning until a zero is encountered or the sequence ends; the index of the last non-zero element in this block is the `end_index`.
2.  **Handle No Block Case**: If no non-zero elements are found in the sequence (i.e., no block exists), the sequence remains unchanged. Output the original sequence.
3.  **Search for Pattern After Block**: Starting from the element immediately after the identified block (`end_index + 1`), scan the rest of the sequence up to the second-to-last element. Find the first index `i` such that the element at `i` is `0` and the element at `i+1` is non-zero.
4.  **Handle No Pattern Case**: If no such index `i` is found after the block, the sequence remains unchanged. Output the original sequence.
5.  **Perform Move Operation**: If both the block and the pattern (`0` at index `i`) are found:
    a.  Temporarily store the value `0` from index `i`.
    b.  Remove the element at index `i` from the sequence. (Elements from `i+1` onwards shift left).
    c.  Insert the stored `0` value into the sequence at the `start_index` identified in Step 1. (Elements from the original `start_index` onwards shift right).
6.  **Output Result**: Output the modified sequence.
