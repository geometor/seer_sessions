"""
Transforms a sequence of integers based on a specific pattern.

The rule is:
1. Find the first index `i` where the element `seq[i]` is 0 and the next element `seq[i+1]` is non-zero.
2. If such an index `i` is found and `i` is greater than 0 (not the first element), swap the element at index `i` (the zero) with the element at index `i-1` (its left neighbor).
3. Only the first occurrence of this pattern triggers the swap.
4. If the pattern is not found, or if it's found at index `i = 0`, the sequence remains unchanged.
