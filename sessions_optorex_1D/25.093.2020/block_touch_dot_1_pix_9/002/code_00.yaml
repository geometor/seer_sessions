Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: List[Integer] or numpy.ndarray # Adjusted based on error
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: Integer values
  - name: Element
    type: Integer
    properties:
      - value
      - position (index)

Identified_Values:
  - trigger_value: 0
  - condition_value: 2

Key_Indices:
  - name: penultimate
    value: n-2  # where n is sequence length (10 for n=12)
  - name: ultimate
    value: n-1  # (11 for n=12)
  - name: antepenultimate
    value: n-3  # (9 for n=12)

Conditions_Actions:
  - condition:
      description: Penultimate element is 0 and ultimate element is 2.
      check: Sequence[n-2] == 0 and Sequence[n-1] == 2
    action:
      name: Move_To_Start
      description: Remove the element 0 from index n-2 and insert it at index 0.
      modifies: Sequence

  - condition:
      description: Antepenultimate element is 2 and penultimate element is 0.
      check: Sequence[n-3] == 2 and Sequence[n-2] == 0
    action:
      name: Move_To_End
      description: Remove the element 0 from index n-2 and append it to the end of the sequence.
      modifies: Sequence

  - condition:
      description: Neither of the above conditions is met.
      check: Not (Condition 1 or Condition 2)
    action:
      name: No_Change
      description: The sequence remains unchanged.
