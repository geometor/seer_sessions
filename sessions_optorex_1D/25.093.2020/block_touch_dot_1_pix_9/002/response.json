            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code failed execution on all examples due to a type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str`) and parse it into a list of integers using `_parse_input`. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` indicates that the function was actually called with a NumPy array as input during testing.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input, removing the need for string parsing (`_parse_input`).\n2.  **Adapt Output Handling:** Ensure the function returns the data in the expected format for the testing environment (likely a list or NumPy array, rather than the formatted string produced by `_format_output`).\n3.  **Verify Logic:** Confirm that the core transformation logic identified (moving a '0' based on adjacent '2's near the end) correctly handles all provided training examples, assuming the input is correctly processed as a sequence of integers.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe code execution failed before the core logic could be tested due to the input type error. Therefore, the analysis focuses on re-validating the intended logic against the examples, assuming the input is correctly handled as a sequence of integers.\n\n*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` based on the error. Expected type by the initial code: `str`.\n*   **Output Type:** Assumed to be required as `numpy.ndarray` or `List[int]`. Produced by the initial code: `str`.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 in all examples.\n*   **Transformation Trigger:** The presence of a `0` at index 10 (penultimate position) combined with a `2` at either index 9 (antepenultimate) or index 11 (ultimate).\n\n**Example Breakdown (Re-validation of Logic):**\n\n1.  **train_1:** Input `[4 ... 4 0 2]`. Condition `seq[10]==0 and seq[11]==2` is TRUE. Action: Move `0` from index 10 to 0. Output: `[0 4 ... 4 2]`. Correct.\n2.  **train_2:** Input `[0 ... 2 0 8]`. Condition `seq[9]==2 and seq[10]==0` is TRUE. Action: Move `0` from index 10 to 11. Output: `[0 ... 2 8 0]`. Correct.\n3.  **train_3:** Input `[0 ... 2 9 9]`. Neither condition met. Output matches input. Correct.\n4.  **train_4:** Input `[2 1 ... 1 1]`. Neither condition met. Output matches input. Correct.\n5.  **train_5:** Input `[9 ... 9 9 2]`. Neither condition met. Output matches input. Correct.\n6.  **train_6:** Input `[0 ... 2 6 6 6 0 0 0]`. Neither condition met (index 10 is 0, but index 9 is not 2, and index 11 is not 2). Output matches input. Correct.\n7.  **train_7:** Input `[0 ... 0 0 2 6 6 6]`. Neither condition met. Output matches input. Correct.\n\nThe core logic appears sound and covers all examples. The primary issue is adapting the function signature and input/output handling.\n\n## Updated YAML Facts\n\n"
