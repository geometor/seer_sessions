Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** All example sequences have a fixed length of 12 integers.
3.  **Key Values:** The numbers `0` and `2` appear to play a crucial role in triggering the transformation. Other numbers (`1`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `9`) seem to act as context or passive elements.
4.  **Conditional Transformation:** The transformation does not always occur. Examples 3 through 7 show the output being identical to the input. This suggests the transformation is conditional.
5.  **Positional Importance:** The changes observed in `train_1` and `train_2` involve the number `0` located specifically at the second-to-last position (index 10, assuming 0-based indexing for a length 12 list). The value of the element immediately preceding or succeeding this `0` determines the outcome.
6.  **Specific Actions:**
    *   In `train_1`, a `0` at index 10 followed by a `2` at index 11 results in the `0` moving to the beginning of the sequence (index 0).
    *   In `train_2`, a `2` at index 9 followed by a `0` at index 10 results in the `0` moving to the end of the sequence (index 11).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: List[Integer]
    properties:
      - length: 12
  - name: Element
    type: Integer
    properties:
      - value
      - position (index)

Identified_Numbers:
  - trigger_value_1: 0
  - trigger_value_2: 2

Key_Positions:
  - name: penultimate
    index: n-2  # where n is sequence length (10 for n=12)
  - name: ultimate
    index: n-1  # (11 for n=12)
  - name: antepenultimate
    index: n-3  # (9 for n=12)

Actions:
  - name: Check_Condition_1
    description: Verify if the penultimate element is 0 and the ultimate element is 2.
    inputs:
      - Sequence[penultimate]
      - Sequence[ultimate]
    condition: Sequence[penultimate] == 0 and Sequence[ultimate] == 2
  - name: Check_Condition_2
    description: Verify if the antepenultimate element is 2 and the penultimate element is 0.
    inputs:
      - Sequence[antepenultimate]
      - Sequence[penultimate]
    condition: Sequence[antepenultimate] == 2 and Sequence[penultimate] == 0
  - name: Move_To_Start
    description: Remove the penultimate element (0) and insert it at the beginning (index 0).
    target: Element at penultimate position
  - name: Move_To_End
    description: Remove the penultimate element (0) and append it to the end.
    target: Element at penultimate position
  - name: No_Change
    description: Keep the sequence as is.

Relationships:
  - Condition_1 triggers Move_To_Start.
  - Condition_2 triggers Move_To_End.
  - If neither Condition_1 nor Condition_2 is met, No_Change occurs.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Let `n` be the length of the sequence (which is 12).
3.  Check the value of the element at index `n-2` (the second-to-last element) and the element at index `n-1` (the last element).
4.  **If** the element at index `n-2` is `0` AND the element at index `n-1` is `2`:
    *   Remove the `0` from index `n-2`.
    *   Insert this `0` at the beginning of the sequence (index 0).
    *   The resulting sequence is the output.
5.  **Else**, check the value of the element at index `n-3` (the third-to-last element) and the element at index `n-2` (the second-to-last element).
6.  **If** the element at index `n-3` is `2` AND the element at index `n-2` is `0`:
    *   Remove the `0` from index `n-2`.
    *   Append this `0` to the very end of the sequence.
    *   The resulting sequence is the output.
7.  **Otherwise** (if neither of the above conditions is met):
    *   The output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
```python
"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 integers based on specific patterns involving the numbers 0 and 2 near the end of the sequence.

1. If the second-to-last element is 0 and the last element is 2, move the 0 from the second-to-last position to the beginning of the sequence.
2. If the third-to-last element is 2 and the second-to-last element is 0, move the 0 from the second-to-last position to the end of the sequence.
3. Otherwise, the sequence remains unchanged.
