Other numbers (`1`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `9`) seem to act as context or passive elements.\n4.  **Conditional Transformation:** The transformation does not always occur. Examples 3 through 7 show the output being identical to the input. This suggests the transformation is conditional.\n5.  **Positional Importance:** The changes observed in `train_1` and `train_2` involve the number `0` located specifically at the second-to-last position (index 10, assuming 0-based indexing for a length 12 list). The value of the element immediately preceding or succeeding this `0` determines the outcome.\n6.  **Specific Actions:**\n    *   In `train_1`, a `0` at index 10 followed by a `2` at index 11 results in the `0` moving to the beginning of the sequence (index 0).\n    *   In `train_2`, a `2` at index 9 followed by a `0` at index 10 results in the `0` moving to the end of the sequence (index 11).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
