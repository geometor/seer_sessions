            "text": "Okay, let's break down the task.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single strings representing sequences of 12 digits.\n2.  **Digits:** The sequences contain digits from 0 to 9.\n3.  **Special Digit '2':** The digit '2' appears exactly once in every input and output sequence. Its position seems crucial.\n4.  **Zeroes ('0'):** The digit '0' appears multiple times and seems to act as a background or empty space.\n5.  **Other Non-Zero Digits (1, 6, 9):** These digits appear, sometimes contiguously, forming blocks.\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves shifting a contiguous block of non-zero digits (excluding '2') either one step left or one step right. The digit '2' remains stationary. A '0' swaps position with the shifting block.\n7.  **Shift Direction:** The direction of the shift depends on the block's position relative to the '2'. Blocks to the left of '2' shift right; blocks to the right of '2' shift left.\n8.  **Zero Swap:** When a block shifts, it swaps places with an adjacent '0'. If shifting right, it swaps with the '0' immediately to its right. If shifting left, it swaps with the '0' immediately to its left.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
