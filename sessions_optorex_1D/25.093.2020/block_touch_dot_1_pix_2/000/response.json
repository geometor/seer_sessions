The length of the sequence appears constant (12 elements in all examples).\n2.  **Key Element:** The number `2` seems to act as a crucial marker or pivot point within the sequence. Its presence and position influence the transformation.\n3.  **Role of Zero (`0`):** Zeros appear to interact with adjacent non-zero numbers, triggering shifts.\n4.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation involves rearranging elements within a specific sub-sequence (segment). The rearrangement resembles a cyclic shift (either left or right).\n5.  **Transformation Trigger & Location:**\n    *   A transformation seems to occur if there's a zero adjacent to a block of non-zero numbers, either immediately before or immediately after the position of the `2`.\n    *   If the pattern `[non-zero block, 0]` occurs *before* the `2`, a *right* cyclic shift happens involving the block and the zero.\n    *   If the pattern `[0, non-zero block]` occurs *after* the `2`, a *left* cyclic shift happens involving the zero and the block.\n6.  **Segment Identification:** The segment involved in the shift consists of the triggering zero and the adjacent contiguous block of non-zero numbers.\n7.  **Priority:** The examples suggest only one shift occurs per sequence. The logic seems to prioritize checking for the condition before the `2` first, and only if that doesn't trigger a shift, it checks for the condition after the `2`.\n8.  **No Change Condition:** If the number `2` is absent, or if neither the \"before `2`\" nor the \"after `2`\" conditions for a shift are met, the input"
