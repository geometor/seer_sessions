## General Assessment and Strategy

The primary issue identified is an input type mismatch: the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, while the testing environment provided NumPy arrays. This caused the `split()` method error. The core transformation logic, however, seems partially correct but needs refinement based on a closer look at the examples.

The initial hypothesis about the shift being triggered *immediately* next to the pivot `2` was too restrictive. Examples 1, 3, and 6 show that the relevant pattern (`[non-zero block, 0]` before `2` or `[0, non-zero block]` after `2`) can occur anywhere in the respective sections (before/after `2`), and the *first* such occurrence dictates the shift.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or array of integers directly, removing the `input_str.split()` logic.
2.  **Refine Pattern Finding:** Adjust the logic to search for the *first* occurrence of the relevant pattern (`[block, 0]` before `2` or `[0, block]` after `2`) within the sequence segments defined by the pivot `2`.
3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Reflect the corrected input type and the refined pattern-finding and shifting logic.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept an input sequence (list) of integers.
2.  Find the index of the first occurrence of the integer `2` (the pivot) in the sequence. If `2` is not present, return the original sequence unchanged.
3.  Search the portion of the sequence *before* the pivot's index (from left to right) for the *first* occurrence of a sub-sequence consisting of a contiguous block of one or more non-zero integers immediately followed by a single `0`.
4.  If such a pattern (`[non-zero block, 0]`) is found before the pivot:
    *   Identify the segment corresponding to this pattern (the block and the trailing zero).
    *   Perform a *right cyclic shift* on only this segment within the main sequence (move the trailing `0` to the beginning of the segment, shifting the block one position to the right).
    *   Return the modified sequence. No further checks are needed.
5.  If no such pattern was found *before* the pivot, search the portion of the sequence *after* the pivot's index (from left to right) for the *first* occurrence of a sub-sequence consisting of a single `0` immediately followed by a contiguous block of one or more non-zero integers.
6.  If such a pattern (`[0, non-zero block]`) is found after the pivot:
    *   Identify the segment corresponding to this pattern (the leading zero and the block).
    *   Perform a *left cyclic shift* on only this segment within the main sequence (move the leading `0` to the end of the segment, shifting the block one position to the left).
    *   Return the modified sequence.
7.  If neither the "before" pattern nor the "after" pattern was found, return the original sequence unchanged.
