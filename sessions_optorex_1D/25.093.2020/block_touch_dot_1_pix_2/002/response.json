            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe primary issue identified is an input type mismatch: the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, while the testing environment provided NumPy arrays. This caused the `split()` method error. The core transformation logic, however, seems partially correct but needs refinement based on a closer look at the examples.\n\nThe initial hypothesis about the shift being triggered *immediately* next to the pivot `2` was too restrictive. Examples 1, 3, and 6 show that the relevant pattern (`[non-zero block, 0]` before `2` or `[0, non-zero block]` after `2`) can occur anywhere in the respective sections (before/after `2`), and the *first* such occurrence dictates the shift.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or array of integers directly, removing the `input_str.split()` logic.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Finding:** Adjust the logic to search for the *first* occurrence of the relevant pattern (`[block, 0]` before `2` or `[0, block]` after `2`) within the sequence segments defined by the pivot `2`.\n3.  **Update Natural Language Program:** Reflect the corrected input type and the refined pattern-finding and shifting logic.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the refined understanding:\n\n| Example | Input                                        | Pivot (2) Index | Pattern Location | Pattern Found        | Segment Indices | Shift Type | Expected Output                              | Matches Refined Logic? |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------------- | :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------------- | :-------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |\n| 1       | `[0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,2,0]`                  | 10              | Before           | `[6,6], 0`           | 5-7             | Right      | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,2,0]`                  | Yes                    |\n| 2       | `[6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]`                  | 9               | Before           | `[6,6,6,6], 0`       | 0-4             | Right      | `[0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,2,0,0]`                  | Yes                    |\n| 3       | `[2,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]`                  | 0               | After            | `0, [3,3,...,3]`     | 1-10            | Left       | `[2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]`                  | Yes                    |\n| 4       | `[0,2,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]`                  | 1               | After            | `0, [7,7,...,7]`     | 2-9             | Left       | `[0,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0]`                  | Yes                    |\n| 5       | `[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2]`                  | 11              | Neither          | None                 | N/A             | None       | `[8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2]`                  | Yes                    |\n| 6       | `[0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]`                  | 1               | After            | `0, [5]`             | 6-7             | Left       | `[0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | Yes                    |\n| 7       | `[0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]`                  | 2               | Neither          | None                 | N/A             | None       | `[0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]`                  | Yes                    |\n\nThe refined logic correctly predicts the output for all training examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
