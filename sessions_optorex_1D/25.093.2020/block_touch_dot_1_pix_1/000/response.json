When the output changes, a '2' is always present in the input.\n*   The digit '0' is also crucial. The changes involve removing a '0' and appending a '0'.\n*   The transformation involves modifying the sequence structure: removing an element causes subsequent elements to shift left, and a new element ('0') is added at the end.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
