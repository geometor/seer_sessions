objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: Represents the input and output data.
  - name: digit_2
    type: integer
    value: 2
    description: Acts as a potential trigger or anchor point for the transformation.
  - name: digit_0
    type: integer
    value: 0
    description: Plays a key role in the condition and the transformation action (removal and appending).
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: integer
    value_constraint: '> 0'
    description: Used in the condition check following a '0'.

properties:
  - name: index
    applies_to: [sequence]
    description: The position of a digit within the sequence.
  - name: value
    applies_to: [sequence element]
    description: The integer value of a digit at a specific index.
  - name: length
    applies_to: [sequence]
    description: The number of digits in the sequence.
  - name: adjacency
    applies_to: [sequence element]
    description: The relationship between a digit and the digit immediately following it.

actions:
  - name: find_first
    actor: rule_logic
    target: digit_2
    result: index of digit_2 or indication of absence
    description: Locate the position of the first '2' in the sequence.
  - name: search_after
    actor: rule_logic
    target: sequence
    parameters: [start_index]
    description: Iterate through the sequence starting from a specific index.
  - name: check_condition
    actor: rule_logic
    condition: |
      Is the current digit '0'?
      Is it NOT the last digit in the sequence?
      Is the next digit non-zero?
    description: Evaluate if a specific '0' meets the criteria for removal.
  - name: remove_element
    actor: rule_logic
    target: sequence element
    parameters: [index]
    effect: Element at the specified index is removed, subsequent elements shift left.
    description: Delete a digit from the sequence.
  - name: append_element
    actor: rule_logic
    target: sequence
    parameters: [element_value]
    effect: Adds the specified element (always '0' in this task) to the end of the sequence.
    description: Add a '0' to the end.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    from: digit_0
    to: digit_2
    description: The condition applies to '0's that appear *after* the first '2'.
  - type: immediate_succession
    from: digit_0
    to: non_zero_digit
    description: The condition requires a '0' to be immediately followed by a non-zero digit.
