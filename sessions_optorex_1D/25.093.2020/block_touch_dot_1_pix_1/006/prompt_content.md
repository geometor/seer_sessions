"""
Find the index `i` of the *first* occurrence of the digit `2` in the sequence.
If `2` is not found, return the original input sequence unchanged.
If `2` is found at index `i`, proceed to search the subsequence starting from index `i + 1` up to the second-to-last element of the original sequence.
Iterate through this subsequence, checking each element at index `j` (where `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `length - 2`):
  a. Check if the element `sequence[j]` is equal to `0`.
  b. Check if the *next* element `sequence[j + 1]` is *not* equal to `0`.
  c. If both conditions (a and b) are met, this `0` at index `j` is the target. Record this index `j` as `target_index` and immediately stop this search iteration.
After completing the search:
  a. If a `target_index` was recorded:
     i. Create a new sequence by removing the element at `target_index` from the original sequence.
     ii. Append a `0` to the end of this new sequence.
     iii. Return the modified sequence.
  b. If no `target_index` was recorded: Return the original input sequence unchanged.
