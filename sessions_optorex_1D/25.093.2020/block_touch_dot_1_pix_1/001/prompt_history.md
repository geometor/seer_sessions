Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input and output are sequences of single digits, represented as space-separated strings.
*   The core transformation seems conditional, as some inputs remain unchanged (train_3, train_4, train_6).
*   The digit '2' appears to play a significant role in triggering the transformation. When the output changes, a '2' is always present in the input.
*   The digit '0' is also crucial. The changes involve removing a '0' and appending a '0'.
*   The transformation involves modifying the sequence structure: removing an element causes subsequent elements to shift left, and a new element ('0') is added at the end.

**YAML Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the index of the first occurrence of the digit `2` in the input sequence.
2.  If `2` is not found in the sequence, return the original sequence unchanged.
3.  If `2` is found, search the portion of the sequence *starting from the position immediately after* the first `2`.
4.  Find the index of the *first* digit `0` in this searched portion that is immediately followed by a non-zero digit.
5.  If such a `0` is found:
    a.  Remove this specific `0` from the sequence.
    b.  Append a `0` to the end of the modified sequence.
    c.  Return the resulting sequence.
6.  If no such `0` (a `0` followed by a non-zero digit) is found in the sequence after the first `2`, return the original sequence unchanged.
