This search starts at the index *immediately following* `i` (i.e., index `i + 1`) and continues up to, but *does not include*, the last element of the sequence (i.e., up to index `length - 2`).\nDuring the search, for each element at the current index `j`:\n  a.  Check if the element `sequence[j]` is equal to `0`.\n  b.  Check if the *next* element in the sequence, `sequence[j + 1]`, is *not* equal to `0`.\nIf *both* conditions (a and b) are true for an element at index `j`, then this is the *target element* for transformation. Record this index `j` as the `target_index` and immediately *stop* the search process (only the first such occurrence matters).\nAfter completing the search (either by finding a target or reaching the end of the search range):\n  a.  If a `target_index` *was* recorded: Create a new sequence by taking the original sequence, removing the element at the `target_index`, and then appending a single `0` to the very end.
