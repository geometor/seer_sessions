*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single digits, likely represented as integers, separated by spaces. The length of the sequence appears fixed (12 digits in all examples).
    *   The core operation involves identifying specific patterns within the sequence.
    *   The pattern seems to be a contiguous block (run) of identical non-zero digits.
    *   The transformation rule depends on the element immediately preceding this block.
    *   The action involves shifting this block one position to the left if the preceding element is a zero, and appending a zero at the end to maintain the sequence length.
    *   Crucially, the transformation seems to apply only to the *last* such block found in the sequence when reading from left to right (or equivalently, the first found when reading right to left).
    *   If the condition (preceding element is zero) is not met for the last block, or if no such block exists, the sequence remains unchanged.

*   **YAML Fact Document:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Identify the last contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift it left if preceded by zero.
    elements:
      - object: sequence
        description: A fixed-length list of single-digit integers.
        properties:
          - length: 12 (based on examples)
          - type: List[int]
      - object: block
        description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits within the main sequence.
        properties:
          - identity: All digits within the block are the same.
          - value: The digit must be non-zero (1-9).
          - contiguity: Elements are adjacent in the sequence.
        relationship: The task focuses on the *last* such block occurring in the sequence.
      - object: trigger_element
        description: The element immediately preceding the start of the identified 'last block'.
        properties:
          - existence: Must exist (block cannot start at the very beginning of the sequence).
          - value: Must be 0 to trigger the transformation.
    action:
      - name: conditional_shift
        description: If the trigger_element is 0, the 'last block' is moved one position left, replacing the trigger_element, and a 0 is appended to the sequence end.
        condition: trigger_element exists and is 0.
        steps:
          - Identify the start and end indices of the last contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
          - Check if the block starts after index 0 and if the element at `start_index - 1` is 0.
          - If true:
            - Construct the output sequence by taking elements before the trigger zero, followed by the block, followed by elements after the block in the original input, and finally appending a 0.
          - If false:
            - The output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
    examples_analysis:
      - train_1, train_3, train_4: No change, as the last non-zero block ('2', '2', '2' respectively) is not preceded by '0'.
      - train_2: Last block '1' is preceded by '0'. '1' shifts left, '0' appended.
      - train_5: Last block '99999' is preceded by '0'. Block shifts left, '0' appended.
      - train_6: Last block '888888' is preceded by '0'. Block shifts left, '0' appended.
      - train_7: Last block '88888' is preceded by '0'. Block shifts left, '0' appended.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Convert the input string of space-separated digits into a list of integers.
    2.  Search the list from right to left to find the start index, end index, and value of the last contiguous block composed of identical non-zero digits.
    3.  If no such block is found (e.g., the list contains only zeros or no repeating non-zero digits), return the original input list formatted as a space-separated string.
    4.  If a block is found, check if its start index is greater than 0 (meaning it has a preceding element).
    5.  If the block has a preceding element, check if this preceding element (at `start_index - 1`) is equal to 0.
    6.  If both conditions (block exists, starts after index 0, and is preceded by 0) are true:
        a.  Create a new list by concatenating:
            i.  The elements of the original list from the beginning up to (but not including) the preceding 0 (index `start_index - 1`).
            ii. The identified block of non-zero digits.
            iii.The elements of the original list from the position immediately after the block (`end_index + 1`) to the end of the original list.
            iv. A single integer `0`.
        b.  Convert this new list back into a space-separated string and return it.
    7.  If the conditions in step 5 are not met (block starts at index 0, or the preceding element is not 0), return the original input list formatted as a space-separated string.
