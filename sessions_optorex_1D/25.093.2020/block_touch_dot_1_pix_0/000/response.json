The length of the sequence appears fixed (12 digits in all examples).\n    *   The core operation involves identifying specific patterns within the sequence.\n    *   The pattern seems to be a contiguous block (run) of identical non-zero digits.\n    *   The transformation rule depends on the element immediately preceding this block.\n    *   The action involves shifting this block one position to the left if the preceding element is a zero, and appending a zero at the end to maintain the sequence length.\n    *   Crucially, the transformation seems to apply only to the *last* such block found in the sequence when reading from left to right (or equivalently, the first found when reading right to left).\n    *   If the condition (preceding element is zero) is not met for the last block, or if no such block exists, the sequence remains unchanged.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n    "
