task_description: Modify a sequence of integers by identifying the last contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. If this block is immediately preceded by a zero, shift the block one position to the left (replacing the zero) and append a zero to maintain the sequence length.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A fixed-length 1-dimensional array or list of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - length: 12 (observed in examples)
      - type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray
      - element_range: 0-9
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits within the main sequence.
    properties:
      - identity: All digits within the block are the same.
      - value: The digit must be non-zero (1-9).
      - contiguity: Elements are adjacent in the sequence.
    relationship: The task focuses specifically on the *last* such block occurring in the sequence when read from left to right.
  - object: trigger_element
    description: The element immediately preceding the start of the identified 'last block'.
    properties:
      - existence: Must exist (block cannot start at the very beginning of the sequence, index 0).
      - value: Must be 0 to trigger the transformation.
action:
  - name: conditional_left_shift_append
    description: If the 'trigger_element' for the 'last block' is 0, the block is moved one position left, effectively overwriting the trigger zero, and a 0 is appended to the sequence end.
    condition: The last contiguous block of identical non-zero digits starts after index 0, AND the element at `start_index - 1` is 0.
    steps:
      - Identify the start and end indices of the last contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence.
      - Check if such a block exists and if its start index (`start_index`) is greater than 0.
      - If yes, check if the element at index `start_index - 1` is 0.
      - If both conditions are true:
        - Construct the output sequence by taking elements before the trigger zero (up to `start_index - 1`), followed by the block itself (from `start_index` to `end_index`), followed by elements after the block in the original input (from `end_index + 1` onwards), and finally appending a 0.
      - If either condition is false (no block found, block starts at index 0, or preceding element is not 0):
        - The output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
examples_analysis:
  - train_1, train_3, train_4: No change. Last block ('2', '2', '2') not preceded by '0'.
  - train_2: Last block '1' preceded by '0'. Shift left, append 0.
  - train_5: Last block '99999' preceded by '0'. Shift left, append 0.
  - train_6: Last block '888888' preceded by '0'. Shift left, append 0.
  - train_7: Last block '88888' preceded by '0'. Shift left, append 0.
