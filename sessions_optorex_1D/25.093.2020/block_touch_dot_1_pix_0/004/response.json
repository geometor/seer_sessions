            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary issue is a type mismatch or dimensionality conflict. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly indicates that the `transform` function received a multi-dimensional `numpy.ndarray` (likely 2D, representing a grid), but the code logic attempted to treat elements or slices as single boolean values (e.g., in comparisons like `current_val != 0`). The original interpretation treated the input as a simple 1D sequence. The transformation logic identified (finding the last block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it left if preceded by zero) appears correct based on the input/output pairs when viewed as flattened sequences. The strategy is to adapt the code to explicitly handle a multi-dimensional array input by first flattening it, applying the existing 1D logic, and then returning the result, likely as a 1D array since the outputs are shown flattened.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    The provided examples consistently show inputs and outputs as sequences of 12 digits. The transformation logic, when applied to these sequences treated as 1D lists, correctly maps inputs to outputs in all 7 training cases. The error occurred during execution within the framework, suggesting the framework passes the data as a structure (like a 2D `numpy.ndarray`) that the previous code version didn't correctly handle, even though the underlying logic for a flattened sequence was sound. Let's confirm the input type and shape using a tool call within the `transform` function if possible, though I cannot directly modify and run the code here. Assuming the framework provides a `numpy.ndarray`:\n    "
