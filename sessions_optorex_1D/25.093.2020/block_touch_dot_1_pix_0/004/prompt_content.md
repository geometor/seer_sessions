"""
Modify a sequence of integers by identifying the last contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. 
If this block starts after the first position (index > 0) and is immediately preceded by a zero, 
shift the block one position to the left (replacing the zero) and append a zero to maintain 
the sequence length. Otherwise, the sequence remains unchanged.
