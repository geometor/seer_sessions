Specifically, the value `2` acts as a blocker for the swap.\n5.  **Target Subsequence:** The rule focuses on the *longest* such contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero numbers within the list.\n6.  **Swap Direction:** The direction of the swap (with the preceding or succeeding element) depends on whether the subsequence starts at the beginning of the list.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
