"""
Identifies the longest contiguous sequence of identical non-zero numbers in the input list.
Checks the immediate neighbors (preceding and succeeding) of this sequence.
If either neighbor has the value 2, the list remains unchanged (swap is blocked).
Otherwise, if the swap is not blocked:
- If a preceding neighbor exists (sequence doesn't start at index 0), the sequence is effectively swapped with this preceding neighbor. The preceding neighbor moves to the position immediately after where the sequence ended, and the sequence shifts one position to the left to occupy the space including the original neighbor's position.
- If only a succeeding neighbor exists (sequence starts at index 0), the sequence is effectively swapped with this succeeding neighbor. The succeeding neighbor moves to the beginning of the list (index 0), and the sequence shifts one position to the right starting at index 1.
If no such non-zero sequence is found, if the swap is blocked by a '2', or if the sequence occupies the entire list without valid neighbors to swap with according to the rules, the original list is returned unchanged.
