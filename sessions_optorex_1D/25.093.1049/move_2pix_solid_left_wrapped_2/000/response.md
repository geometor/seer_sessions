**Perception:**

The input and output are both sequences (lists) of integers. Each sequence in the provided examples has a length of 12. Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern: the elements in the output sequence appear to be the elements of the input sequence shifted two positions to the left, with the elements shifted off the beginning wrapping around to the end. This is characteristic of a circular left shift or rotation operation. The magnitude of the shift is consistently 2 positions across all examples.

**Facts:**


```yaml
- object: input_sequence
  type: list
  properties:
    - elements: integers
    - length: 12 (in all examples)
- object: output_sequence
  type: list
  properties:
    - elements: integers
    - length: 12 (in all examples)
- action: circular_left_shift
  actor: transformation_rule
  acted_on: input_sequence
  parameters:
    - shift_amount: 2
  result: output_sequence
- relationship: element_mapping
  description: Each element at index `i` in the output sequence corresponds to the element at index `(i + 2) % length` in the input sequence, where `length` is the length of the sequence (12 in these examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
2.  Perform a circular left shift on the sequence by 2 positions.
3.  The resulting sequence is the output.
