Okay, let's break down the transformation logic based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (or lists) of 12 single digits.
2.  **Digits:** The digits involved are primarily 0, 4, 5, 8, 9. The digit '0' appears to play a special role, often acting as a background or placeholder.
3.  **Transformation Type:** The transformation involves rearranging the elements within the sequence. The relative order of the non-zero digits seems preserved, but their absolute positions change.
4.  **Core Mechanism:** Comparing inputs and outputs suggests a shift or rotation operation. Specifically, the non-zero elements appear to shift two positions to the left.
5.  **Boundary Handling:** The shift seems to be circular or wrap-around (modulo the sequence length). For example, an element at index 1 shifts to index 11, and an element at index 0 shifts to index 10.
6.  **Role of Zeros:** Zeros fill the positions that are not occupied by the shifted non-zero elements. They don't seem to shift themselves but rather occupy the "empty" slots created by the movement of non-zero elements.

**YAML Facts:**

    condition: position in output_sequence not filled by a mapped non-zero element
    action: set value to 0
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output sequence of length 12, initially filled with a placeholder value (e.g., null or empty).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from index 0 to 11.
3.  For each element in the input sequence:
    a.  Check if the element is non-zero.
    b.  If the element is non-zero, calculate its target index in the output sequence by subtracting 2 from its current index and taking the result modulo 12 (this handles the wrap-around).
    c.  Place the non-zero element at the calculated target index in the output sequence.
4.  After processing all elements from the input sequence, iterate through the output sequence.
5.  Replace any remaining placeholder values in the output sequence with the digit 0.
6.  The resulting sequence is the final output.
