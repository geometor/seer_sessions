            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code failed across all examples with the same error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, while the testing environment provided a NumPy array directly.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is straightforward: modify the function signature and internal logic to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers) as input, eliminating the string parsing step (`.split()`). The core transformation logic\u2014identifying non-zero elements and shifting them two positions to the left with wrap-around\u2014appears consistent with the examples provided and likely remains correct.\n\n**Gather Metrics**\n\nThe execution results show a consistent failure mode across all training and test examples.\n\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError`\n*   **Error Message:** `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`\n*   **Affected Examples:** All (train_1 through train_7, and the hidden test example)\n*   **Root Cause:** Input type mismatch. The function expected `str`, but received `numpy.ndarray`.\n\nNo further metrics can be gathered about the correctness of the transformation *logic* itself until the input type error is resolved. However, the consistency of the error strongly suggests the input type is the sole immediate problem.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
