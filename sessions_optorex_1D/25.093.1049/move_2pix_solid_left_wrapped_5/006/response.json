            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously \u2013 shifting non-zero elements two positions to the left with wrap-around \u2013 appears correct and consistent across all examples. The errors reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly suggest an issue in how the NumPy arrays were handled either during input processing or within the testing harness itself, likely treating a 1D sequence as a 2D array (e.g., `[[...]]` instead of `[...]`). The underlying algorithm described in the previous natural language program seems sound.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to re-affirm the 1D nature of the data and the correctness of the circular shift logic. The implementation needs to strictly handle the input and output as 1D arrays of length 12. The natural language program will be refined for clarity, emphasizing the 1D structure and the specific modulo arithmetic for the shift.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nCode execution confirms the following:\n*   Input sequences are consistently 1D arrays/lists of length 12.\n*   Output sequences are consistently 1D arrays/lists of length 12.\n*   The transformation involves relocating non-zero elements.\n*   The relocation rule `output_index = (input_index - 2) % 12` holds true for non-zero elements across verified examples (e.g., Example 1: input index 7 maps to output index 5; Example 3: input indices 0, 1, ..., 5, 10, 11 map correctly to output indices 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9).\n*   Positions in the output not receiving a shifted non-zero element retain the value 0.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
