```python
"""
Transforms a one-dimensional input sequence (list or array) containing exactly 12 integer elements.
A new one-dimensional output sequence of the same length (12 elements) is created and initialized with all elements set to 0.
Each element of the input sequence is examined along with its index (from 0 to 11).
If an element's value at 'input_index' is non-zero, its 'output_index' is calculated as (input_index - 2) modulo 12. This performs a circular left shift by 2 positions.
The non-zero value from the input is then placed at the calculated 'output_index' in the output sequence.
Elements in the output sequence that do not receive a non-zero value remain 0.
The final output sequence is returned.
