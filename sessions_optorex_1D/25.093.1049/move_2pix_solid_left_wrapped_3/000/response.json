The transformation rule appears consistent across all examples and involves a positional shift of the elements within the sequence. Observing the examples, the elements at the beginning of the input sequence seem to move to the end of the output sequence, while the remaining elements shift forward. Specifically, the first two elements consistently wrap around to the end.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
