## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming an input sequence of 12 single-digit integers into an output sequence of the same length. The transformation rule appears consistent across all examples and involves a positional shift of the elements within the sequence. Observing the examples, the elements at the beginning of the input sequence seem to move to the end of the output sequence, while the remaining elements shift forward. Specifically, the first two elements consistently wrap around to the end.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)

actions:
  - name: cyclic_shift_left
    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - positions: 2
    output: output_sequence

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is the result of applying a left cyclic shift of 2 positions to the input sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 numbers.
2.  Identify the first two elements of the sequence.
3.  Identify the remaining elements from the third element to the end of the sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing the remaining elements (step 3) and then appending the first two elements (step 2) at the end. This is equivalent to performing a left cyclic shift (or rotation) by 2 positions on the input sequence.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 numbers by performing a left cyclic shift of 2 positions.

    """
    # Parse the input string into a list of integers
    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]

    # Check if the input list has the expected length (12)
    if len(input_list) != 12:
        raise ValueError("Input sequence must contain exactly 12 numbers.")

    # Perform the left cyclic shift by 2 positions
    # Take the elements from index 2 to the end
    shifted_part = input_list[2:]
    # Take the first two elements
    wrapped_part = input_list[:2]
    # Concatenate them to form the output list
    output_list = shifted_part + wrapped_part

    # Format the output list back into a space-separated string

    return output_str
