            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic as a left cyclic shift (or rotation) by 2 positions. All provided training examples consistently follow this pattern: the first two elements of the input sequence are moved to the end, and the remaining elements shift to the left.\n\nThe errors reported (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicate that the code execution environment is passing the input data as NumPy arrays, not as space-separated strings as initially assumed based on the example format. The Python code was written expecting a string input (`input_str`) and attempting to call the `.split()` method on it, which is valid for strings but not for NumPy arrays.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Transformation Logic:** Re-verify that the left cyclic shift by 2 holds for all examples. (This was done mentally above and holds true).\n2.  **Adapt to Input Type:** Recognize that the `transform` function will receive a sequence structure (likely a NumPy array or potentially a list) rather than a string.\n3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to describe the transformation on a generic sequence, avoiding assumptions about string formatting or the need for parsing/splitting within the core logic description. The focus should remain on the sequence manipulation itself.\n4.  **Update Facts:** Adjust the description of the `input_sequence` object to reflect its nature as a sequence (list or array) of integers, rather than implicitly a string.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the input/output structure and the transformation logic using one example, assuming the input is treated as a list or array.\n\n**Example 1 Verification:**\nInput: `[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]` (as a list/array)\nExpected Output: `[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]`\n\nApplying left cyclic shift by 2:\n- Elements to wrap around: `[9, 9]` (index 0, 1)\n- Remaining elements: `[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]` (index 2 to 11)\n- Concatenated result: `[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9] + [9, 9]` = `[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]`\nThis matches the expected output.\n\nWe can use `tool_code` to demonstrate this logic programmatically.\n"
