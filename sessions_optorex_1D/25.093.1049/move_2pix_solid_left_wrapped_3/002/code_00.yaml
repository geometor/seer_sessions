objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence # Could be list, numpy array, etc.
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence # Matches input type
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) # Same elements as input, reordered

actions:
  - name: cyclic_shift_left # Also known as left rotation
    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - positions: 2
    output: output_sequence

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is generated by performing a left cyclic shift of 2 positions on the input sequence. The first two elements of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence, and all other elements shift two positions to the left.
