## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming an input sequence of 12 single-digit integers into an output sequence of the same length. The transformation rule appears consistent across all examples and involves a positional shift of the elements within the sequence. Observing the examples, the elements at the beginning of the input sequence seem to move to the end of the output sequence, while the remaining elements shift forward. Specifically, the first two elements consistently wrap around to the end.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)

actions:
  - name: cyclic_shift_left
    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - positions: 2
    output: output_sequence

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is the result of applying a left cyclic shift of 2 positions to the input sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 numbers.
2.  Identify the first two elements of the sequence.
3.  Identify the remaining elements from the third element to the end of the sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by first placing the remaining elements (step 3) and then appending the first two elements (step 2) at the end. This is equivalent to performing a left cyclic shift (or rotation) by 2 positions on the input sequence.

        raise ValueError("Input sequence must contain exactly 12 numbers.")

    # Perform the left cyclic shift by 2 positions
    # Take the elements from index 2 to the end
    shifted_part = input_list[2:]
    # Take the first two elements
    wrapped_part = input_list[:2]
    # Concatenate them to form the output list

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic as a left cyclic shift (or rotation) by 2 positions. All provided training examples consistently follow this pattern: the first two elements of the input sequence are moved to the end, and the remaining elements shift to the left.

The errors reported (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicate that the code execution environment is passing the input data as NumPy arrays, not as space-separated strings as initially assumed based on the example format. The Python code was written expecting a string input (`input_str`) and attempting to call the `.split()` method on it, which is valid for strings but not for NumPy arrays.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Transformation Logic:** Re-verify that the left cyclic shift by 2 holds for all examples. (This was done mentally above and holds true).
2.  **Adapt to Input Type:** Recognize that the `transform` function will receive a sequence structure (likely a NumPy array or potentially a list) rather than a string.
3.  **Refine Natural Language Program:** Update the program to describe the transformation on a generic sequence, avoiding assumptions about string formatting or the need for parsing/splitting within the core logic description. The focus should remain on the sequence manipulation itself.
4.  **Update Facts:** Adjust the description of the `input_sequence` object to reflect its nature as a sequence (list or array) of integers, rather than implicitly a string.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the input/output structure and the transformation logic using one example, assuming the input is treated as a list or array.

**Example 1 Verification:**
Input: `[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]` (as a list/array)
Expected Output: `[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]`

Applying left cyclic shift by 2:
- Elements to wrap around: `[9, 9]` (index 0, 1)
- Remaining elements: `[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]` (index 2 to 11)
- Concatenated result: `[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9] + [9, 9]` = `[9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]`
This matches the expected output.

We can use `tool_code` to demonstrate this logic programmatically.


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Representing input as a list (or could be np.array)
input_list = [9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9]
expected_output_list = [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

# Perform left cyclic shift by 2
n = 2
output_list = input_list[n:] + input_list[:n]

# Verify input/output lengths and equality
print(f"Input Length: {len(input_list)}")
print(f"Output Length: {len(output_list)}")
print(f"Calculated Output: {output_list}")
print(f"Expected Output:   {expected_output_list}")
print(f"Output matches expected: {output_list == expected_output_list}")

# Using numpy.roll for comparison
input_array = np.array(input_list)
output_array_np = np.roll(input_array, -n) # Negative shift for left roll
print(f"NumPy Roll Output: {output_array_np.tolist()}")
print(f"NumPy Roll matches expected: {output_array_np.tolist() == expected_output_list}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Input Length: 12
Output Length: 12
Calculated Output: [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Expected Output:   [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Output matches expected: True
NumPy Roll Output: [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
NumPy Roll matches expected: True

```
The code execution confirms that the input and output sequences consistently have a length of 12 and that a left cyclic shift (rotation) by 2 positions correctly transforms the input into the output for the tested example. This reinforces the core transformation logic.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence containing 12 integers.
2.  Perform a left cyclic shift (or left rotation) on the sequence by 2 positions.
    *   This involves taking the first 2 elements from the beginning of the sequence.
    *   Taking the remaining 10 elements (from the 3rd element to the end).
    *   Constructing the output sequence by concatenating the remaining 10 elements followed by the first 2 elements.
3.  Return the resulting sequence of 12 integers.
