objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence # Using sequence as a more general term than list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
      - representation: space-separated string or list/array of integers
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9) derived from input_sequence
      - representation: space-separated string or list/array of integers

actions:
  - name: cyclic_shift_left # Also known as left rotation
    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - positions: 2 # The fixed number of positions to shift
    output: output_sequence
    description: Moves the first 'positions' elements to the end of the sequence, shifting the remaining elements to the beginning.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by applying a cyclic_shift_left operation with positions=2.
