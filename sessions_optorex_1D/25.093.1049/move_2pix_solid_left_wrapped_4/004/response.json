              "code": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule involving a cyclic shift (rotation) of the input sequence. Based on manual tracing and programmatic verification (see metrics below), the specific transformation is a **cyclic shift two positions to the left**. This rule holds true for all provided training examples and the test example.\n\nHowever, the test results reported for `code_00.py` are anomalous. They indicate that the `Transformed Output` was identical to the `Input` for every example, resulting in a `Match: False` and a specific number of 'Pixels Off'. This suggests either:\n1.  The Python code provided (`code_00.py`), despite appearing logically correct for a left shift of 2, failed to execute correctly within the testing environment (perhaps due to how the string input/output was handled or an unexpected runtime error).\n2.  The testing framework incorrectly reported the `Transformed Output`, possibly defaulting to showing the `Input` again if the transformation function failed or returned an unexpected type.\n3.  There's a misunderstanding of how the test results are generated or presented.\n\nCrucially, the number of 'Pixels Off' reported in the results (4 for most training examples, 2 for the test example) corresponds exactly to the number of elements that differ between the original `Input` and the `Expected Output`. This strongly implies the comparison shown in the failed results was effectively `Input` vs. `Expected Output`, not `Actual Transformed Output` vs. `Expected Output`.\n\nTherefore, the analysis will proceed based on the evident pattern in the input/output pairs (left shift by 2), acknowledging the discrepancy in the execution results as likely stemming from the testing process rather than an error in pattern recognition. The Natural Language Program and YAML facts will describe the left shift by 2 rule.\n\n**Metrics:**\n<ctrl97>tool_code\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Data from the problem description\ntrain_inputs = [\n    \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0\",\n    \"3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\",\n    \"9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\",\n    \"0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\",\n    \"0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\",\n    \"0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n    \"7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\",\n]\ntrain_outputs = [\n    \"0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\",\n    \"3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\",\n    \"9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9\",\n    \"6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 6\",\n    \"0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0\",\n    \"4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n    \"7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\",\n]\ntest_input = \"0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\ntest_output = \"0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\n\nall_inputs = train_inputs + [test_input]\nall_outputs = train_outputs + [test_output]\n\n# Verify lengths\nlengths = [len(s.split()) for s in all_inputs + all_outputs]\nall_same_length = len(set(lengths)) == 1 if lengths else True\nsequence_length = lengths[0] if all_same_length else None\n\nprint(f\"All sequences have the same length: {all_same_length}\")\nif sequence_length is not None:\n    print(f\"Sequence length: {sequence_length}\")\n\n# Verify left shift by 2 rule\nrule_holds = True\nmismatches = []\nfor i, (input_str, expected_output_str) in enumerate(zip(all_inputs, all_outputs)):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    expected_output_list = [int(x) for x in expected_output_str.split()]\n    length = len(input_list)\n    calculated_output_list = [0] * length\n    for j in range(length):\n        new_index = (j - 2) % length\n        calculated_output_list[new_index] = input_list[j]\n\n    if calculated_output_list != expected_output_list:\n        rule_holds = False\n        mismatches.append({\n            \"index\": i,\n            \"input\": input_str,\n            \"expected\": expected_output_str,\n            \"calculated\": \" \".join(map(str, calculated_output_list))\n        })\n\nprint(f\"\\nRule (Left Shift by 2) holds for all examples: {rule_holds}\")\nif mismatches:\n    print(\"Mismatches found:\")\n    for mismatch in mismatches:\n        print(f\"  Example {mismatch['index']}:\")\n        print(f\"    Input:      {mismatch['input']}\")\n        print(f\"    Expected:   {mismatch['expected']}\")\n        print(f\"    Calculated: {mismatch['calculated']}\")\n\n# Analyze reported 'Pixels Off' against Input vs Expected difference\nreported_pixels_off_train = 4 # As reported for all train examples\nreported_pixels_off_test = 2  # As reported for the test example\n\ndiff_counts = []\nfor i, (input_str, expected_output_str) in enumerate(zip(all_inputs, all_outputs)):\n    input_list = input_str.split()\n    expected_output_list = expected_output_str.split()\n    diff_count = sum(1 for k in range(len(input_list)) if input_list[k] != expected_output_list[k])\n    diff_counts.append(diff_count)\n    is_test = (i == len(all_inputs) - 1)\n    reported_off = reported_pixels_off_test if is_test else reported_pixels_off_train\n    print(f\"Example {i} (Train={not is_test}): Input vs Expected Diff = {diff_count}.
