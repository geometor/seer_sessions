**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The key elements are:
1.  **Input/Output Sequence:** A linear arrangement of numbers.
2.  **Elements:** Individual digits within the sequence (0-9).
3.  **Position:** The index of each element within the sequence.
4.  **Transformation:** A consistent operation applied to the entire sequence.

Observing the examples reveals a pattern: the elements in the output sequence are the same as those in the input sequence, but their positions have changed. Specifically, it appears that the entire sequence is shifted cyclically (rotated) to the left by a fixed amount. Comparing the first element of the output with the third element of the input across multiple examples confirms a shift of 2 positions to the left, with elements wrapping around from the beginning to the end.

**YAML Facts:**

Task: Sequence Transformation

Input_Object:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Range: 0-9
  Properties:
    - Length: Fixed (12 in all examples)
    - Order: Significant

    Type: Integer
    Range: 0-9
  Properties:
    - Length: Same as input
    - Order: Significant

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Shift (Rotation)

  Description: Each element at index `i` in the input sequence moves to index `(i - 2) mod L` in the output sequence, where `L` is the length of the sequence.

Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The relative order of elements is preserved cyclically.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Perform a cyclic shift (rotation) of all elements in the sequence two positions to the left.
3.  The element originally at index 0 moves to index (length - 2).
4.  The element originally at index 1 moves to index (length - 1).
5.  For any other element originally at index `i` (where `i >= 2`), move it to index `i - 2`.
6.  The resulting sequence is the output.

**General Assessment:**

The primary issue identified by the execution results is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The initial analysis correctly deduced the transformation rule (a cyclic left shift by 2 positions), but assumed the input was a space-separated string. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the input is actually a NumPy array (or similar list-like structure) containing integers.

The strategy is to correct the understanding of the input format and adapt the transformation logic accordingly. The core transformation logic (cyclic shift) appears sound based on the examples, but the implementation needs to operate directly on the list/array structure instead of attempting string parsing.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's re-examine the examples assuming the input is a list of integers. We will verify the length and the left shift of 2 positions using `tool_code`.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]` (Length 12)
    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Element at index 7 (4) moves to index (7 - 2) % 12 = 5. Matches.
    *   Element at index 0 (0) moves to index (0 - 2) % 12 = 10. Matches.
*   **Example 2:**
    *   Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]` (Length 12)
    *   Output: `[3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]`
    *   Element at index 0 (3) moves to index (0 - 2) % 12 = 10. Matches.
    *   Element at index 11 (3) moves to index (11 - 2) % 12 = 9. Matches.

Let's use `tool_code` to programmatically verify the shift logic for Example 1:


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

input_list = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
length = len(input_list)
output_list = [0] * length
shift = 2 # Left shift amount

for i in range(length):
    # Calculate the target index for the element currently at index i
    new_index = (i - shift) % length
    output_list[new_index] = input_list[i]

expected_output = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
print(f'Input: {input_list}')
print(f'Calculated Output: {output_list}')
print(f'Expected Output: {expected_output}')
print(f'Match: {output_list == expected_output}')
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Input: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]
Calculated Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Expected Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Match: True

```
The calculation confirms the left cyclic shift logic by 2 positions is correct when applied directly to a list representation of the input. All examples consistently show this pattern.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence, which is a list or array of integers.
2.  Determine the length (`L`) of the input sequence.
3.  Create a new output sequence of the same length `L`, initially empty or filled with placeholders.
4.  Iterate through each element of the input sequence using its index `i` (from 0 to `L-1`).
5.  For each element at index `i` in the input sequence, calculate its new index in the output sequence as `(i - 2) mod L`.
6.  Place the element from the input sequence at index `i` into the calculated new index in the output sequence.
7.  Return the fully populated output sequence.
