            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified by the execution results is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The initial analysis correctly deduced the transformation rule (a cyclic left shift by 2 positions), but assumed the input was a space-separated string. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the input is actually a NumPy array (or similar list-like structure) containing integers.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the understanding of the input format and adapt the transformation logic accordingly. The core transformation logic (cyclic shift) appears sound based on the examples, but the implementation needs to operate directly on the list/array structure instead of attempting string parsing.\n\n**Gather Metrics:**\n\nLet's re-examine the examples assuming the input is a list of integers. We will verify the length and the left shift of 2 positions using `tool_code`.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]` (Length 12)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Element at index 7 (4) moves to index (7 - 2) % 12 = 5. Matches.\n    *   Element at index 0 (0) moves to index (0 - 2) % 12 = 10. Matches.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]` (Length 12)\n    *   Output: `[3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]`\n    *   Element at index 0 (3) moves to index (0 - 2) % 12 = 10. Matches.\n    *   Element at index 11 (3) moves to index (11 - 2) % 12 = 9. Matches.\n\nLet's use `tool_code` to programmatically verify the shift logic for Example 1:\n"
