Task: Sequence Transformation

Input_Object:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Range: 0-9
  Properties:
    - Length: Fixed (12 in all examples)
    - Order: Significant

Output_Object:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Range: 0-9
  Properties:
    - Length: Same as input
    - Order: Significant

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Shift (Rotation)
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 2 positions
  Description: Each element at index `i` in the input sequence moves to index `(i - 2) mod L` in the output sequence, where `L` is the length of the sequence.

Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The relative order of elements is preserved cyclically.
