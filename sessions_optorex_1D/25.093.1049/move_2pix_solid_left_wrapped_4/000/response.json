The key elements are:\n1.  **Input/Output Sequence:** A linear arrangement of numbers.\n2.  **Elements:** Individual digits within the sequence (0-9).\n3.  **Position:** The index of each element within the sequence.\n4.  **Transformation:** A consistent operation applied to the entire sequence.\n\nObserving the examples reveals a pattern: the elements in the output sequence are the same as those in the input sequence, but their positions have changed. Specifically, it appears that the entire sequence is shifted cyclically (rotated) to the left by a fixed amount. Comparing the first element of the output with the third element of the input across multiple examples confirms a shift of 2 positions to the left, with elements wrapping around from the beginning to the end.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
