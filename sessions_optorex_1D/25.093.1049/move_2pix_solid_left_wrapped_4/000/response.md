**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The key elements are:
1.  **Input/Output Sequence:** A linear arrangement of numbers.
2.  **Elements:** Individual digits within the sequence (0-9).
3.  **Position:** The index of each element within the sequence.
4.  **Transformation:** A consistent operation applied to the entire sequence.

Observing the examples reveals a pattern: the elements in the output sequence are the same as those in the input sequence, but their positions have changed. Specifically, it appears that the entire sequence is shifted cyclically (rotated) to the left by a fixed amount. Comparing the first element of the output with the third element of the input across multiple examples confirms a shift of 2 positions to the left, with elements wrapping around from the beginning to the end.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input_Object:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Range: 0-9
  Properties:
    - Length: Fixed (12 in all examples)
    - Order: Significant

Output_Object:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Range: 0-9
  Properties:
    - Length: Same as input
    - Order: Significant

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Shift (Rotation)
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 2 positions
  Description: Each element at index `i` in the input sequence moves to index `(i - 2) mod L` in the output sequence, where `L` is the length of the sequence.

Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The relative order of elements is preserved cyclically.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Perform a cyclic shift (rotation) of all elements in the sequence two positions to the left.
3.  The element originally at index 0 moves to index (length - 2).
4.  The element originally at index 1 moves to index (length - 1).
5.  For any other element originally at index `i` (where `i >= 2`), move it to index `i - 2`.
6.  The resulting sequence is the output.
