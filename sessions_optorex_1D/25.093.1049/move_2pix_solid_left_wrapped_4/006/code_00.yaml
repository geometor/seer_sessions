Task: Sequence Transformation

Input_Object:
  Type: Sequence
  Format: String (space-separated integers) or List/Array of integers
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Range: 0-9 (observed)
  Properties:
    - Length: Fixed (12 in all examples)
    - Order: Significant

Output_Object:
  Type: Sequence
  Format: String (space-separated integers) or List/Array of integers
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Range: 0-9 (observed)
  Properties:
    - Length: Same as input (12)
    - Order: Significant
    - Content: Permutation of input elements

Transformation:
  Action: Cyclic Shift (Rotation)
  Direction: Left
  Magnitude: 2 positions
  Description: The entire input sequence is rotated to the left by 2 positions. Elements shifted off the beginning wrap around to the end. Mathematically, the element at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i - 2) mod L` in the output, where `L` is the sequence length (12).

Relationships:
  - Output sequence contains the exact same elements as the input sequence, preserving counts of each number.
  - The relative order of elements is maintained but shifted cyclically.
  - The transformation is deterministic and consistent across all examples.

Execution_Note: Previous test results showing input = output likely indicate an error in test execution, not an error in the transformation rule derived from the examples. The rule (left cyclic shift by 2) is confirmed by direct comparison and calculation across all provided examples.
