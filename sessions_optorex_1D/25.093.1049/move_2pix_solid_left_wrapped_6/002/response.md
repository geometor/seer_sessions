**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The execution results consistently show an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function, within the execution environment, receives a NumPy array as input, not the space-separated string format observed in the problem description's `input:` fields.

The previous code assumed string input and included a `parse_input` function using `.split()`, which is causing the failure. The core transformation logic (cyclic left shift by 2) appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list, as NumPy arrays often behave like lists in slicing/concatenation) directly.
2.  Remove the `parse_input` call.
3.  Assume the function should return the transformed sequence in the same format it was received (likely a list or NumPy array). Remove the `format_output` call, unless further testing reveals a string output is required.
4.  The `rotate_left` helper function using list slicing should work correctly on list-like inputs.

**Metrics:**

*   **Input Data Type:** Inferred as NumPy array based on the error message (`numpy.ndarray`).
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all examples.
*   **Transformation Type:** Cyclic shift (rotation).
*   **Shift Direction:** Left.
*   **Shift Magnitude:** 2 positions.
*   **Error Consistency:** The same `AttributeError` occurred for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the log, confirming the input type issue is systematic.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    container: list or numpy.ndarray # Updated based on error
    elements:
      - type: integer
    properties:
      - length: 12

Transformation:
  - type: rearrangement
  - subtype: cyclic shift
  - parameters:
      - direction: left
      - magnitude: 2
  - scope: entire sequence
  - implementation_details:
      - element at input index `i` moves to output index `(i - 2) % 12`
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence (which is a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Perform a cyclic rotation of the sequence elements 2 positions to the left.
3.  Return the resulting rotated sequence.
