**General Assessment:**

The previous code failed because it was designed to accept a space-separated string as input (`input_str`) and parse it internally. However, the execution environment (test harness) provided the input directly as a NumPy array. The core transformation logic identified (cyclic left shift by 2 positions) appears correct based on the examples, but the function needs to be adapted to handle NumPy array inputs directly and return the output formatted as a space-separated string.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to:
1.  Accept a NumPy array as input.
2.  Perform the cyclic left shift of 2 positions on this array.
3.  Format the resulting array into a space-separated string before returning.

**Metrics:**

*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (inferred from error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`).
*   **Input Shape:** Consistently `(12,)` across all examples (based on original string lengths).
*   **Output Type:** `str` (space-separated integers, based on the provided `output` examples).
*   **Transformation Rule:** Cyclic left shift by 2 positions. This rule holds true for all provided training examples when applied correctly to the sequence elements.
    *   Example 1: `[2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0]` -> `[2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2]` (Shift left by 2)
    *   Example 2: `[0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0]` -> `[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1]` (Shift left by 2)
    *   Example 7: `[0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9]` (Shift left by 2)
*   **Error Consistency:** All examples failed with the same `AttributeError`, confirming the input type mismatch was the sole reason for failure in the previous attempt.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: numpy.ndarray
  shape: (12,)
  dtype: integer (inferred from examples)
  elements: single digits (0-9)

Output:
  type: string
  format: space-separated integers
  content: Represents the transformed sequence.

Transformation:
  action: cyclic shift (rotation)
  target: input numpy.ndarray
  direction: left
  magnitude: 2 positions
  process:
    - Take the input NumPy array of 12 integers.
    - Perform a cyclic rotation moving each element 2 positions to the left.
      (e.g., element at index `i` moves to index `(i - 2) % 12`).
    - Convert the elements of the resulting NumPy array to strings.
    - Join the string elements with spaces to create the output string.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers.
2.  Perform a cyclic left shift on the array by 2 positions. The first two elements wrap around to the end of the array.
3.  Convert each integer element in the shifted array into its string representation.
4.  Join these string representations with a single space character in between.
5.  Return the resulting space-separated string.
