            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed because it was designed to accept a space-separated string as input (`input_str`) and parse it internally. However, the execution environment (test harness) provided the input directly as a NumPy array. The core transformation logic identified (cyclic left shift by 2 positions) appears correct based on the examples, but the function needs to be adapted to handle NumPy array inputs directly and return the output formatted as a space-separated string.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to:\n1.  Accept a NumPy array as input.\n2.  Perform the cyclic left shift of 2 positions on this array.\n3.  Format the resulting array into a space-separated string before returning.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (inferred from error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`).\n*   **Input Shape:** Consistently `(12,)` across all examples (based on original string lengths).\n*   **Output Type:** `str` (space-separated integers, based on the provided `output` examples).\n*   **Transformation Rule:** Cyclic left shift by 2 positions. This rule holds true for all provided training examples when applied correctly to the sequence elements.\n    *   Example 1: `[2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0]` -> `[2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2]` (Shift left by 2)\n    *   Example 2: `[0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0]` -> `[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1]` (Shift left by 2)\n    *   Example 7: `[0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9]` (Shift left by 2)\n*   **Error Consistency:** All examples failed with the same `AttributeError`, confirming the input type mismatch was the sole reason for failure in the previous attempt.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
