Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation task.

**Perception:**

The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings. Each sequence appears to have a fixed length of 12 elements. The transformation involves rearranging the elements within the sequence. Comparing the input and output sequences across all examples, it seems like the elements are shifted cyclically to the left. The amount of shift appears constant across all examples. Specifically, the element at index `i` in the input moves to index `(i - 2) mod 12` in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    subtype: integer
    representation: space-separated string
    length: 12
    elements: single digits (0-9)

Transformation:
  - type: rearrangement
    subtype: cyclic shift (rotation)
    direction: left
    magnitude: 2 positions
    scope: entire sequence

Relationships:
  - output_index = (input_index - 2) mod 12
  - output_element_at[output_index] = input_element_at[input_index]
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Treat the input sequence of 12 integers as a circular list.
2.  Rotate the entire sequence 2 positions to the left.
3.  The resulting sequence is the output.
