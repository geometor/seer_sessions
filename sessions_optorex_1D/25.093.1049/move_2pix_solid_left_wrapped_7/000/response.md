*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of integers separated by spaces.
    *   Each sequence consistently contains 12 integer elements.
    *   The transformation involves rearranging the elements within the sequence.
    *   Comparing input and output sequences reveals a consistent positional shift of elements. Specifically, elements appear to move two positions to the left.
    *   The shift operation wraps around; elements shifted off the left end reappear on the right end. This indicates a circular or rotational shift.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list of integers
        properties:
          - length: 12
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list of integers
        properties:
          - length: 12
      - name: element
        type: integer
    actions:
      - name: circular_left_shift
        parameters:
          - sequence: input_sequence
          - shift_amount: 2 (constant)
        output: output_sequence
    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        from: input_sequence
        to: output_sequence
        rule: apply circular_left_shift with shift_amount 2
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Perform a circular left shift on the sequence by 2 positions.
    3.  The resulting sequence is the output.
