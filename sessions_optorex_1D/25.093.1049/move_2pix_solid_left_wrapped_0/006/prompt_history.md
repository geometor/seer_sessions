Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Element Types:** The sequences contain integers, with '0' being a prominent element alongside other digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the examples).
3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary change between input and output appears to be the rearrangement of elements. Specifically, the positions of the '0' digits seem to be systematically shifted.
4.  **Pattern Recognition:** Comparing the indices of the '0's in the input and output reveals a consistent pattern across examples: the index of each '0' in the output is 2 less than its index in the input, calculated modulo 12 (wrapping around from the beginning if the result is negative).
5.  **Handling Non-Zeros:** The non-zero elements from the input fill the positions in the output list that are *not* occupied by the shifted '0's. Importantly, the relative order of these non-zero elements is preserved from the input to the output.

**YAML Facts**

    steps:

    description: The relative order of non_zero_elements in input_list is maintained in output_list.
  - type: complementary_placement
    description: Non-zero elements fill the positions not occupied by the shifted zero elements.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a new list, `output_list`, of length 12, initially empty or filled with placeholders.
2.  Create an empty list called `non_zero_elements` to store the non-zero digits from the input in order.
3.  Create an empty list called `zero_target_indices` to store the calculated destination indices for the zeros.
4.  Iterate through the `input_list` from index `i = 0` to `11`:
    *   If the element at `input_list[i]` is 0, calculate its target index `j = (i - 2) % 12`. Add `j` to the `zero_target_indices` list.
    *   If the element at `input_list[i]` is not 0, append this element to the `non_zero_elements` list.
5.  Iterate through the `zero_target_indices` list. For each target index `j` in the list, set `output_list[j] = 0`.
6.  Initialize a counter `k = 0` for the `non_zero_elements` list.
7.  Iterate through the `output_list` from index `i = 0` to `11`:
    *   If `output_list[i]` is still empty or a placeholder (i.e., not yet assigned a 0), set `output_list[i]` to the element `non_zero_elements[k]`, and increment `k` by 1.
8.  Return the fully constructed `output_list`.
