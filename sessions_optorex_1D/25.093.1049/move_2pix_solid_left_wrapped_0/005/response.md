"""
Transforms an input string of 12 space-separated digits by:
1. Parsing the string into a list of 12 integers.
2. Identifying the positions (indices) of all '0' elements.
3. Calculating new target positions for these '0's by shifting their original indices two steps to the left (index - 2), wrapping around using modulo 12 arithmetic.
4. Collecting all non-zero elements from the input list while preserving their original relative order.
5. Creating a new output list of 12 elements.
6. Placing the '0's into the output list at their calculated target positions.
7. Filling the remaining empty positions in the output list with the collected non-zero elements, in their preserved order.
8. Formatting the resulting output list back into a space-separated string.
