            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code, designed to perform a circular left shift by 2 positions on non-zero elements of a 12-element list, failed across all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This error indicates that the input data (`input_list`) within the testing environment is likely being passed as a NumPy array with more than one dimension (e.g., `[[element1, element2, ...]]` or `np.array([[...]])`) instead of a simple 1D Python list. When `enumerate` iterates over such a structure, the `value` variable becomes an array (representing a row), and the comparison `value != 0` attempts to evaluate the truthiness of the entire array, leading to the ambiguity error.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to first check the structure of the input `input_list`.\n2.  If the input is a nested list or a multi-dimensional NumPy array (specifically shape (1, 12)), extract the actual 1D sequence data (likely the first element/row).\n3.  Apply the original transformation logic (circular left shift by 2 for non-zero elements) to this extracted 1D sequence.\n4.  Ensure the output format matches the expected format (a 1D list of 12 integers).\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (circular left shift by 2) appears correct and does not need revision based on the error message; only the input handling needs adjustment.\n\n**Metrics**\n\n*   **Consistency:** The exact same `ValueError` occurred for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example.\n*   **Error Type:** `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`\n*   **Likely Cause:** The comparison `if value != 0:` was performed on a NumPy array `value` instead of a scalar integer. This points to the input `input_list` being treated as a 2D array (e.g., shape (1, 12)) by the execution environment, causing `enumerate` to yield the entire row as `value`.\n*   **Transformation Logic Validity:** The underlying logic of shifting non-zero elements left by 2 circularly seems sound based on the initial manual analysis of the examples. The error is related to data type/structure handling, not the transformation rule itself.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
