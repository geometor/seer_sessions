objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - ordered elements
      - fixed length (12 in all examples)
      - contains non-negative integers (0-9 observed)
actions:
  - name: rotate_right_circularly
    input: sequence
    output: sequence
    description: Moves the element at the last index of the input sequence to the first index (index 0) of the output sequence. All elements from the first index up to the second-to-last index of the input sequence are shifted one position to the right in the output sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is generated by applying the rotate_right_circularly action to the input_sequence.
