objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: NumPy array of integers (observed in execution) or list of integers
    properties:
      - ordered elements
      - fixed length (12 in training examples)
actions:
  - name: rotate_right
    input: sequence
    output: sequence (potentially list, requires conversion if input is NumPy array)
    description: Moves the last element of the input sequence to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right. Handles potential NumPy array input.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence (NumPy array or list)
    output: output_sequence (list)
    rule: output_sequence is the result of applying the rotate_right action to the input_sequence.
