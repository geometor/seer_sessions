The input and output sequences appear to contain the same set of numbers, but their order is different. Observing the examples reveals a consistent pattern: the last number in the input sequence becomes the first number in the output sequence, and all preceding numbers are shifted one position to the right. This operation is commonly known as a right circular shift or rotation.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
