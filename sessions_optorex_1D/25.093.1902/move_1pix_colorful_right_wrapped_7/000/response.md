*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single digits, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   Both input and output sequences have the same length (12 digits in all examples).
    *   The digits themselves are preserved; the transformation involves rearranging their order.
    *   Comparing input and output, the last digit of the input sequence appears at the beginning of the output sequence.
    *   The remaining digits from the input (all except the last one) appear in the output immediately after the relocated last digit, maintaining their original relative order.
    *   This pattern consistently describes a right cyclic shift or rotation of the sequence by one position.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list of integers
        properties:
          - ordered
          - fixed length (12 in examples)
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list of integers
        properties:
          - ordered
          - same length as input
          - contains the same elements as input
      - name: last_element
        type: integer
        description: The final element of the input_sequence.
      - name: remaining_elements
        type: list of integers
        description: The elements of the input_sequence excluding the last_element.

    actions:
      - name: identify_last_element
        input: input_sequence
        output: last_element
      - name: identify_remaining_elements
        input: input_sequence
        output: remaining_elements
      - name: prepend_element
        input: [element_to_prepend, target_sequence]
        output: new_sequence
        description: Places the element_to_prepend at the beginning of the target_sequence.

    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        description: The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by moving the last_element to the beginning.
        steps:
          - identify_last_element from input_sequence.
          - identify_remaining_elements from input_sequence.
          - prepend_element (last_element, remaining_elements) to form the output_sequence.
      - type: equivalence
        description: The transformation is equivalent to a right cyclic shift of the input_sequence by one position.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the last element in the input sequence.
    2.  Remove the last element from the input sequence.
    3.  Insert the removed element at the beginning of the modified sequence to produce the output sequence.
