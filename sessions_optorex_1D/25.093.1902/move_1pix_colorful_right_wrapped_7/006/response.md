*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis identified the transformation as a right cyclic shift by one position (moving the last element to the beginning of the sequence). The provided Python code correctly implements this logic using NumPy array manipulation. However, the execution results indicated mismatches for all training examples, reporting "Match: False" and non-zero "Pixels Off".
    A detailed re-examination of each input/output pair confirms that a right cyclic shift *does* produce the expected output in every single training case. Code execution simulating the string manipulation version of the right shift also confirms this.
    Therefore, the discrepancy likely originates not from incorrect logic but from the evaluation framework or potential format inconsistencies (e.g., how the NumPy array output is compared against the expected string output, or subtle spacing differences). The core transformation rule appears sound. The strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the transformation as a right cyclic shift.

    1.  Read the input sequence of numbers.
    2.  Identify the element at the very end of the sequence.
    3.  Identify the subsequence containing all elements *except* the last one, preserving their order.
    4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last element at the beginning, followed immediately by the identified subsequence.
    5.  Format the output sequence as space-separated numbers.
