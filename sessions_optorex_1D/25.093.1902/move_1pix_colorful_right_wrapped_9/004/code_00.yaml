objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int] # or numpy.ndarray[int]
    description: The input sequence of integers.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int] # or numpy.ndarray[int]
    description: The transformed sequence of integers, having the same length as the input.
  - name: last_element
    type: int
    description: The integer value at the final position of the input_sequence.
  - name: base_sequence
    type: List[int] # or numpy.ndarray[int]
    description: The sequence containing all elements of input_sequence except the last one, preserving their original relative order.
properties:
  - object: last_element
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the last element.
  - object: base_sequence
    name: contains_non_zero
    type: bool
    description: Whether the base_sequence contains at least one non-zero element.
  - object: base_sequence
    name: first_non_zero_index
    type: int
    description: The index of the first element in the base_sequence that is not 0. Defaults to 0 if no non-zero element exists.
relationships:
  - type: decomposition
    source: input_sequence
    targets: [base_sequence, last_element]
    description: input_sequence is split into the base_sequence (all elements but the last) and the last_element.
actions:
  - name: determine_insertion_point
    description: Calculate the index where the last_element should be inserted into the base_sequence.
    condition: last_element == 0
    logic: Find the index of the first non-zero element in base_sequence. If none exists, use index 0.
    result: insertion_index (type: int)
  - name: determine_insertion_point
    description: Calculate the index where the last_element should be inserted into the base_sequence.
    condition: last_element != 0
    logic: Always use index 0.
    result: insertion_index (type: int, value: 0)
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create the output_sequence by inserting the last_element into the base_sequence at the determined insertion_index.
    inputs: [base_sequence, last_element, insertion_index]
    result: output_sequence
