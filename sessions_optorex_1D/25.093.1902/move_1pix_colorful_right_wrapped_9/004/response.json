            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe natural language program and the initial code logic correctly describe the transformation for all provided training examples. The error reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\") during the execution phase indicates an issue within the Python/NumPy implementation, likely related to how boolean conditions are evaluated on NumPy arrays, or potential type mismatches passed to NumPy functions within the testing environment, rather than a flaw in the discerned transformation rule itself.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the description of the transformation logic (YAML and Natural Language Program) for clarity and precision, confirming that the derived rule consistently explains the examples. The coding phase will need to address the specific implementation error, ensuring robust type handling and correct usage of NumPy functions like `np.nonzero` and `np.insert`, possibly by adding explicit checks or conversions.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nA manual review confirms the derived logic holds for all 7 training examples:\n\n*   **Examples with last element = 0 (train_1, train_3, train_6):** The rule is to insert the 0 before the first non-zero element of the preceding sequence (or at the start if all preceding elements are 0).\n    *   train_1: `... 0]` -> Insert 0 at index 4 (before 1) -> `... 0 1 ...` -> Correct.\n    *   train_3: `... 0]` -> Insert 0 at index 6 (before 4) -> `... 0 4 ...` -> Correct.\n    *   train_6: `... 0]` -> Insert 0 at index 2 (before 1) -> `... 0 1 ...` -> Correct.\n*   **Examples with last element != 0 (train_2, train_4, train_5, train_7):** The rule is to move the last element to the very beginning (index 0) of the sequence.\n    *   train_2: `... 7]` -> Move 7 to index 0 -> `[7 ...]` -> Correct.\n    *   train_4: `... 4]` -> Move 4 to index 0 -> `[4 ...]` -> Correct.\n    *   train_5: `... 9]` -> Move 9 to index 0 -> `[9 ...]` -> Correct.\n    *   train_7: `... 9]` -> Move 9 to index 0 -> `[9 ...]` -> Correct.\n\nThe previously described logic consistently explains all provided input/output pairs.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
