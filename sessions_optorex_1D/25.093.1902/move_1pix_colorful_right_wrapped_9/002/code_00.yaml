objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int] | np.ndarray[int] # Accepts list or numpy array
    description: The input sequence of integers.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int] | np.ndarray[int] # Outputs in the same format as input potentially
    description: The transformed sequence of integers.
  - name: last_element
    type: int
    description: The integer value at the last position of the input_sequence.
  - name: base_sequence
    type: List[int] | np.ndarray[int]
    description: The input_sequence excluding its last element, maintaining relative order.
properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    name: length
    description: Number of elements in the input sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    name: length
    description: Number of elements in the output sequence (always equals input length).
  - object: last_element
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the last element (specifically whether it is 0 or not).
  - object: base_sequence
    name: first_non_zero_index
    description: >
      The index of the first element in the base_sequence that is not 0.
      If all elements are 0 or the sequence is empty, this index is considered 0.
relationships:
  - type: derivation
    source: input_sequence
    target: last_element
    description: last_element is the final item in input_sequence.
  - type: derivation
    source: input_sequence
    target: base_sequence
    description: base_sequence consists of all elements of input_sequence except the last one.
actions:
  - name: separate_last_element
    source: input_sequence
    result: base_sequence, last_element
    description: Divide the input_sequence into the last_element and the remaining base_sequence.
  - name: determine_insertion_point
    source: base_sequence, last_element
    result: insertion_index
    condition: last_element.value == 0
    description: >
      If last_element is 0, find the index of the first non-zero element
      in base_sequence. Return 0 if no non-zero element exists or if base_sequence is empty.
    condition_else: last_element.value != 0
    description_else: If last_element is not 0, the insertion_index is 0.
  - name: construct_output
    source: base_sequence, last_element, insertion_index
    result: output_sequence
    description: >
      Insert the last_element into the base_sequence at the determined
      insertion_index to produce the output_sequence. If last_element was non-zero,
      insertion_index is 0. If last_element was 0, insertion_index is the
      first_non_zero_index (or 0 if applicable).
