objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray (1D)
    description: The input sequence of integers.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray (1D)
    description: The transformed sequence of integers, having the same length as the input.
  - name: last_element
    type: int (scalar)
    description: The integer value at the final position of the input_sequence.
  - name: base_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray (1D)
    description: The sequence containing all elements of input_sequence *except* the last one, preserving relative order.
properties:
  - object: last_element
    name: value
    description: The numerical value of the last element. Crucially determines the transformation path (0 vs. non-zero).
  - object: base_sequence
    name: first_non_zero_index
    description: >
      The index of the first element within the base_sequence that has a value
      other than 0. If all elements are 0, or the sequence is empty, this conceptual
      index is 0.
relationships:
  - type: extraction
    source: input_sequence
    target: last_element
    description: last_element is the scalar integer value found at the last index of input_sequence.
  - type: extraction
    source: input_sequence
    target: base_sequence
    description: base_sequence comprises all elements of input_sequence from the beginning up to (but not including) the last element.
actions:
  - name: separate_input
    source: input_sequence
    results: last_element, base_sequence
    description: Divide the input_sequence into its final element and the preceding sequence.
  - name: determine_insertion_logic
    based_on: last_element.value
    outcomes:
      - condition: last_element == 0
        action: find_insertion_point_for_zero
      - condition: last_element != 0
        action: set_insertion_point_to_zero
  - name: find_insertion_point_for_zero
    source: base_sequence
    result: insertion_index (int)
    description: >
      Calculate the index for inserting the zero. This is the index of the first
      non-zero element in base_sequence. If no non-zero element exists, the index is 0.
  - name: set_insertion_point_to_zero
    result: insertion_index (int)
    description: Set the insertion index to 0.
  - name: construct_output
    source: base_sequence
    inputs: last_element, insertion_index
    result: output_sequence
    description: >
      Create the output_sequence by inserting the scalar value of last_element
      into the base_sequence at the determined insertion_index.
