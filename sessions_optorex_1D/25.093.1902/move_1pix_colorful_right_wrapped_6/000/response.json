The length of the sequence appears consistent within each example pair. Comparing the input and output sequences reveals a consistent pattern: the last element of the input sequence is moved to the beginning of the sequence, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right to accommodate the moved element. This operation is commonly known as a right circular shift or rotation.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
