task_elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - contains: integers # Represented as strings initially
      - ordered: true
      - delimited_by: space
      - length: 12 # Consistent across all provided examples
  - name: element
    type: integer # Represented as string in input/output format
    properties:
      - single_digit: true # Observed in examples

input_object:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence

output_object:
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence
    derivation: Derived from input_sequence via a specific transformation.

actions:
  - name: circular_shift_right
    description: Moves the last element of a sequence to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - sequence (transformed)

transformation_rule:
  name: Apply Right Circular Shift
  input: input_sequence
  output: output_sequence
  steps:
    - Step 1: Identify the last element of the input_sequence.
    - Step 2: Identify the sub-sequence containing all elements except the last one (prefix).
    - Step 3: Construct the output_sequence by prepending the identified last element to the prefix sub-sequence.

execution_notes:
  - The provided execution results indicate a failure to apply the identified transformation rule.
  - The actual output matched the input in all test cases, suggesting a potential issue in the specific code implementation (e.g., data type handling, logical error in the tested variant) or the testing environment.
  - The transformation rule described (circular_shift_right) remains the most consistent explanation for the relationship between the *given* input and *expected* output pairs.
