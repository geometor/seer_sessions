actions:
  - name: circular_shift_right_numpy
    description: Moves the last element of a 1D NumPy array to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.
    inputs:
      - input_array
    outputs:
      - output_array

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_array
    to: output_array
    rule: apply circular_shift_right_numpy
  - type: element_position
    description: The element at index -1 (last) of the input_array becomes the element at index 0 of the output_array.
  - type: element_position
    description: Each element at index 'i' (where 0 <= i < N-1) in the input_array moves to index 'i+1' in the output_array.
  - type: shape_preservation
    description: The shape and dtype of the output_array are the same as the input_array.
