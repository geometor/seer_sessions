**Perception of the Elements:**

The input and output are both sequences of 12 integers. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the last element of the input sequence is moved to the beginning of the sequence, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right to accommodate this change. This operation is equivalent to a right rotation of the sequence by one position.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  elements:
    type: integer
    count: 12
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements:
    type: integer
    count: 12
Transformation:
  action: right_rotation
  details: The sequence is rotated one position to the right.
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The last element of the input sequence becomes the first element of the output sequence.
  - Elements from index 0 to index 10 of the input sequence become elements from index 1 to index 11 of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the last element in the input sequence.
2.  Create a new sequence starting with this last element.
3.  Append all elements from the input sequence, except the last one, to the new sequence in their original relative order.
4.  The resulting sequence is the output.
