Input:
  type: sequence
  elements:
    type: integer
    count: 12
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements:
    type: integer
    count: 12
Transformation:
  action: right_rotation
  details: The sequence is rotated one position to the right.
Relationship:
  - The output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence.
  - The last element of the input sequence becomes the first element of the output sequence.
  - Elements from index 0 to index 10 of the input sequence become elements from index 1 to index 11 of the output sequence, maintaining their relative order.
