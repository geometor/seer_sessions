By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the last element of the input sequence is moved to the beginning of the sequence, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right to accommodate this change. This operation is equivalent to a right rotation of the sequence by one position.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
