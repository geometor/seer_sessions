Input:
  type: sequence
  elements:
    type: integer
    count: 12
  structure: ordered list or array
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements:
    type: integer
    count: 12
  structure: ordered list or array
Transformation:
  name: Right Rotation
  action: move_element
  source_index: last (index 11)
  destination_index: first (index 0)
  action: shift_elements
  source_indices: 0 through 10
  destination_indices: 1 through 11
  direction: right
  amount: 1 position
Relationship:
  - The output sequence contains the same elements as the input sequence but in a different order.
  - The last element of the input sequence becomes the first element of the output sequence.
  - All other elements from the input sequence are shifted one position to the right to form the remaining elements of the output sequence, preserving their relative order.
