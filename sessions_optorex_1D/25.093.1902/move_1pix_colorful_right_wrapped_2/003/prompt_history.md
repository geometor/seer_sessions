**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of integers. Both the input and output are sequences of the same length (12 integers in all provided examples). The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a rotation or cyclic shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (in examples)
        - elements: individual integers
        - last_element: the integer at the final position
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (in examples, same as input)
        - elements: individual integers derived from InputSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence via transformation.
  - The first element of OutputSequence corresponds to the last element of InputSequence.
  - The elements from the second position to the end of OutputSequence correspond to the elements from the first position to the second-to-last position of InputSequence, maintaining their relative order.
Actions:
  - Identify the last element of the InputSequence.
  - Remove the last element from the InputSequence.
  - Prepend the identified last element to the beginning of the remaining InputSequence elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify and isolate the last element of the sequence.
3.  Take the sub-sequence containing all elements *except* the last one.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the isolated last element at the beginning, followed by the elements of the sub-sequence in their original order.
```python
import numpy as np

    d = deque(int(x) for x in input_sequence_str.split())

    # Check if the deque is empty, return empty if so (edge case)
    if not d:
        return "" # Or handle as appropriate, maybe raise error or return empty list/deque

    # Perform the rotation: move the last element to the front
    # Option 1: Using deque's rotate method
    d.rotate(1) 
    
    # Option 2: Manual pop and appendleft (equivalent logic)
    # last_element = d.pop() # Remove the last element

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The provided execution results indicate a consistent failure across all examples. The error message, `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`, clearly points to an incorrect assumption about the input data type in the previous `transform` function. The function expected a string (`input_sequence_str`) and tried to use the `.split()` method, but it actually received a NumPy array.

The strategy is straightforward:
1.  Acknowledge that the input is a sequence of numerical data (likely a list of integers or a NumPy array), not a string.
2.  Verify that the core transformation logic (moving the last element to the first position, a right cyclic shift) still holds true for all examples, despite the type error. Visual inspection confirms this pattern is consistent across all provided training pairs.
3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the correct input type assumption and maintain the description of the transformation rule. The next iteration of the code should handle a list or array directly.

**Metrics:**

*   **Execution Status:** All 7 training examples and the 1 test example failed execution.
*   **Error Type:** Consistent `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.
*   **Root Cause:** The `transform` function attempted to call `.split()` on the input, assuming it was a string, while the actual input provided by the execution environment was a NumPy array.
*   **Input Data Type (Inferred):** `numpy.ndarray` (or potentially a standard Python list of integers).
*   **Input Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all examples.
*   **Output Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all examples.
*   **Transformation Pattern (Visual Check):** In all examples, the output is formed by taking the last element of the input sequence and placing it at the beginning, shifting all other elements one position to the right. This corresponds to a right cyclic shift or rotation by one position.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Right Cyclic Shift
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list or numpy.ndarray # Updated type assumption
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (observed in examples, may generalize)
        - elements: ordered integers
        - last_element: the integer at the final index
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list or numpy.ndarray # Consistent with input type
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: Same as InputSequence (12 in examples)
        - elements: rearranged integers from InputSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence via a specific rearrangement.
  - The first element of OutputSequence is identical to the last element of InputSequence.
  - The elements from the second position onwards in OutputSequence are identical to the elements from the first position to the second-to-last position of InputSequence, preserving their relative order.
Actions:
  - Receive the InputSequence (as a list or array of integers).
  - Identify and isolate the last element of the InputSequence.
  - Create a new sequence containing elements from the start of the InputSequence up to (but not including) the last element.
  - Construct the OutputSequence by prepending the isolated last element to this new sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (represented as a list or array).
2.  Identify the element located at the last position of the input sequence.
3.  Create a new sequence by taking all elements from the input sequence *except* the last one, maintaining their original relative order.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last element at the very beginning, followed immediately by the sequence created in step 3.
5.  Return the resulting output sequence.
