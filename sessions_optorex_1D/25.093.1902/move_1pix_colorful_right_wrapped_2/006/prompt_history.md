**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of integers. Both the input and output are sequences of the same length (12 integers in all provided examples). The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a rotation or cyclic shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (in examples)
        - elements: individual integers
        - last_element: the integer at the final position
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (in examples, same as input)
        - elements: individual integers derived from InputSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence via transformation.
  - The first element of OutputSequence corresponds to the last element of InputSequence.
  - The elements from the second position to the end of OutputSequence correspond to the elements from the first position to the second-to-last position of InputSequence, maintaining their relative order.
Actions:
  - Identify the last element of the InputSequence.
  - Remove the last element from the InputSequence.
  - Prepend the identified last element to the beginning of the remaining InputSequence elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify and isolate the last element of the sequence.
3.  Take the sub-sequence containing all elements *except* the last one.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the isolated last element at the beginning, followed by the elements of the sub-sequence in their original order.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

def transform(input_sequence_str):
    """
    Transforms an input sequence of integers by moving the last element 
    to the first position, effectively performing a right cyclic rotation 
    by one position.

    1. Take the input sequence of integers.
    2. Identify and isolate the last element of the sequence.
    3. Take the sub-sequence containing all elements *except* the last one.

Transforms an input sequence of integers by moving the last element 
to the first position, effectively performing a right cyclic rotation 
by one position.

1. Receive the input sequence of integers (represented as a list or array).
2. Identify the element located at the last position of the input sequence.
3. Create a new sequence by taking all elements from the input sequence *except* the last one, maintaining their original relative order.
4. Construct the output sequence by placing the identified last element at the very beginning, followed immediately by the sequence created in step 3.
5. Return the resulting output sequence.
