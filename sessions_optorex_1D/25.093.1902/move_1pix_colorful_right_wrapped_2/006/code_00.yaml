Task: Sequence Right Cyclic Shift
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: n (12 in examples)
        - elements: ordered sequence of integers
        - last_element: The integer at index n-1
        - initial_subsequence: The ordered sequence of integers from index 0 to n-2
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: n (same as input)
        - elements: derived from InputSequence via rearrangement
        - first_element: The integer that was the last_element of InputSequence
        - final_subsequence: The sequence of integers from index 1 to n-1, identical to the initial_subsequence of InputSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is a rearrangement of InputSequence.
  - The number and type of elements are preserved between InputSequence and OutputSequence.
  - The transformation rule maps InputSequence to OutputSequence.
Actions:
  - Identify the last element of the InputSequence.
  - Identify the subsequence containing all elements *except* the last one (from index 0 to n-2).
  - Construct the OutputSequence by concatenating the identified last element (as the new first element) with the identified subsequence.
