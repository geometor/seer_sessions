Task: Right Cyclic Sequence Shift
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: variable (12 in examples)
        - elements: ordered sequence of integers
        - last_element: the integer at the final index
        - initial_subsequence: the sequence containing all elements except the last one
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: same as InputSequence
        - elements: integers from InputSequence, rearranged
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence by rearranging elements.
  - The first element of OutputSequence is identical to the last_element of InputSequence.
  - The elements of OutputSequence starting from the second position are identical to the initial_subsequence of InputSequence, preserving their relative order.
Action:
  - Perform a right cyclic shift (rotation) of the InputSequence by one position.
Steps:
  1. Identify the last element of the InputSequence.
  2. Isolate the subsequence containing all elements *before* the last element.
  3. Construct the OutputSequence by concatenating the last element (from step 1) followed by the subsequence (from step 2).
