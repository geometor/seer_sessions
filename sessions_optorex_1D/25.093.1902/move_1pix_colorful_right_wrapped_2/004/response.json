            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided test results indicate a consistent failure across all examples. In every case, the `Transformed Output` generated by the evaluated code (`code_00.py`) is identical to the original `Input`. However, the `Expected Output` in every example clearly shows the result of moving the last element of the `Input` sequence to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right (a right cyclic shift).\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that the code, as executed in the testing environment, did not perform the intended transformation. The logic described in the previous Natural Language Program and implemented using `deque.rotate(1)` accurately reflects the pattern seen between the `Input` and `Expected Output`. Therefore, the issue likely lies not in the understanding of the transformation rule itself, but potentially in the implementation details within the function or how the function was called and its output processed during testing.\n\nThe strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule based on the consistent pattern observed in the `Input` -> `Expected Output` pairs and refine the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to describe this rule accurately, acknowledging that the prior code execution failed to match the expectation.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nThe core transformation observed across all `train_` examples and the `test_1` example is a **right cyclic shift by one position**.\n\nLet's verify this pattern for each example:\n\n*   **train_1:** Input `... 9 1` -> Expected Output `1 ... 9`. (Last element '1' moved to front).\n*   **train_2:** Input `... 0 5` -> Expected Output `5 ... 0`. (Last element '5' moved to front).\n*   **train_3:** Input `... 3 1` -> Expected Output `1 ... 3`. (Last element '1' moved to front).\n*   **train_4:** Input `... 6 6` -> Expected Output `6 ... 6`. (Last element '6' moved to front).\n*   **train_5:** Input `... 9 3` -> Expected Output `3 ... 9`. (Last element '3' moved to front).\n*   **train_6:** Input `... 3 5` -> Expected Output `5 ... 3`. (Last element '5' moved to front).\n*   **train_7:** Input `... 0 1` -> Expected Output `1 ... 0`. (Last element '1' moved to front).\n*   **test_1:** Input `... 0 4` -> Expected Output `4 ... 0`. (Last element '4' moved to front).\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation rule is consistently a right cyclic shift by one position. The failure reported in the results stems from the executed code not performing this shift, outputting the input sequence unchanged instead.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
