**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of integers. Both the input and output are sequences of the same length (12 integers in all provided examples). The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a rotation or cyclic shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (in examples)
        - elements: individual integers
        - last_element: the integer at the final position
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (in examples, same as input)
        - elements: individual integers derived from InputSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence via transformation.
  - The first element of OutputSequence corresponds to the last element of InputSequence.
  - The elements from the second position to the end of OutputSequence correspond to the elements from the first position to the second-to-last position of InputSequence, maintaining their relative order.
Actions:
  - Identify the last element of the InputSequence.
  - Remove the last element from the InputSequence.
  - Prepend the identified last element to the beginning of the remaining InputSequence elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify and isolate the last element of the sequence.
3.  Take the sub-sequence containing all elements *except* the last one.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the isolated last element at the beginning, followed by the elements of the sub-sequence in their original order.
