**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating a sequence of integers. Both the input and output are sequences of the same length (12 integers in all provided examples). The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, it looks like a rotation or cyclic shift.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (in examples)
        - elements: individual integers
        - last_element: the integer at the final position
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (in examples, same as input)
        - elements: individual integers derived from InputSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence via transformation.
  - The first element of OutputSequence corresponds to the last element of InputSequence.
  - The elements from the second position to the end of OutputSequence correspond to the elements from the first position to the second-to-last position of InputSequence, maintaining their relative order.
Actions:
  - Identify the last element of the InputSequence.
  - Remove the last element from the InputSequence.
  - Prepend the identified last element to the beginning of the remaining InputSequence elements.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Take the input sequence of integers.
2.  Identify and isolate the last element of the sequence.
3.  Take the sub-sequence containing all elements *except* the last one.
4.  Construct the output sequence by placing the isolated last element at the beginning, followed by the elements of the sub-sequence in their original order.
```python
import numpy as np
from collections import deque

def transform(input_sequence_str):
    """
    Transforms an input sequence of integers by moving the last element 
    to the first position, effectively performing a right cyclic rotation 
    by one position.

    1. Take the input sequence of integers.
    2. Identify and isolate the last element of the sequence.
    3. Take the sub-sequence containing all elements *except* the last one.
    4. Construct the output sequence by placing the isolated last element 
       at the beginning, followed by the elements of the sub-sequence 
       in their original order.
    """

    # Parse the input string into a list of integers
    # Using deque for efficient rotation/append/pop operations, though list slicing is also clear
    # input_list = [int(x) for x in input_sequence_str.split()]
    d = deque(int(x) for x in input_sequence_str.split())

    # Check if the deque is empty, return empty if so (edge case)
    if not d:
        return "" # Or handle as appropriate, maybe raise error or return empty list/deque

    # Perform the rotation: move the last element to the front
    # Option 1: Using deque's rotate method
    d.rotate(1) 
    
    # Option 2: Manual pop and appendleft (equivalent logic)
    # last_element = d.pop() # Remove the last element
    # d.appendleft(last_element) # Add it to the beginning

    # Convert the deque back to a space-separated string for output
    output_sequence_str = " ".join(map(str, d))

    return output_sequence_str
