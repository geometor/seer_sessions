            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided execution results indicate a consistent failure across all examples. The error message, `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`, clearly points to an incorrect assumption about the input data type in the previous `transform` function. The function expected a string (`input_sequence_str`) and tried to use the `.split()` method, but it actually received a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy is straightforward:\n1.  Acknowledge that the input is a sequence of numerical data (likely a list of integers or a NumPy array), not a string.\n2.  Verify that the core transformation logic (moving the last element to the first position, a right cyclic shift) still holds true for all examples, despite the type error. Visual inspection confirms this pattern is consistent across all provided training pairs.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to reflect the correct input type assumption and maintain the description of the transformation rule. The next iteration of the code should handle a list or array directly.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Execution Status:** All 7 training examples and the 1 test example failed execution.\n*   **Error Type:** Consistent `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.\n*   **Root Cause:** The `transform` function attempted to call `.split()` on the input, assuming it was a string, while the actual input provided by the execution environment was a NumPy array.\n*   **Input Data Type (Inferred):** `numpy.ndarray` (or potentially a standard Python list of integers).\n*   **Input Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all examples.\n*   **Output Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 elements in all examples.\n*   **Transformation Pattern (Visual Check):** In all examples, the output is formed by taking the last element of the input sequence and placing it at the beginning, shifting all other elements one position to the right. This corresponds to a right cyclic shift or rotation by one position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
