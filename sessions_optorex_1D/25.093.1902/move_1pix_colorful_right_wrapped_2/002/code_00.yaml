Task: Sequence Right Cyclic Shift
Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: list or numpy.ndarray # Updated type assumption
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: 12 (observed in examples, may generalize)
        - elements: ordered integers
        - last_element: the integer at the final index
  - OutputSequence:
      type: list or numpy.ndarray # Consistent with input type
      element_type: integer
      properties:
        - length: Same as InputSequence (12 in examples)
        - elements: rearranged integers from InputSequence
Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence via a specific rearrangement.
  - The first element of OutputSequence is identical to the last element of InputSequence.
  - The elements from the second position onwards in OutputSequence are identical to the elements from the first position to the second-to-last position of InputSequence, preserving their relative order.
Actions:
  - Receive the InputSequence (as a list or array of integers).
  - Identify and isolate the last element of the InputSequence.
  - Create a new sequence containing elements from the start of the InputSequence up to (but not including) the last element.
  - Construct the OutputSequence by prepending the isolated last element to this new sequence.
