*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of digits, separated by spaces.
    *   Each sequence appears to have the same length (12 digits in all provided examples).
    *   The digits themselves seem to be the same between the input and output, but their order is different.
    *   Comparing the input and output sequences, the last digit of the input consistently becomes the first digit of the output.
    *   The remaining digits from the input (the first n-1 digits) are shifted one position to the right in the output.
    *   This operation is consistent with a right circular shift (or rotation) of the sequence by one position.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - name: digit_sequence
        properties:
          - type: list/array of integers
          - elements: single digits (0-9)
          - length: fixed (12 in examples)
    actions:
      - name: rotate_right
        input: digit_sequence
        output: transformed_digit_sequence
        steps:
          - identify the last element of the input sequence
          - identify the sub-sequence containing all elements except the last one
          - construct the output sequence by placing the last element at the beginning
          - append the sub-sequence (from step 2) after the moved element
    relationships:
      - The output sequence is a one-position right circular shift of the input sequence.
      - The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence.
      - All digits present in the input sequence are also present in the output sequence, and vice versa, with the same frequencies.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Remove the last digit from the sequence.
    3.  Insert the removed digit at the beginning of the remaining sequence.
    4.  The resulting sequence is the output.
