**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 digits into another sequence of 12 digits. By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the transformation appears to be a circular right shift by one position. The last digit in the input sequence becomes the first digit in the output sequence, and all other digits are shifted one position to the right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: digits (0-9)

actions:
  - name: shift_right_circular
    input: input_sequence (sequence)
    output: output_sequence (sequence)
    description: Moves the last element of the input sequence to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is the result of applying a single circular right shift to the input sequence.
      - The element at index 11 of the input becomes the element at index 0 of the output.
      - The element at index `i` (where 0 <= i < 11) of the input becomes the element at index `i+1` of the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the last digit in the input sequence.
3.  Create a new sequence containing all digits from the input sequence *except* the last one.
4.  Place the identified last digit at the beginning of this new sequence.
5.  Output the resulting 12-digit sequence.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object
**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed execution on all examples, both training and test sets. The error message `TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like object` consistently indicates that the `transform` function received input as a `bytes` object, while the regular expression function `re.findall` was expecting a standard string (`str`).

The core transformation logic identified in the previous step (circular right shift) appears sound based on the visual inspection of input/output pairs. The failure is purely technical due to an incorrect assumption about the input data type.

The strategy to resolve this is straightforward: modify the `transform` function to correctly handle `bytes` input. This typically involves decoding the `bytes` object into a string using an appropriate encoding (e.g., 'utf-8') before applying the string-based operations like `re.findall` and `.join()`.

**Metrics:**

Due to the immediate `TypeError`, the code did not execute the transformation logic. Therefore, metrics related to the accuracy of the shift operation cannot be gathered at this stage. The primary observation is:

*   **Input Type:** The input provided to the `transform` function is consistently `bytes`, not `str`.
*   **Error Consistency:** The same `TypeError` occurred across all 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the results log.
