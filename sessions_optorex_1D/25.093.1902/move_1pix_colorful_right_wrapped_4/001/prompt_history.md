**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 digits into another sequence of 12 digits. By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the transformation appears to be a circular right shift by one position. The last digit in the input sequence becomes the first digit in the output sequence, and all other digits are shifted one position to the right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: digits (0-9)

actions:
  - name: shift_right_circular
    input: input_sequence (sequence)
    output: output_sequence (sequence)
    description: Moves the last element of the input sequence to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is the result of applying a single circular right shift to the input sequence.
      - The element at index 11 of the input becomes the element at index 0 of the output.
      - The element at index `i` (where 0 <= i < 11) of the input becomes the element at index `i+1` of the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
2.  Identify the last digit in the input sequence.
3.  Create a new sequence containing all digits from the input sequence *except* the last one.
4.  Place the identified last digit at the beginning of this new sequence.
5.  Output the resulting 12-digit sequence.
