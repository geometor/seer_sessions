**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 digits into another sequence of 12 digits. By comparing the input and output sequences across multiple examples, a consistent pattern emerges: the transformation appears to be a circular right shift by one position. The last digit in the input sequence becomes the first digit in the output sequence, and all other digits are shifted one position to the right.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: digits (0-9)

actions:
  - name: shift_right_circular
    input: input_sequence (sequence)
    output: output_sequence (sequence)
    description: Moves the last element of the input sequence to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is the result of applying a single circular right shift to the input sequence.
      - The element at index 11 of the input becomes the element at index 0 of the output.
      - The element at index `i` (where 0 <= i < 11) of the input becomes the element at index `i+1` of the output.
```

3.  Create a new sequence containing all digits from the input sequence *except* the last one.
4.  Place the identified last digit at the beginning of this new sequence.
5.  Output the resulting 12-digit sequence.

## Example 1:
Error: Input must be bytes or string, received <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
**Assessment:**

The error message `TypeError: Input must be bytes or string, received <class 'numpy.ndarray'>` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was called with an unexpected input type. The function was designed based on the initial string representation of the examples, anticipating string or byte string inputs. However, the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array.

The core transformation logic (circular right shift) identified in the initial analysis appears correct based on the visual comparison of input/output pairs. The strategy to resolve the errors is to modify the input handling part of the function to accept NumPy arrays directly and perform the shift operation using NumPy array manipulations. The output format should also be adjusted to return a NumPy array, assuming the testing framework expects this format.

**Metrics:**

The error occurred consistently across all 7 training examples and the single test example provided in the results.

*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (inferred from error messages)
*   **Input Shape:** (12,) (inferred from examples)
*   **Input Data Type (elements):** Integers (inferred from examples)
*   **Output Type (Expected):** Likely `numpy.ndarray` based on the input type.
*   **Transformation:** Circular right shift by 1 position.
*   **Error Type:** `TypeError` due to input data type mismatch in the function signature/handling.
*   **Error Consistency:** 100% of examples failed with the same error.

2.  Extract the last element (at index 11) from the input array.
3.  Extract the first 11 elements (from index 0 to 10) from the input array.
4.  Construct the output NumPy array by placing the extracted last element at the beginning (index 0) and appending the extracted first 11 elements after it.
