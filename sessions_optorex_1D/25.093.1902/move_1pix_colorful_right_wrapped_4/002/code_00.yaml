objects:
  - name: byte_sequence
    type: bytes
    description: Input data representing a sequence of 12 digits, likely space-separated, encoded as bytes.
  - name: digit_list
    type: list of strings
    description: An intermediate representation derived from the input, containing individual digits as strings.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: string
    description: The final transformed sequence of 12 digits, space-separated, represented as a standard string.

actions:
  - name: decode_bytes
    input: byte_sequence (bytes)
    output: decoded_string (string)
    description: Converts the input byte sequence into a standard string using an appropriate encoding (e.g., 'utf-8').
  - name: parse_digits
    input: decoded_string (string)
    output: digit_list (list of strings)
    description: Extracts the individual digit characters from the decoded string.
  - name: shift_right_circular
    input: digit_list (list of strings)
    output: shifted_digit_list (list of strings)
    description: Moves the last element of the digit list to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.
  - name: format_output
    input: shifted_digit_list (list of strings)
    output: output_sequence (string)
    description: Joins the digits in the shifted list back into a single space-separated string.

relationships:
  - type: transformation_pipeline
    steps:
      - decode_bytes(input: byte_sequence) -> decoded_string
      - parse_digits(input: decoded_string) -> digit_list
      - shift_right_circular(input: digit_list) -> shifted_digit_list
      - format_output(input: shifted_digit_list) -> output_sequence
    description: The overall transformation process involves decoding the input, parsing digits, performing a circular right shift, and formatting the result as a string.
