objects:
  - name: grid
    type: 2D NumPy array
    properties:
      - shape: (1, 12) # 1 row, 12 columns
      - dtype: integer
      - elements: digits (0-9)

actions:
  - name: shift_row_right_circular
    input: input_grid (grid)
    output: output_grid (grid)
    description: >
      Performs a circular right shift on the elements within the single row
      of the input grid. The last element in the row moves to the first
      position in the row, and all other elements shift one position to the right.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_grid
    output: output_grid
    rule: >
      The output grid is derived from the input grid by applying a single
      circular right shift to the elements along the second axis (columns).
      - The element at index (0, 11) of the input becomes the element at index (0, 0) of the output.
      - The element at index (0, i) (where 0 <= i < 11) of the input becomes the element at index (0, i+1) of the output.
      - The shape of the grid (1, 12) remains unchanged.
