However, it incorrectly assumed the input data structure was a 1-dimensional sequence or array. The execution results consistently show `ValueError: Input array must be 1-dimensional, received 2 dimensions`, indicating that the input is actually a 2-dimensional NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy is to re-examine the input/output examples, confirming they are 2D arrays (likely with shape (1, 12)), and adapt the transformation logic and natural language program accordingly. The circular right shift operation needs to be applied along the second axis (columns) of the 2D array.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's inspect the shape of the input and output data for the first training example to confirm the dimensionality.\n"
