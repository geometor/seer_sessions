objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: digits (0-9)

actions:
  - name: shift_right_circular
    input: input_sequence (sequence)
    output: output_sequence (sequence)
    description: Moves the last element of the input sequence to the first position, shifting all other elements one position to the right.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is the result of applying a single circular right shift to the input sequence.
      - The element at index 11 of the input becomes the element at index 0 of the output.
      - The element at index `i` (where 0 <= i < 11) of the input becomes the element at index `i+1` of the output.
