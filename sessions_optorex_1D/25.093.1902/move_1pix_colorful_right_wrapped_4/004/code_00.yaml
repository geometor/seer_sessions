objects:
  - name: input_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - dtype: int (assumed based on digit values)
      - shape: (12,)
      - elements: integers representing digits
  - name: output_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - dtype: int (assumed based on input and transformation)
      - shape: (12,)
      - elements: integers representing digits after transformation

actions:
  - name: shift_right_circular_numpy
    input: input_array (numpy.ndarray)
    output: output_array (numpy.ndarray)
    description: Performs a circular right shift on the input NumPy array. The last element is moved to the first position, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    input: input_array
    output: output_array
    rule: The output array is derived from the input array by applying a single circular right shift using NumPy array manipulation.
      - The element at index 11 of the input array becomes the element at index 0 of the output array.
      - Elements from index 0 to 10 of the input array become elements at index 1 to 11 of the output array, respectively.
