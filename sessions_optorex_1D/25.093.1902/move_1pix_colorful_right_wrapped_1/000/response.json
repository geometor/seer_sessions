            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single digits represented as integers.\n*   **Structure:** The sequences seem to have a fixed length (12 elements in all examples).\n*   **Content:** The sequences contain digits from 0 to 9.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to rearrange the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the last element of the input sequence is moved to a new position earlier in the sequence, causing the intermediate elements to shift one position to the right to accommodate it.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\nComparing input and output pairs, we observe the following:\n\n1.  The last element of the input list is identified.\n2.  This last element is removed from its original position.\n3.  The position where this element is re-inserted seems related to the location of the first non-zero element in the original input list.\n    *   In `train_1` (`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 1, 6, 8, 0]`), the last element `0` is moved to index 6, which is the index of the first non-zero element `4`.\n    *   In `train_2` (`[4, 8, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`), the last element `0` is moved to index 0, which is the index of the first non-zero element `4`.\n    *   In `train_6` (`[3, 1, 6, 1, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7]`), the last element `7` is moved to index 0, which is the index of the first non-zero element `3`.\n    *   In `train_7` (`[4, 0, 8, 1, 7, 5, 4, 7, 4, 6, 6, 9]`), the last element `9` is moved to index 0, which is the index of the first non-zero element `4`.\n4.  The elements between the new insertion point and the original end of the list (exclusive of the last element) are shifted one position to the right.\n\n**Edge Case Consideration:**\n\n*   What if the list contains only zeros? The examples don't cover this. Following the derived rule, the \"first non-zero element\" wouldn't exist. A reasonable assumption might be to insert the last element (which is 0) at the beginning (index 0), resulting in no effective change to the list `[0, 0, ..., 0]`.\n*   What if the *only* non-zero element is the last element? Example: `[0, 0, 5]`. The last element is `5`. The first non-zero element is `5` at index 2. Removing `5` gives `[0, 0]`. Inserting `5` at index 2 gives `[0, 0, 5]`. Again, no effective change.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
