Data:
  Type: Sequence of integers
  Length: Fixed (appears to be 12 in examples)
  Elements: Digits (0-9)

Objects:
  - Name: Input Sequence
    Type: List of integers
  - Name: Output Sequence
    Type: List of integers
  - Name: Last Element
    Property: The integer value at the final index of the Input Sequence.
  - Name: First Non-Zero Element Position
    Property: The index of the first element in the Input Sequence that is not equal to 0. If all elements are 0, this position is considered index 0.

Action:
  Name: Rearrange Sequence
  Steps:
    1. Identify the Last Element of the Input Sequence.
    2. Determine the index of the First Non-Zero Element Position in the Input Sequence. Handle the all-zero case by using index 0.
    3. Create the Output Sequence by:
       a. Removing the Last Element from the Input Sequence.
       b. Inserting the identified Last Element at the determined First Non-Zero Element Position.

Relationship:
  - The Output Sequence is a permutation of the Input Sequence.
  - The position of the Last Element in the Output Sequence is determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the Input Sequence.
  - Elements originally between the target insertion point and the second-to-last position are shifted one index to the right in the Output Sequence.
