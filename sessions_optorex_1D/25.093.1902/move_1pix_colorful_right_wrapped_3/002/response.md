## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed because the code assumed the input was a string, leading to an `AttributeError` when `.split()` was called on a `numpy.ndarray`. The error messages consistently point to this type mismatch across all examples.

The core transformation logic identified previously (a right circular shift of the sequence by one position) appears correct, as confirmed by visually inspecting the input/output pairs and verified using `numpy.roll` in the metric gathering step below.

The strategy is to correct the implementation to accept a `numpy.ndarray` as input and use appropriate NumPy operations (like `numpy.roll` or array slicing) to perform the right circular shift.

## Gathered Metrics

The input data is consistently a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 12 integers. The output is also a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 12 integers. The transformation rule is confirmed to be a right circular shift (rotation) of the input array by one position.

Verification using `numpy.roll(input_array, 1)`:
*   **Example 1:** `np.roll([0 0 0 0 0 4 7 0 0 0 0 0], 1)` yields `[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 7 0 0 0 0]`, matching the output.
*   **Example 2:** `np.roll([6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0], 1)` yields `[0 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`, matching the output.
*   **Example 4:** `np.roll([3 0 0 5 1 4 5 7 2 5 3 1], 1)` yields `[1 3 0 0 5 1 4 5 7 2 5 3]`, matching the output.
*   **Example 7:** `np.roll([8 6 9 4 0 0 7 2 9 2 7 9], 1)` yields `[9 8 6 9 4 0 0 7 2 9 2 7]`, matching the output.

All provided examples conform to this right circular shift pattern.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Input_Data:
  - type: numpy.ndarray
    dtype: int
    shape: (12,)
    description: A 1-dimensional array containing 12 integers.
Output_Data:
  - type: numpy.ndarray
    dtype: int
    shape: (12,)
    description: A 1-dimensional array containing the same 12 integers as the input, but shifted.
Transformation:
  action: rotate_right_circular
  target: Input_Data array
  amount: 1 position
  method: The last element of the input array becomes the first element of the output array, and all preceding elements are shifted one position to the right. Equivalent to `numpy.roll(input_array, 1)`.
Relationships:
  - output_array[0] == input_array[-1]
  - output_array[1:] == input_array[:-1]
  - The set of elements in the input array is identical to the set of elements in the output array.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input, which is a 1-dimensional NumPy array containing 12 integers.
2.  Perform a right circular shift (rotation) on the input array by one position.
3.  Return the resulting NumPy array.
