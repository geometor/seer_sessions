The output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit integers, separated by spaces. Comparing the input and output sequences across all examples reveals that the numbers present in the input are exactly the same as the numbers in the output, and they maintain their relative order, but their positions within the sequence have changed. Specifically, the entire sequence appears to be shifted one position to the right, with the last element wrapping around to become the first element.\n\n## Documented Facts\n\n"
