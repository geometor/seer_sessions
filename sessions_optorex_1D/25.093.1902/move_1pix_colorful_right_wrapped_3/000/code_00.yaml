Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: list of integers
    length: 12
    elements: single digits (0-9)
Transformation:
  action: rotate_right
  target: entire input sequence
  amount: 1 position
Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a right circular shift of the input sequence by one position.
  - The last element of the input sequence becomes the first element of the output sequence.
  - All other elements from the input sequence are shifted one position to the right in the output sequence.
