## Perception of Task Elements

The input consists of a sequence of 12 single-digit integers, separated by spaces. The output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit integers, separated by spaces. Comparing the input and output sequences across all examples reveals that the numbers present in the input are exactly the same as the numbers in the output, and they maintain their relative order, but their positions within the sequence have changed. Specifically, the entire sequence appears to be shifted one position to the right, with the last element wrapping around to become the first element.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: list of integers
    length: 12
    elements: single digits (0-9)
Transformation:
  action: rotate_right
  target: entire input sequence
  amount: 1 position
Relationships:
  - Output sequence is a right circular shift of the input sequence by one position.
  - The last element of the input sequence becomes the first element of the output sequence.
  - All other elements from the input sequence are shifted one position to the right in the output sequence.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Take the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the last element of the sequence.
3.  Create a new sequence starting with the last element identified in step 2.
4.  Append all elements from the input sequence, *except* the last one, to the new sequence, maintaining their original relative order.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.

import collections

    # Format the output list back into a space-separated string
    output_str = " ".join(map(str, output_list))

    return output_str

## General Assessment

The previous attempt failed because the code assumed the input was a string, leading to an `AttributeError` when `.split()` was called on a `numpy.ndarray`. The error messages consistently point to this type mismatch across all examples.

The core transformation logic identified previously (a right circular shift of the sequence by one position) appears correct, as confirmed by visually inspecting the input/output pairs and verified using `numpy.roll` in the metric gathering step below.

The strategy is to correct the implementation to accept a `numpy.ndarray` as input and use appropriate NumPy operations (like `numpy.roll` or array slicing) to perform the right circular shift.

## Gathered Metrics

The input data is consistently a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 12 integers. The output is also a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 12 integers. The transformation rule is confirmed to be a right circular shift (rotation) of the input array by one position.

Verification using `numpy.roll(input_array, 1)`:
*   **Example 1:** `np.roll([0 0 0 0 0 4 7 0 0 0 0 0], 1)` yields `[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 7 0 0 0 0]`, matching the output.
*   **Example 2:** `np.roll([6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0], 1)` yields `[0 6 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`, matching the output.
*   **Example 4:** `np.roll([3 0 0 5 1 4 5 7 2 5 3 1], 1)` yields `[1 3 0 0 5 1 4 5 7 2 5 3]`, matching the output.
*   **Example 7:** `np.roll([8 6 9 4 0 0 7 2 9 2 7 9], 1)` yields `[9 8 6 9 4 0 0 7 2 9 2 7]`, matching the output.

All provided examples conform to this right circular shift pattern.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Input_Data:
  - type: numpy.ndarray
    dtype: int
    shape: (12,)
    description: A 1-dimensional array containing 12 integers.
Output_Data:
  - type: numpy.ndarray
    dtype: int
    shape: (12,)
    description: A 1-dimensional array containing the same 12 integers as the input, but shifted.
Transformation:
  action: rotate_right_circular
  target: Input_Data array
  amount: 1 position
  method: The last element of the input array becomes the first element of the output array, and all preceding elements are shifted one position to the right. Equivalent to `numpy.roll(input_array, 1)`.
Relationships:
  - output_array[0] == input_array[-1]
  - output_array[1:] == input_array[:-1]
  - The set of elements in the input array is identical to the set of elements in the output array.
```
