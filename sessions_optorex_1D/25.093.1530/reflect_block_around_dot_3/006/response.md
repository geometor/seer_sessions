**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided Python code attempts to implement the transformation rule observed in the initial examples. The core logic involves identifying a pivot element (2), a contiguous group block (X), calculating the gap (zeros) between them, and swapping the group block to the opposite side of the pivot while preserving the gap. Manual tracing confirms this logic correctly reproduces the input-output pairs for all provided training examples.

However, the code consistently fails during execution on all examples with the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This specific error strongly suggests that a NumPy boolean array is being used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., within an `if` statement).

Given that the manual trace verifies the intended logic and standard parsing methods produce 1D NumPy arrays (as confirmed by `tool_code`), the most likely causes for the error are:
1.  **Unexpected Input Format:** The testing environment might be passing the input `grid` to the `transform` function in an unexpected format (e.g., a 2D array `(1, N)`, an array of objects, etc.), which causes comparisons within the `_find_group_info` function to generate boolean arrays instead of scalar booleans.
2.  **Hidden Test Harness Interaction:** The error might occur within the test harness itself or due to an interaction between the harness and the NumPy operations, even if the `transform` function code appears correct in isolation for 1D integer array inputs.

**Strategy:**
The strategy is to refine the documentation (YAML facts, Natural Language Program) based on the confirmed logic derived from manual tracing, acknowledging the runtime error as a likely environmental or input format issue rather than a core logical flaw in the transformation rule itself. The description will focus on the successful pattern observed across all examples: the gap-preserving swap of the group block around the fixed pivot.

**Metrics**

The following metrics were derived by manually applying the identified transformation logic to each example:

| Example | Input Length | Pivot Index | Group Value | Group Indices (Input) | Group Length | Relative Position (Input) | Gap Size (Zeros) | Group Indices (Output) |

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Task: Rearrange a sequence by swapping a group block around a pivot, preserving the gap.
Input:
  Type: 1D sequence (List or NumPy array) of single-digit integers.
  Constraints:
    - Contains exactly one instance of the integer 2 (Pivot).
    - Contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (X), where X is not 2 (Group).
    - Remaining elements are 0 (Filler/Gap).
Output:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers.
  Length: Same as input.
  Content: Same Pivot, Group, and Filler elements as input, rearranged.
Objects:
  - Pivot:
    Value: 2
    Occurrence: Exactly one.
    Role: Static reference point. Its position remains unchanged from input to output.
  - Group:
    Value: X (any digit != 0 and != 2)
    Occurrence: One contiguous block of one or more identical digits X.
    Role: Mobile element. Its position relative to the Pivot changes.
    Properties:
      - value (X)
      - start_index (input)
      - end_index (input)
      - length
  - Gap:
    Value: 0
    Occurrence: Variable number, located between Pivot and Group.
    Role: Defines spacing.
    Property: size (number of zeros strictly between Pivot and Group).
Relationships:
  - Relative Position (Input): The Group block is either entirely before or entirely after the Pivot index in the input.
  - Gap Size (Input): The number of zeros located strictly between the Pivot index and the nearest boundary index of the Group block.
Actions:
  1. Initialize Output: Create a sequence of the same length as the input, filled with zeros.
  2. Locate Pivot: Find the index of the Pivot element (2) in the Input.
  3. Place Pivot: Copy the Pivot element (2) to the same index in the Output.
  4. Locate Group: Find the value (X), start index, end index, and length of the Group block in the Input.
  5. Determine Input Configuration:
     - Identify if the Group was before or after the Pivot in the Input.
     - Calculate the Gap Size (number of zeros) between the Pivot and the Group in the Input.
  6. Calculate Output Position (Group):
     - If Group was *before* Pivot in Input: Calculate the start index for the Group in the Output such that it appears *after* the Pivot, separated by the calculated Gap Size. (Output start = Pivot index + 1 + Gap Size)
     - If Group was *after* Pivot in Input: Calculate the start index for the Group in the Output such that it appears *before* the Pivot, separated by the calculated Gap Size. (Output start = Pivot index - Gap Size - Group length)
  7. Place Group: Copy the Group block (all X digits) into the Output sequence at the calculated output start index.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input sequence of single-digit integers.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length, initially filled with zeros.
3.  Find the index (position) of the pivot element `2` in the input sequence.
4.  Place the pivot element `2` into the output sequence at this same index.
5.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits that are not `2` (the group block). Record its digit value (`X`), its start and end indices, and its length in the input sequence.
6.  Determine if the group block is positioned entirely before or entirely after the pivot index in the input sequence.
7.  Calculate the gap size, which is the count of zero elements located strictly between the pivot index and the nearest boundary (start or end index) of the group block in the input sequence.
8.  Determine the target position for the group block in the output sequence:
    *   If the group block was *before* the pivot in the input, its target position in the output is *after* the pivot, maintaining the calculated gap size between the pivot and the start of the group block. The group block will start at index `pivot_index + 1 + gap_size`.
    *   If the group block was *after* the pivot in the input, its target position in the output is *before* the pivot, maintaining the calculated gap size between the end of the group block and the pivot. The group block will start at index `pivot_index - gap_size - group_length`.
9.  Place the entire group block (all `X` digits) into the output sequence starting at the calculated target start index.
10. Return the constructed output sequence.
