Task: Rearrange a sequence by swapping a group block around a pivot, preserving the gap.
Input:
  Type: 1D sequence (List or NumPy array) of single-digit integers.
  Constraints:
    - Contains exactly one instance of the integer 2 (Pivot).
    - Contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (X), where X is not 2 (Group).
    - Remaining elements are 0 (Filler/Gap).
Output:
  Type: 1D sequence of integers.
  Length: Same as input.
  Content: Same Pivot, Group, and Filler elements as input, rearranged.
Objects:
  - Pivot:
    Value: 2
    Occurrence: Exactly one.
    Role: Static reference point. Its position remains unchanged from input to output.
  - Group:
    Value: X (any digit != 0 and != 2)
    Occurrence: One contiguous block of one or more identical digits X.
    Role: Mobile element. Its position relative to the Pivot changes.
    Properties:
      - value (X)
      - start_index (input)
      - end_index (input)
      - length
  - Gap:
    Value: 0
    Occurrence: Variable number, located between Pivot and Group.
    Role: Defines spacing.
    Property: size (number of zeros strictly between Pivot and Group).
Relationships:
  - Relative Position (Input): The Group block is either entirely before or entirely after the Pivot index in the input.
  - Gap Size (Input): The number of zeros located strictly between the Pivot index and the nearest boundary index of the Group block.
Actions:
  1. Initialize Output: Create a sequence of the same length as the input, filled with zeros.
  2. Locate Pivot: Find the index of the Pivot element (2) in the Input.
  3. Place Pivot: Copy the Pivot element (2) to the same index in the Output.
  4. Locate Group: Find the value (X), start index, end index, and length of the Group block in the Input.
  5. Determine Input Configuration:
     - Identify if the Group was before or after the Pivot in the Input.
     - Calculate the Gap Size (number of zeros) between the Pivot and the Group in the Input.
  6. Calculate Output Position (Group):
     - If Group was *before* Pivot in Input: Calculate the start index for the Group in the Output such that it appears *after* the Pivot, separated by the calculated Gap Size. (Output start = Pivot index + 1 + Gap Size)
     - If Group was *after* Pivot in Input: Calculate the start index for the Group in the Output such that it appears *before* the Pivot, separated by the calculated Gap Size. (Output start = Pivot index - Gap Size - Group length)
  7. Place Group: Copy the Group block (all X digits) into the Output sequence at the calculated output start index.
