Task: Rearrange elements in a sequence around a pivot.
Input:
  Type: List of integers (single digits).
  Length: Variable (consistent between input/output pairs).
  Contains:
    - Zeros: Multiple instances.
    - Pivot: Exactly one instance of the integer 2.
    - Group: One contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (X), where X is not 2.
Output:
  Type: List of integers (single digits).
  Length: Same as input.
  Contains:
    - Zeros: Multiple instances.
    - Pivot: Exactly one instance of the integer 2.
    - Group: The same contiguous block of integer X as in the input.
Objects:
  - Pivot Element: The integer 2.
    Properties: Unique in the sequence.
    Role: Acts as a fixed reference point positionally.
  - Group Element: A contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (X != 2).
    Properties: Consists of one or more instances of X; contiguous.
    Role: Moves relative to the Pivot Element.
  - Zero Element: The integer 0.
    Role: Fills the remaining space.
Relationships:
  - Pivot Position: The index of the Pivot Element (2) remains unchanged from input to output.
  - Group Position: The position of the Group Element (block of X) changes relative to the Pivot Element.
Actions:
  1. Identify the index of the Pivot Element (2).
  2. Identify the block of Group Element (X) and its starting/ending indices.
  3. Determine if the Group Element block is positioned before or after the Pivot Element in the input sequence.
  4. Construct the output sequence (initially all zeros).
  5. Place the Pivot Element (2) in the output sequence at its original index.
  6. Place the Group Element block (X) in the output sequence:
     - If the Group was *before* the Pivot in the input, place it immediately *after* the Pivot in the output.
     - If the Group was *after* the Pivot in the input, place it immediately *before* the Pivot in the output.
  7. Ensure all other positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
