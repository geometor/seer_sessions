Each input sequence contains:\n1.  Multiple zeros (`0`).\n2.  Exactly one instance of the digit `2`.\n3.  One contiguous block (group) of one or more identical non-zero digits, which are different from `2`. Let's call this digit `X`.\n\nThe output is also a sequence of single-digit integers of the same length as the input. The transformation involves rearranging the positions of the digit `2` and the block of digits `X` relative to each other, while the rest of the sequence is filled with zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Identify the index of the Pivot Element (2).\n  2. Identify the block of Group Element (X) and its starting/ending indices.\n  3. Determine if the Group Element block is positioned before or after the Pivot Element in the input sequence.\n  4. Construct the output sequence (initially all zeros).\n  5. Place the Pivot Element (2) in the output sequence at its original index.\n  6. Place the Group Element block (X) in the output sequence:\n     - If the Group was *before* the Pivot in the input, place it immediately *after* the Pivot in the output.\n     - If the Group was *after* the Pivot in the input, place it immediately *before* the Pivot in the output.\n  7.
