Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

The task operates on sequences (lists) of single-digit integers. Each input sequence contains:
1.  Multiple zeros (`0`).
2.  Exactly one instance of the digit `2`.
3.  One contiguous block (group) of one or more identical non-zero digits, which are different from `2`. Let's call this digit `X`.

The output is also a sequence of single-digit integers of the same length as the input. The transformation involves rearranging the positions of the digit `2` and the block of digits `X` relative to each other, while the rest of the sequence is filled with zeros.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Rearrange elements in a sequence around a pivot.
Input:
  Type: List of integers (single digits).
  Length: Variable (consistent between input/output pairs).
  Contains:
    - Zeros: Multiple instances.
    - Pivot: Exactly one instance of the integer 2.
    - Group: One contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (X), where X is not 2.
Output:
  Type: List of integers (single digits).
  Length: Same as input.
  Contains:
    - Zeros: Multiple instances.
    - Pivot: Exactly one instance of the integer 2.
    - Group: The same contiguous block of integer X as in the input.
Objects:
  - Pivot Element: The integer 2.
    Properties: Unique in the sequence.
    Role: Acts as a fixed reference point positionally.
  - Group Element: A contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (X != 2).
    Properties: Consists of one or more instances of X; contiguous.
    Role: Moves relative to the Pivot Element.
  - Zero Element: The integer 0.
    Role: Fills the remaining space.
Relationships:
  - Pivot Position: The index of the Pivot Element (2) remains unchanged from input to output.
  - Group Position: The position of the Group Element (block of X) changes relative to the Pivot Element.
Actions:
  1. Identify the index of the Pivot Element (2).
  2. Identify the block of Group Element (X) and its starting/ending indices.
  3. Determine if the Group Element block is positioned before or after the Pivot Element in the input sequence.
  4. Construct the output sequence (initially all zeros).
  5. Place the Pivot Element (2) in the output sequence at its original index.
  6. Place the Group Element block (X) in the output sequence:
     - If the Group was *before* the Pivot in the input, place it immediately *after* the Pivot in the output.
     - If the Group was *after* the Pivot in the input, place it immediately *before* the Pivot in the output.
  7. Ensure all other positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input list of integers.
2.  Create an output list of the same length, initialized with zeros.
3.  Find the index (position) of the digit `2` in the input list.
4.  Place the digit `2` into the output list at this same index.
5.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits that are not `2`. Record the digit value (`X`) and the starting and ending indices of this block in the input list.
6.  Compare the starting index of the block `X` with the index of `2`.
7.  If the block `X` started *before* the index of `2`:
    *   Place the entire block `X` into the output list immediately *after* the position of `2`.
8.  If the block `X` started *after* the index of `2`:
    *   Place the entire block `X` into the output list immediately *before* the position of `2`, ensuring the block ends just before the index of `2`.
9.  Return the constructed output list.
```python
"""
Transforms an input list of single-digit integers based on the relative positions of a 'pivot' element (2) and a contiguous 'group' of identical non-zero elements (X, where X != 2).

The transformation rule is:
1. Find the index of the pivot element (2).
2. Find the contiguous block of the group element (X) and its properties (value, start index, length).
3. Keep the pivot element (2) at its original index in the output list.
4. If the group element block was positioned *before* the pivot in the input, move it to be positioned immediately *after* the pivot in the output.
5. If the group element block was positioned *after* the pivot in the input, move it to be positioned immediately *before* the pivot in the output.
6. Fill all other positions in the output list with zeros.
