Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single lists (or sequences) of integers.
2.  **Key Values:** The integers `0` and `2` appear frequently. Other non-zero integers (`3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`) also appear.
3.  **Role of Zero:** Zeros seem to act as background or empty space.
4.  **Role of Two:** The number `2` appears exactly once in every input and output, and its index (position) remains the same from input to output. It seems to function as a fixed pivot or boundary marker.
5.  **Other Non-Zero Numbers (Payload):** Other non-zero numbers often appear in contiguous blocks of identical values (e.g., `5 5`, `4 4 4 4`, `8 8 8 8`). These blocks (or single non-zero numbers) seem to be the elements that are moved. Let's call these the "payload".
6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the payload relative to the fixed position of the pivot `2`. The destination of the payload depends on whether it was originally located before or after the pivot `2`.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Move a block of numbers relative to a fixed pivot '2'.

Input:
  Type: List[int]
  Properties:
    - Contains zeros.
    - Contains exactly one '2' (the pivot).
    - Contains at least one other non-zero number (the payload).
    - Payloads can be single numbers or contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers.

Output:
  Type: List[int]
  Properties:
    - Same length as the input list.
    - Contains the same pivot '2' at the same index as in the input.
    - Contains the same payload numbers as in the input, but potentially at a different location.
    - Contains zeros filling the remaining positions.

Transformation:
  Action: Relocate the 'payload' block.
  Pivot: The number '2'. Its position remains fixed.
  Payload: The contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers other than '2'.
  Rule:
    Condition: Payload is originally located *before* the pivot '2'.
      Result: Payload is moved to the portion of the list *after* the pivot '2'. Its specific position preserves the number of zeros originally between the payload and the pivot.
    Condition: Payload is originally located *after* the pivot '2'.
      Result: Payload is moved to the beginning of the list (index 0).
  Relationships:
    - The position of '2' dictates the separation point for analyzing payload location.
    - The relative order (before/after '2') determines the destination region (after '2' / before '2').
    - Zeros act as spacers, and the number of zeros between payload and pivot (when payload is before pivot) influences the final placement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Locate the index of the pivot element `2` in the input list.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers that are not `2`; this is the payload. Note its value, starting index, and ending index.
3.  Create a new list of the same length as the input, filled entirely with zeros.
4.  Place the pivot element `2` into the new list at its original index.
5.  Compare the starting index of the payload with the index of the pivot `2`.
6.  If the payload's starting index is less than the pivot's index (payload was before the pivot):
    a.  Count the number of zeros in the input list strictly between the end of the payload block and the pivot `2`.
    b.  Calculate the target starting index in the new list for the payload: `pivot_index + 1 + count_of_intermediate_zeros`.
    c.  Place the payload block into the new list starting at this target index.
7.  If the payload's starting index is greater than the pivot's index (payload was after the pivot):
    a.  Place the payload block into the new list starting at index 0.
8.  Return the newly constructed list.
