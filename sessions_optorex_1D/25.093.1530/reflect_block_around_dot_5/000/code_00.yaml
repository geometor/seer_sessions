Task: Move a block of numbers relative to a fixed pivot '2'.

Input:
  Type: List[int]
  Properties:
    - Contains zeros.
    - Contains exactly one '2' (the pivot).
    - Contains at least one other non-zero number (the payload).
    - Payloads can be single numbers or contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers.

Output:
  Type: List[int]
  Properties:
    - Same length as the input list.
    - Contains the same pivot '2' at the same index as in the input.
    - Contains the same payload numbers as in the input, but potentially at a different location.
    - Contains zeros filling the remaining positions.

Transformation:
  Action: Relocate the 'payload' block.
  Pivot: The number '2'. Its position remains fixed.
  Payload: The contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers other than '2'.
  Rule:
    Condition: Payload is originally located *before* the pivot '2'.
      Result: Payload is moved to the portion of the list *after* the pivot '2'. Its specific position preserves the number of zeros originally between the payload and the pivot.
    Condition: Payload is originally located *after* the pivot '2'.
      Result: Payload is moved to the beginning of the list (index 0).
  Relationships:
    - The position of '2' dictates the separation point for analyzing payload location.
    - The relative order (before/after '2') determines the destination region (after '2' / before '2').
    - Zeros act as spacers, and the number of zeros between payload and pivot (when payload is before pivot) influences the final placement.
