Other non-zero integers (`3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`) also appear.\n3.  **Role of Zero:** Zeros seem to act as background or empty space.\n4.  **Role of Two:** The number `2` appears exactly once in every input and output, and its index (position) remains the same from input to output. It seems to function as a fixed pivot or boundary marker.\n5.  **Other Non-Zero Numbers (Payload):** Other non-zero numbers often appear in contiguous blocks of identical values (e.g., `5 5`, `4 4 4 4`, `8 8 8 8`). These blocks (or single non-zero numbers) seem to be the elements that are moved. Let's call these the \"payload\".\n6.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves moving the payload relative to the fixed position of the pivot `2`. The destination of the payload depends on whether it was originally located before or after the pivot `2`.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Its position remains fixed.\n  Payload: The contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers other than '2'.\n  Rule:\n    Condition: Payload is originally located *before* the pivot '2'.\n      Result: Payload is moved to the portion of the list *after* the pivot '2'. Its specific position preserves the number of zeros originally between the payload and the pivot.\n    Condition: Payload is originally located *after* the pivot '2'.\n      Result: Payload is moved to the beginning of the list (index 0).\n  Relationships:\n    - The position of '2' dictates the separation point for analyzing payload location.\n    - The relative order (before/after '2') determines the destination region (after '2' / before '2').\n    - Zeros act as spacers, and the number of zeros between payload and pivot (when payload is before pivot) influences the final placement.\n```"
