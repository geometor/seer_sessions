"""
Transforms an input list of integers based on the following rules:
1.  Identifies a fixed 'pivot' element, which is the number 2. The pivot's position remains unchanged.
2.  Identifies a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers other than 2, referred to as the 'payload'.
3.  Creates an output list of the same size, initially filled with zeros.
4.  Places the pivot '2' in the output list at its original index.
5.  Determines the new location for the 'payload' based on its original position relative to the pivot:
    a.  If the payload was originally *before* the pivot, it is moved to the section *after* the pivot. The number of zeros originally between the payload and the pivot is preserved as spacing after the pivot before the payload starts in the output.
    b.  If the payload was originally *after* the pivot, it is moved to the beginning of the output list (index 0).
6.  Fills the remaining positions in the output list with zeros.
