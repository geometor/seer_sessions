Task: Relocate a block of numbers relative to a fixed pivot '2'.

Input:
  Type: Sequence[int] (List or 1D NumPy array)
  Objects:
    - Background:
        Value: 0
        Purpose: Fills space.
    - Pivot:
        Value: 2
        Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence.
        Property: Position remains fixed in the output.
    - Payload:
        Property: The first contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers, excluding the pivot '2'.
        Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence (based on examples).
        Attributes:
          - value (int > 0, != 2)
          - start_index (int >= 0)
          - end_index (int >= start_index)
          - length (int > 0)

Output:
  Type: Sequence[int] (Matching input type and length)
  Properties:
    - Contains the same Pivot element at the same index as the input.
    - Contains the same Payload block (value and length) as the input, but potentially relocated.
    - Contains Background zeros filling all other positions.

Transformation:
  Action: Move the Payload block based on its position relative to the Pivot.
  Rule:
    Condition: Payload block starts *before* the Pivot index.
      Action:
        1. Identify the number of Background zeros strictly between the end of the Payload block and the Pivot in the input.
        2. Calculate the target start index for the Payload block in the output: `pivot_index + 1 + count_of_intermediate_zeros`.
        3. Place the Payload block starting at the target index in the output.
        4. Fill remaining positions (excluding the fixed Pivot) with Background zeros.
    Condition: Payload block starts *after* the Pivot index.
      Action:
        1. Place the Payload block starting at index 0 in the output.
        2. Fill remaining positions (excluding the fixed Pivot) with Background zeros.
