## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided execution results show a consistent failure across all training examples. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was called with a NumPy array as input, while it was designed to accept a space-separated string.

The core transformation logic (reflection around the pivot '2') developed in the previous phase appears conceptually correct based on the manual analysis of the examples. The failure is due to an incorrect assumption about the input data type provided by the execution environment.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or potentially a standard Python list) directly as input, bypassing the string parsing (`_parse_input`) step.
2.  **Adapt Output Handling:** Similarly, the function should return a list or NumPy array, removing the string formatting (`_format_output`) step, assuming the environment handles the final conversion to the required output format.
3.  **Validate Core Logic:** Ensure the reflection logic operates correctly on the list/array data structure.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the input/output types as sequences of integers (lists or arrays) rather than strings.

## Metrics Gathering

The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred because the `transform` function's first step, `_parse_input(input_str)`, expects `input_str` to be a string and calls `.split()` on it. However, the test harness supplied a NumPy array instead.

*   **Input Type Discrepancy:** The function expected `str`, but received `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Failure Point:** The `.split()` method call within `_parse_input` (or directly in `transform` if `_parse_input` was inlined/removed).
*   **Success Rate:** 0% across all provided examples due to the type mismatch.
*   **Core Logic Status:** Untested due to the input handling error, but the initial analysis suggests the reflection logic itself is likely correct.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input sequence (assumed to be a list or array of integers). Determine its length (`N`).
2.  Find the index (position) of the pivot element `2` within the input sequence. Let this be `pivot_index`. If the pivot `2` is not found, return the original input sequence unchanged (or handle as an error based on specific requirements).
3.  Create a new output sequence of length `N`, initially filled entirely with placeholder elements `0`.
4.  Place the pivot element `2` into the output sequence at the `pivot_index`.
5.  Iterate through each element and its index (`i`) in the *input* sequence.
6.  If the current element is not the pivot (`2`) and is not a placeholder (`0`):
    a.  Calculate the element's reflected index: `reflected_index = 2 * pivot_index - i`.
    b.  Check if the `reflected_index` is within the valid bounds of the sequence (i.e., `0 <= reflected_index < N`).
    c.  If the `reflected_index` is within bounds, place the current element's value into the output sequence at the `reflected_index`. (Elements reflecting outside the bounds are discarded).
7.  Return the completed output sequence.
