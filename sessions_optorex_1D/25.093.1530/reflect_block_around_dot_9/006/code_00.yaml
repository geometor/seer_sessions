task: Reflect non-zero elements (excluding pivot 2) across the pivot's position within a sequence of integers.
input_format: A sequence (List or NumPy array) of integers. # Updated
output_format: A sequence (List or NumPy array) of integers. # Updated
constraints:
  - Sequence length is fixed per example (12 in training examples).
  - The digit '2' appears exactly once and acts as the pivot.
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int] | numpy.ndarray # Updated
    description: Represents the input and output data structure.
  - name: pivot_element
    type: int
    value: 2
    description: The element around which the reflection occurs. Remains fixed in position.
  - name: movable_element
    type: int
    description: Any non-zero integer other than the pivot (2). These elements change position.
  - name: placeholder_element
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: Represents empty space in the sequence. Fills positions not occupied by the pivot or reflected movable elements.
properties:
  - name: position
    type: int
    description: The index of an element within the sequence (0-based).
  - name: pivot_position
    type: int
    description: The index of the pivot element (2) in the input sequence.
  - name: distance_from_pivot
    type: int
    description: The difference between an element's index and the pivot_position (`i - pivot_index`).
relationships:
  - type: reflection
    description: Each movable element's position in the output is a reflection of its input position across the pivot position.
    element1: movable_element (input position `i`)
    element2: pivot_element (position `p`)
    element3: movable_element (output position `p - (i - p)` or `2*p - i`)
  - type: invariance
    description: The pivot element (2) maintains its original position in the output sequence.
    element: pivot_element
  - type: preservation
    description: The values of movable elements are preserved during the transformation.
actions:
  - name: find_pivot
    input: sequence
    output: pivot_index
    description: Locate the index of the pivot element (2) in the input sequence.
  - name: identify_movable
    input: sequence
    output: list_of_movable_elements_with_indices
    description: Find all non-zero elements and their indices, excluding the pivot.
  - name: calculate_reflection_index
    input: element_index, pivot_index
    output: reflected_index
    description: Determine the new index for a movable element by reflecting its original index across the pivot_index using the formula `reflected_index = 2 * pivot_index - element_index`.
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    input: input_sequence_length, pivot_index, movable_elements_and_indices
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a new sequence initialized with placeholders (0), place the pivot element at its original `pivot_index`, and place each movable element at its calculated `reflected_index` if it's within the sequence bounds.
