task: Reflect non-zero elements (excluding pivot 2) across the pivot's position within a sequence of integers.
input_format: A list or array of integers (e.g., numpy.ndarray or List[int]).
output_format: A list or array of integers (e.g., List[int] or numpy.ndarray).
constraints:
  - Sequence length is fixed (12 in examples).
  - The integer '2' appears exactly once and acts as the pivot.
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int] # Updated type
    description: Represents the input and output data structure.
  - name: pivot_element
    type: int
    value: 2
    description: The element around which the reflection occurs. Remains fixed in position.
  - name: movable_element
    type: int
    description: Any non-zero integer other than the pivot (2). These elements change position.
  - name: placeholder_element
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: Represents empty space in the sequence. Fills positions not occupied by the pivot or reflected movable elements.
properties:
  - name: position
    type: int
    description: The index of an element within the sequence (0-based).
  - name: pivot_position
    type: int
    description: The index of the pivot element (2) in the input sequence.
  - name: distance_from_pivot
    type: int
    description: The signed difference between an element's position and the pivot_position (`element_position - pivot_position`).
actions:
  - name: find_pivot
    input: sequence
    output: pivot_position
    description: Locate the index of the pivot element (2) in the input sequence.
  - name: identify_movable
    description: Find all non-zero elements and their positions, excluding the pivot, within the input sequence.
  - name: calculate_reflection
    input: element_position, pivot_position
    output: reflected_position
    description: Determine the new position for a movable element by reflecting its original position across the pivot_position. `reflected_position = pivot_position - (element_position - pivot_position) = 2 * pivot_position - element_position`.
  - name: construct_output
    input: input_sequence, pivot_position
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a new sequence initialized with placeholders (0), place the pivot element at its original position, and place each movable element from the input sequence at its calculated reflected position in the new sequence.
relationships:
  - type: reflection
    description: Each movable element's position in the output sequence is a reflection of its input position across the pivot position.
    element1: movable_element (input position `i`)
    element2: pivot_element (position `p`)
    element3: movable_element (output position `p - (i - p)`)
  - type: invariance
    description: The pivot element (2) maintains its original position in the output sequence.
    element: pivot_element
  - type: preservation
    description: The values of movable elements are preserved during the transformation, only their positions change.
