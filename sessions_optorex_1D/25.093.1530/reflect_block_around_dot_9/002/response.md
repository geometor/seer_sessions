**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because it assumed the input/output format was a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided/expected NumPy arrays or equivalent list-like structures. The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch during input parsing. The core reflection logic identified in the "dream" phase seems correct based on manual checks against the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing (`_parse_input`).
2.  Modify the `transform` function to return a list or NumPy array of integers, removing the string formatting (`_format_output`).
3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts, Natural Language Program) to reflect that the transformation operates on lists/arrays of integers.

**Metrics and Observations**

*   **Input Type:** The execution environment provides input as a `numpy.ndarray`.
*   **Output Type:** It is highly probable that the execution environment expects the output in the same format, i.e., `numpy.ndarray` or a standard Python `List[int]`. Returning a list is generally safer and compatible.
*   **Core Logic Validity:** Manually tracing the reflection logic with list inputs for examples 1 and 2 confirms the algorithm correctly determines the output sequence of numbers.
    *   Example 1 Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Pivot index 4. Reflects 3s at indices 0,1,2,3 to indices 8,7,6,5. Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected sequence.
    *   Example 2 Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]` -> Pivot index 6. Reflects 3s at indices 8,9 to indices 4,3. Output: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected sequence.
*   **Error Source:** The errors were solely due to the incorrect handling of input/output types (string vs. array/list), not a flaw in the transformation algorithm itself.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml

    output: reflected_position
    description: Determine the new position for a movable element by reflecting its original position across the pivot_position. `reflected_position = pivot_position - (element_position - pivot_position) = 2 * pivot_position - element_position`.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence (a list or array of integers). Determine its length.
2.  Find the index (position) of the pivot element `2` within the input sequence. Let this be `pivot_index`.
3.  Create a new output sequence (list) of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled entirely with placeholder elements `0`.
4.  Place the pivot element `2` into the output sequence at the `pivot_index`.
5.  Iterate through each element and its index (`i`) in the *input* sequence.
6.  If the current element is not the pivot (`2`) and is not a placeholder (`0`):
    a.  Calculate the element's reflected index: `reflected_index = pivot_index - (i - pivot_index)` which simplifies to `2 * pivot_index - i`.
    b.  Check if the `reflected_index` is within the valid bounds of the sequence (0 to length-1).
    c.  If it is within bounds, place the current element's value into the output sequence at the calculated `reflected_index`.
7.  Return the completed output sequence (as a list or array).
