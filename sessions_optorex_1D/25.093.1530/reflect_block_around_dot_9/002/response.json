            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed because it assumed the input/output format was a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided/expected NumPy arrays or equivalent list-like structures. The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch during input parsing. The core reflection logic identified in the \"dream\" phase seems correct based on manual checks against the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array of integers directly, removing the string parsing (`_parse_input`).\n2.  Modify the `transform` function to return a list or NumPy array of integers, removing the string formatting (`_format_output`).\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts, Natural Language Program) to reflect that the transformation operates on lists/arrays of integers.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n*   **Input Type:** The execution environment provides input as a `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Output Type:** It is highly probable that the execution environment expects the output in the same format, i.e., `numpy.ndarray` or a standard Python `List[int]`. Returning a list is generally safer and compatible.\n*   **Core Logic Validity:** Manually tracing the reflection logic with list inputs for examples 1 and 2 confirms the algorithm correctly determines the output sequence of numbers.\n    *   Example 1 Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` -> Pivot index 4. Reflects 3s at indices 0,1,2,3 to indices 8,7,6,5. Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected sequence.\n    *   Example 2 Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]` -> Pivot index 6. Reflects 3s at indices 8,9 to indices 4,3. Output: `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches expected sequence.\n*   **Error Source:** The errors were solely due to the incorrect handling of input/output types (string vs. array/list), not a flaw in the transformation algorithm itself.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
