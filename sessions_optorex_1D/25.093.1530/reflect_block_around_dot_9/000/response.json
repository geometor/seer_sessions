All examples have a sequence length of 12.\n2.  **Key Numbers:**\n    *   `0`: Appears frequently and seems to act as a background or empty space.\n    *   `2`: Appears exactly once in each input and output. Its position seems crucial.\n    *   Other non-zero digits (`1`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `9` in the examples): These appear in contiguous groups or as single elements and are rearranged in the output.\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation involves rearranging the non-zero digits (excluding `2`) relative to the position of `2`. The digit `2` itself remains in the same position in the sequence. The arrangement of other non-zero digits appears mirrored or reflected across the position of `2`. Zeros fill the remaining positions.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
