"""
Transforms an input sequence by swapping the relative position of a target block 
(a contiguous sequence of identical non-zero numbers, not equal to 2) with 
respect to a fixed pivot element '2'. The transformation preserves the number 
of zeros (gap) between the target block and the pivot. The pivot element '2' 
maintains its original absolute position in the sequence. The input and output 
are lists of integers.
