This block is distinct from the pivot `2`.\n3.  **Implicit Structure:** The sequence represents positions in a line. The core components are the pivot `2` and the target block. Zeros act as spacers or filler.\n4.  **Transformation Goal:** The fundamental change involves altering the relative positions of the target block and the pivot `2`.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
