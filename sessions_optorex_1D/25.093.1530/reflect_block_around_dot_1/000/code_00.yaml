task_description: Swap the relative position of a target block of identical non-zero numbers with respect to a fixed pivot element '2', preserving the gap between them.

elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
  - object: pivot
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - count: 1 per sequence
      - role: fixed reference point
  - object: target_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous subsequence
      - content: identical non-zero integers (not equal to 2)
      - length: variable (>= 1)
      - count: 1 per sequence
      - role: element to be repositioned
  - object: zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: filler/spacer

relationships:
  - type: position
    between: [target_block, pivot]
    states: [target_block_left_of_pivot, target_block_right_of_pivot]
  - type: separation
    between: [target_block, pivot]
    properties:
      - name: gap
      - value: number of zeros between the block and the pivot
      - conserved: yes (the gap size is preserved during transformation)

actions:
  - action: identify
    target: pivot (2)
    details: Find its value and index.
  - action: identify
    target: target_block
    details: Find its value, start index, end index, and length.
  - action: determine_relative_position
    elements: [target_block, pivot]
    output: left or right
  - action: calculate_gap
    elements: [target_block, pivot]
    output: number of zeros between them
  - action: construct_output_sequence
    details: Create a new sequence of 12 zeros.
  - action: place_pivot
    target: output_sequence
    details: Place the pivot '2' at its original index.
  - action: place_target_block
    target: output_sequence
    details: |
      Place the target block on the opposite side of the pivot '2'
      compared to its input position, ensuring the calculated gap
      (number of zeros) between the pivot and the block is maintained.
