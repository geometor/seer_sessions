**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary issue identified is an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, parse it into a list, perform the transformation, and return a space-separated string. However, the testing environment seems to be passing a NumPy array (or potentially a list) directly to the function.

The core logic described in the previous Natural Language Program and implemented conceptually in the Python code appears sound, as manually walking through the examples confirmed its validity. The error is purely an interface mismatch, not a logical flaw in the transformation rule itself.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** The `transform` function's signature and initial parsing step need to be adjusted in the Coder phase to accept a list or NumPy array directly, eliminating the `.split()` call on the input.
2.  **Verify Logic:** Although manual checks suggest the logic is correct, we will use code execution to systematically extract key metrics from each example to rigorously confirm the pattern holds for all cases.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on the verified metrics, ensuring clarity and precision. The core transformation rule remains the same: swap the relative position of the target block and the pivot `2`, keeping `2` fixed and preserving the zero-gap between them.
