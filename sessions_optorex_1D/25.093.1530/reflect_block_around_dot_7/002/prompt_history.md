Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings. They appear to have a fixed length (12 elements in all examples).
*   **Key Elements:** The sequences contain zeros and non-zero digits. The digit `2` seems to play a special role, appearing in every example. Other non-zero digits vary.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation rearranges the non-zero digits while keeping the zeros as background/fillers. The total count of each non-zero digit is preserved between input and output. The position of the digit `2` remains unchanged from input to output. The positions of the *other* non-zero digits are altered relative to the position of the `2`. Specifically, their positions appear to be mirrored across the position of the `2`.

**YAML Facts:**

elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      format: space-separated integers
      length: 12 (constant in examples)

        - non_zero_integers
  - type: integer_0
    description: Acts as a placeholder or background filler.
  - type: non_zero_integers
    description: The elements that are actively rearranged.
    contains:
      - pivot_element
      - other_non_zero_elements
  - type: pivot_element
    properties:
      value: 2
      role: Its position remains fixed and acts as the center point for rearrangement.
  - type: other_non_zero_elements
    description: All non-zero integers other than '2'.
    properties:
      value: any digit 1, 3-9
      position: Their original position relative to the pivot determines their final position.

        if original_position < position_of_2:
          new_position = position_of_2 + distance
        else:

        place value at new_position in output_sequence
  - name: format_output
    input: final_output_sequence
    output: space-separated string representation

goal: Transform the input sequence into the output sequence by keeping '2' fixed and mirroring the positions of all other non-zero elements across the position of '2'.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Find the index (position) of the number `2`. Let this be the `pivot_index`.
3.  Create a list to store the value and original index of all other non-zero numbers found in the input sequence.
4.  Initialize a new output sequence of the same length as the input, filled entirely with zeros.
5.  Place the number `2` into the output sequence at the `pivot_index`.
6.  For each non-zero number (and its `original_index`) stored in step 3:
    a.  Calculate the distance between its `original_index` and the `pivot_index`.
    b.  If the number's `original_index` was less than the `pivot_index`, calculate its `new_index` as `pivot_index + distance`.
    c.  If the number's `original_index` was greater than the `pivot_index`, calculate its `new_index` as `pivot_index - distance`.
    d.  Place the number into the output sequence at its calculated `new_index`.
7.  The final output sequence is the result.

"""
Transforms an input sequence of numbers by fixing the position of the number '2' 
and mirroring the positions of all other non-zero numbers across the position of '2'.

1.  Find the index (position) of the number `2` (the pivot_index).
2.  Identify all other non-zero numbers and their original indices.
3.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length, filled with zeros.
4.  Place `2` into the output sequence at the pivot_index.
5.  For each identified non-zero number (other than '2'):
    a.  Calculate its distance from the pivot_index.
    b.  Determine its new index by mirroring its position relative to the pivot_index 
        (if original < pivot, new = pivot + distance; if original > pivot, new = pivot - distance).
    c.  Place the number into the output sequence at its calculated new index.
6.  Return the final output sequence formatted as a space-separated string.
