            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified across all examples is an input type mismatch. The initial analysis correctly deduced the transformation logic (mirroring non-zero elements around the fixed position of '2'), but incorrectly assumed the input format was a space-separated string. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the `transform` function receives a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is straightforward:\n1.  Modify the function signature and internal logic to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is functionally similar for this task) as input.\n2.  Remove the initial string parsing step (`_parse_input`).\n3.  Ensure the core transformation logic operates correctly on the array/list elements.\n4.  Retain the final step of formatting the resulting list/array into a space-separated string for the output.\n\nThe core mirroring logic identified previously appears sound and consistent with the input/output pairs; only the input handling needs adjustment.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** NumPy ndarray (1D) of integers. This is consistent across all failed examples.\n*   **Output Type:** Space-separated string of integers. (Assumed based on initial examples and typical task format).\n*   **Sequence Length:** 12 (Consistent across all examples).\n*   **Pivot Element:** Integer `2`. Present in all examples. Its position remains constant between input and output.\n*   **Other Elements:** Integers `0` (filler) and other non-zero digits (1, 3-9). The count and values of non-pivot, non-zero digits are preserved between input and output, but their positions change.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** Mirroring positions of non-pivot, non-zero elements across the index of the pivot element `2`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
