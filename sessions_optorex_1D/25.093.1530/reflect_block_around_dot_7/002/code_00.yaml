task_description: Rearrange non-zero elements in a fixed-length numerical sequence by mirroring their positions across the fixed position of the element '2'.

elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      format: 1D NumPy array of integers
      length: 12 (constant in examples)
      contains:
        - integer_0
        - non_zero_integers
  - type: integer_0
    description: Acts as a placeholder or background filler. Value is 0.
  - type: non_zero_integers
    description: The elements that are actively rearranged or act as a pivot.
    contains:
      - pivot_element
      - other_non_zero_elements
  - type: pivot_element
    properties:
      value: 2
      role: Its position remains fixed between input and output and acts as the center point for rearrangement.
  - type: other_non_zero_elements
    description: All non-zero integers other than '2'.
    properties:
      value: any digit 1, 3-9
      position: Their original position relative to the pivot determines their final position.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    between: other_non_zero_elements
    and: pivot_element
    values: [before, after] # Based on index comparison
  - type: distance
    between: other_non_zero_elements
    and: pivot_element
    calculation: absolute difference of indices

actions:
  - name: identify_pivot_index
    input: input_array
    output: index_of_2
    action: Find the index of the element with value 2 in the input array.
  - name: identify_others
    input: input_array
    output: list_of (value, original_index) for non-zeros != 2
    action: Iterate through the input array, storing the value and index of each element that is not 0 and not 2.
  - name: initialize_output
    input: sequence_length
    output: array_of_zeros
    action: Create a new array (or list) of the same length as the input, filled with zeros.
  - name: place_pivot
    input: output_array, index_of_2
    action: Place the value 2 at index_of_2 in the output array.
  - name: mirror_and_place_others
    input: output_array, list_of_others, index_of_2
    action:
      for each (value, original_index) in list_of_others:
        calculate distance = abs(original_index - index_of_2)
        if original_index < index_of_2:
          new_index = index_of_2 + distance
        else: # original_index > index_of_2
          new_index = index_of_2 - distance
        place value at new_index in output_array. Handle potential index out-of-bounds if necessary (though not expected based on mirroring logic and examples).
  - name: format_output
    input: final_output_array
    output: space-separated_string
    action: Convert the elements of the final array to strings and join them with spaces.

goal: Transform the input array into the output string by keeping '2' fixed and mirroring the positions of all other non-zero elements across the position of '2'.
