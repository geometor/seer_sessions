**General Assessment:**

The primary issue identified across all examples is an input type mismatch. The initial analysis correctly deduced the transformation logic (mirroring non-zero elements around the fixed position of '2'), but incorrectly assumed the input format was a space-separated string. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates the `transform` function receives a NumPy array.

The strategy for resolving this is straightforward:
1.  Modify the function signature and internal logic to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, which is functionally similar for this task) as input.
2.  Remove the initial string parsing step (`_parse_input`).
3.  Ensure the core transformation logic operates correctly on the array/list elements.
4.  Retain the final step of formatting the resulting list/array into a space-separated string for the output.

The core mirroring logic identified previously appears sound and consistent with the input/output pairs; only the input handling needs adjustment.

**Metrics:**

*   **Input Type:** NumPy ndarray (1D) of integers. This is consistent across all failed examples.
*   **Output Type:** Space-separated string of integers. (Assumed based on initial examples and typical task format).
*   **Sequence Length:** 12 (Consistent across all examples).
*   **Pivot Element:** Integer `2`. Present in all examples. Its position remains constant between input and output.
*   **Other Elements:** Integers `0` (filler) and other non-zero digits (1, 3-9). The count and values of non-pivot, non-zero digits are preserved between input and output, but their positions change.
*   **Transformation Rule:** Mirroring positions of non-pivot, non-zero elements across the index of the pivot element `2`.

task_description: Rearrange non-zero elements in a fixed-length numerical sequence by mirroring their positions across the fixed position of the element '2'.

elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      format: 1D NumPy array of integers
      length: 12 (constant in examples)
      contains:
        - integer_0
        - non_zero_integers
  - type: integer_0
    description: Acts as a placeholder or background filler. Value is 0.
  - type: non_zero_integers
    description: The elements that are actively rearranged or act as a pivot.
    contains:
      - pivot_element
      - other_non_zero_elements
  - type: pivot_element
    properties:
      value: 2
      role: Its position remains fixed between input and output and acts as the center point for rearrangement.
  - type: other_non_zero_elements
    description: All non-zero integers other than '2'.
    properties:
      value: any digit 1, 3-9
      position: Their original position relative to the pivot determines their final position.

relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    between: other_non_zero_elements
    and: pivot_element
    values: [before, after] # Based on index comparison
  - type: distance
    between: other_non_zero_elements
    and: pivot_element
    calculation: absolute difference of indices

actions:
  - name: identify_pivot_index
    input: input_array
    output: index_of_2
    action: Find the index of the element with value 2 in the input array.
  - name: identify_others
    input: input_array
    output: list_of (value, original_index) for non-zeros != 2
    action: Iterate through the input array, storing the value and index of each element that is not 0 and not 2.
  - name: initialize_output
    input: sequence_length
    output: array_of_zeros
    action: Create a new array (or list) of the same length as the input, filled with zeros.
  - name: place_pivot
    input: output_array, index_of_2
    action: Place the value 2 at index_of_2 in the output array.
  - name: mirror_and_place_others
    input: output_array, list_of_others, index_of_2
    action:
      for each (value, original_index) in list_of_others:
        calculate distance = abs(original_index - index_of_2)
        if original_index < index_of_2:
          new_index = index_of_2 + distance
        else: # original_index > index_of_2
          new_index = index_of_2 - distance
        place value at new_index in output_array. Handle potential index out-of-bounds if necessary (though not expected based on mirroring logic and examples).
  - name: format_output
    input: final_output_array
    output: space-separated_string
    action: Convert the elements of the final array to strings and join them with spaces.

goal: Transform the input array into the output string by keeping '2' fixed and mirroring the positions of all other non-zero elements across the position of '2'.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence as a list or array of integers.
2.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
3.  Find the index (position) of the number `2` within the input sequence. Let this be the `pivot_index`.
4.  Create a list to store the value and original index of all numbers in the input sequence that are not `0` and not `2`.
5.  Initialize a new output sequence (list or array) of the same length as the input, filled entirely with zeros.
6.  Place the number `2` into the output sequence at the `pivot_index`.
7.  For each number (and its `original_index`) stored in step 4:
    a.  Calculate the distance between its `original_index` and the `pivot_index` (`distance = abs(original_index - pivot_index)`).
    b.  If the number's `original_index` was less than the `pivot_index`, calculate its `new_index` as `pivot_index + distance`.
    c.  If the number's `original_index` was greater than the `pivot_index`, calculate its `new_index` as `pivot_index - distance`.
    d.  Place the number into the output sequence at its calculated `new_index`.
8.  Convert the elements of the completed output sequence into strings.
9.  Join these strings together with a single space between each element to create the final output string.
