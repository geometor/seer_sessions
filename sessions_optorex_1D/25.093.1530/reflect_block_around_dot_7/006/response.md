**General Assessment:**

The consistent error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all training and test examples clearly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array as input, not the space-separated string it was designed to parse using `input_str.split()`. The core logic of identifying the pivot ('2'), finding other non-zero elements, and calculating mirrored positions needs to be applied directly to this numerical array input. The final output still needs to be formatted as a space-separated string.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function signature to accept a numerical sequence (List[int] or np.ndarray) instead of a string.
2.  Remove the `_parse_input_string` function call as parsing is no longer needed.
3.  Ensure helper functions (`_find_pivot_index`, `_find_other_non_zeros`) correctly handle list or NumPy array inputs.
4.  Keep the `_format_output_list` function to convert the resulting list of integers into the required space-separated string format for the final output.
5.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to accurately reflect the input type and the adjusted process.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers (inferred from error messages).
*   **Output Type:** Space-separated string of integers (required format).
*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 in all provided training examples.
*   **Pivot Element:** The integer `2` is present in all inputs and its position remains fixed in the output.
*   **Other Elements:** Non-zero integers other than `2` change position. Their final position is determined by mirroring their original position relative to the pivot `2`. Zeroes act as placeholders.
*   **Error Cause:** The primary error is a type mismatch; the function expected a string input but received a NumPy array. The underlying transformation logic (mirroring around '2') has not yet been validated due to this initial error.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a numerical sequence (list or array of integers).
2.  Determine the length of the sequence.
3.  Find the index of the number `2` within the sequence. Let this be the `pivot_index`.
4.  Create a list to store the value and original index of all other elements in the sequence that are not zero and are not at the `pivot_index`.
5.  Initialize a new output list of the same length as the input, filled entirely with zeros.
6.  Place the number `2` into the output list at the `pivot_index`.
7.  For each non-zero element (and its `original_index`) stored in step 4:
    a.  Calculate its new mirrored index using the formula: `new_index = 2 * pivot_index - original_index`.
    b.  Check if the `new_index` is within the valid bounds (0 to length-1) of the output list.
    c.  If the `new_index` is valid, place the element's value into the output list at the `new_index`. (If multiple elements map to the same index, the last one processed will occupy that position).
8.  Convert the final output list into a space-separated string of numbers.
9.  Return the resulting string.
