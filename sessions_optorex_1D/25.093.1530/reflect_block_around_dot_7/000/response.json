They appear to have a fixed length (12 elements in all examples).\n*   **Key Elements:** The sequences contain zeros and non-zero digits. The digit `2` seems to play a special role, appearing in every example. Other non-zero digits vary.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation rearranges the non-zero digits while keeping the zeros as background/fillers. The total count of each non-zero digit is preserved between input and output. The position of the digit `2` remains unchanged from input to output. The positions of the *other* non-zero digits are altered relative to the position of the `2`. Specifically, their positions appear to be mirrored across the position of the `2`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
