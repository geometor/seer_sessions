task_description: Rearrange elements in a sequence represented by a space-separated string. The transformation involves mirroring the positions of non-zero elements (except for '2') across the fixed position of the element '2'.

input_format:
  type: string
  description: A sequence of integers separated by single spaces.
  length: 12 (observed constant in examples)

output_format:
  type: string
  description: A sequence of integers separated by single spaces, representing the transformed input.
  length: Same as input (12).

elements:
  - type: integer_sequence
    description: The underlying numerical data derived from parsing the input/output strings.
    properties:
      length: 12
  - type: integer_0
    description: Represents empty positions or background filler. Its count is adjusted based on non-zero element rearrangement.
  - type: non_zero_integers
    description: The elements actively involved in the transformation. Includes the pivot and others.
    properties:
      count_preservation: The count of each specific non-zero integer (e.g., number of 1s, 5s, 8s) is preserved between input and output.
  - type: pivot_element
    description: The central element for the mirroring operation.
    properties:
      value: 2
      position: Remains unchanged between the input and output sequence. Its index is the pivot_index.
  - type: other_non_zero_elements
    description: All non-zero integers in the sequence other than the pivot ('2').
    properties:
      position: Their position in the output sequence is determined by mirroring their original position relative to the pivot_index.

actions:
  - name: parse_input_string
    input: input_string
    output: input_integer_list
    description: Convert the space-separated string into a list of integers.
  - name: find_pivot_index
    input: input_integer_list
    output: pivot_index
    description: Locate the index of the pivot element (value 2).
  - name: identify_other_elements
    input: input_integer_list, pivot_index
    output: list_of_tuples (value, original_index)
    description: Create a list containing the value and original index of all non-zero elements *not* at the pivot_index.
  - name: initialize_output_list
    input: sequence_length
    output: output_integer_list
    description: Create a new list of the specified length, filled with zeros.
  - name: place_pivot_element
    input: output_integer_list, pivot_index, pivot_value (2)
    action: Assign the pivot_value to the output_integer_list at the pivot_index.
  - name: place_mirrored_elements
    input: output_integer_list, list_of_other_elements, pivot_index
    action:
      for each (value, original_index) in list_of_other_elements:
        calculate new_index = pivot_index + (pivot_index - original_index)
        if 0 <= new_index < length_of_list:
           assign value to output_integer_list at new_index
           # Note: Assumes no collisions or last-write priority based on examples.
  - name: format_output_string
    input: output_integer_list
    output: output_string
    description: Convert the final list of integers back into a space-separated string.

constraints:
  - The pivot element '2' must exist in the input sequence.
  - All calculated mirrored indices must fall within the bounds of the sequence length (0 to length-1). This appears guaranteed by the mirroring logic if the pivot is within bounds.
  - The input sequence length is constant in the examples (12).

goal: Transform the input string sequence into the output string sequence by parsing the input, fixing the position of '2', mirroring the positions of all other non-zero elements across '2', and formatting the result back into a string.
