            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The core logic identified previously (finding a pivot '2', finding a contiguous block of another non-zero digit, and mirroring the block's position relative to the pivot) appears sound based on the examples. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates that the code implementation incorrectly assumed the input would be a string requiring splitting, whereas the testing environment provided a NumPy array or a list-like structure directly. The strategy is to correct the input handling in the transformation logic and verify the mirroring calculation against all examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The `find_pivot` and `find_block` helper functions defined in the previous attempt correctly identify the necessary components. We can use them (adapted for list input) to analyze each example.\n\n    *   **train_1:**\n        *   input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]`\n        *   pivot_index: 6\n        *   block_val: 7, block_start_in: 9, block_end_in: 11, block_len: 3\n        *   block_relation: AFTER pivot\n        *   distance (pivot to block_start): `9 - 6 - 1 = 2`\n        *   new_block_end (mirroring distance before pivot): `6 - 2 - 1 = 3`\n        *   new_block_start: `3 - 3 + 1 = 1`\n        *   output: `[0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected)\n    *   **train_2:**\n        *   input: `[3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   pivot_index: 2\n        *   block_val: 3, block_start_in: 0, block_end_in: 1, block_len: 2\n        *   block_relation: BEFORE pivot\n        *   distance (block_end to pivot): `2 - 1 - 1 = 0`\n        *   new_block_start (mirroring distance after pivot): `2 + 0 + 1 = 3`\n        *   output: `[0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected)\n    *   **train_3:**\n        *   input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   pivot_index: 7\n        *   block_val: 3, block_start_in: 8, block_end_in: 8, block_len: 1\n        *   block_relation: AFTER pivot\n        *   distance (pivot to block_start): `8 - 7 - 1 = 0`\n        *   new_block_end (mirroring distance before pivot): `7 - 0 - 1 = 6`\n        *   new_block_start: `6 - 1 + 1 = 6`\n        *   output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected)\n    *   **train_4:**\n        *   input: `[0, 9, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   pivot_index: 4\n        *   block_val: 9, block_start_in: 1, block_end_in: 3, block_len: 3\n        *   block_relation: BEFORE pivot\n        *   distance (block_end to pivot): `4 - 3 - 1 = 0`\n        *   new_block_start (mirroring distance after pivot): `4 + 0 + 1 = 5`\n        *   output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected)\n    *   **train_5:**\n        *   input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   pivot_index: 4\n        *   block_val: 4, block_start_in: 5, block_end_in: 7, block_len: 3\n        *   block_relation: AFTER pivot\n        *   distance (pivot to block_start): `5 - 4 - 1 = 0`\n        *   new_block_end (mirroring distance before pivot): `4 - 0 - 1 = 3`\n        *   new_block_start: `3 - 3 + 1 = 1`\n        *   output: `[0, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected)\n    *   **train_6:**\n        *   input: `[5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   pivot_index: 3\n        *   block_val: 5, block_start_in: 0, block_end_in: 2, block_len: 3\n        *   block_relation: BEFORE pivot\n        *   distance (block_end to pivot): `3 - 2 - 1 = 0`\n        *   new_block_start (mirroring distance after pivot): `3 + 0 + 1 = 4`\n        *   output: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected)\n    *   **train_7:**\n        *   input: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   pivot_index: 5\n        *   block_val: 8, block_start_in: 2, block_end_in: 3, block_len: 2\n        *   block_relation: BEFORE pivot\n        *   distance (block_end to pivot): `5 - 3 - 1 = 1`\n        *   new_block_start (mirroring distance after pivot): `5 + 1 + 1 = 7`\n        *   output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]` (Matches expected)\n\n    The mirroring logic holds for all training examples.
