*   **General Assessment:**
    The core logic identified previously (finding a pivot '2', finding a contiguous block of another non-zero digit, and mirroring the block's position relative to the pivot) appears sound based on the examples. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates that the code implementation incorrectly assumed the input would be a string requiring splitting, whereas the testing environment provided a NumPy array or a list-like structure directly. The strategy is to correct the input handling in the transformation logic and verify the mirroring calculation against all examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    The `find_pivot` and `find_block` helper functions defined in the previous attempt correctly identify the necessary components. We can use them (adapted for list input) to analyze each example.

    The mirroring logic holds for all training examples. The distance calculation correctly uses the gap between the pivot and the *nearest* edge of the block.

  logic: |
    1. Identify the index of the pivot element '2' (idx_2).
    2. Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (not '2'):
       - Determine its value (block_val).
       - Find its start (block_start_in) and end (block_end_in) indices.
       - Calculate its length (block_len).
    3. Determine the relative position of the block to the pivot.
    4. Calculate the mirroring distance:
       - If the block is BEFORE the pivot (block_end_in < idx_2), distance = idx_2 - block_end_in - 1.
       - If the block is AFTER the pivot (block_start_in > idx_2), distance = block_start_in - idx_2 - 1.
    5. Calculate the new starting position (new_block_start) for the block in the output:
       - If the block was BEFORE, new_block_start = idx_2 + distance + 1.
       - If the block was AFTER, calculate new_block_end = idx_2 - distance - 1, then new_block_start = new_block_end - block_len + 1.
    6. Construct the output sequence:
       - Initialize with zeros.
       - Place the pivot '2' at idx_2.
       - Place the block (block_val repeated block_len times) starting at new_block_start.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Accept the input sequence (a list or array of 12 integers).
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length (12) with all zeros.
    3.  Find the index (`idx_2`) of the unique element with value `2` in the input sequence.
    4.  Place the value `2` at index `idx_2` in the output sequence.
    5.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (that are not `2`) in the input sequence. Determine its value (`block_val`), its starting index (`block_start_in`), its ending index (`block_end_in`), and its length (`block_len`).
    6.  Check if the block is positioned before or after the pivot in the input sequence.
    7.  **If** the block is *before* the pivot (`block_end_in < idx_2`):
        a.  Calculate the distance (`distance`) as the number of elements strictly between the end of the block and the pivot: `distance = idx_2 - block_end_in - 1`.
        b.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start`) for the block in the output sequence, placing it after the pivot with the same distance: `new_block_start = idx_2 + distance + 1`.
    8.  **Else** (the block is *after* the pivot, `block_start_in > idx_2`):
        a.  Calculate the distance (`distance`) as the number of elements strictly between the pivot and the start of the block: `distance = block_start_in - idx_2 - 1`.
        b.  Calculate the new ending index (`new_block_end`) for the block in the output sequence, placing it before the pivot with the same distance: `new_block_end = idx_2 - distance - 1`.
        c.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start`) based on the new end and block length: `new_block_start = new_block_end - block_len + 1`.
    9.  Fill the output sequence from `new_block_start` for `block_len` positions with the value `block_val`.
    10. Return the completed output sequence.
