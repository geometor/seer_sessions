"""
Mirrors the position of a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits 
relative to a fixed pivot digit '2' within a sequence of 12 integers. 
The mirroring preserves the distance (number of zeros, referred to as 'gap') 
between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block. If the block is 
initially before the pivot, it moves after the pivot in the output. If the 
block is initially after the pivot, it moves before the pivot in the output. 
All other positions in the output are filled with '0'.
