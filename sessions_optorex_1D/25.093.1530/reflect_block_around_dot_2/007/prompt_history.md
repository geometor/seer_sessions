*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains exactly one instance of the digit `2`.
    *   Each input sequence also contains one or more occurrences of another non-zero digit, forming a contiguous block. All other elements are `0`.
    *   The digit `2` acts as a fixed pivot; its position remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The contiguous block of the other non-zero digit ("the block") changes its position in the output relative to the pivot `2`.
    *   The transformation involves relocating the block based on its initial position relative to the pivot. The relative distance between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block seems preserved but mirrored.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed universally because it expected a string input (e.g., `"0 0 2 ..."`), while the testing environment likely provided list or array inputs (e.g., `[0, 0, 2, ...]`). The core logic involving finding a pivot '2' and mirroring a block of other digits relative to it seems sound based on the examples, but couldn't be executed. The immediate strategy is to correct the input handling within the helper functions (`find_pivot`, `find_block`) to accept sequences (lists/arrays) directly. Once this is done, we can verify the identification of the pivot and block, and then re-validate the mirroring calculation (preserving the gap between the pivot and the nearest block edge).

*   **Gather Metrics:**
    Executing the previous code failed due to input type mismatch. We will adapt the helper functions to work with lists and gather metrics on pivot/block identification and relative positioning for each training example.

    1. Identify the index of the pivot ('2').
    2. Identify the block (value, start index, end index, length).
    3. Determine if the block is 'before' or 'after' the pivot.
    4. Calculate the gap size (number of zeros) between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block.
    5. Calculate the new starting position for the block:
       - If originally 'before', the new start is pivot_idx + gap + 1.
       - If originally 'after', the new end is pivot_idx - gap - 1; the new start is new_end - block_len + 1.
    6. Construct the output sequence: Initialize with zeros, place the pivot at its original index, place the block at its new calculated position.
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: block
    object2: pivot
    condition: Determines the direction of movement (block_start_in < pivot_idx or block_start_in > pivot_idx). If before, moves after; if after, moves before.
  - type: distance_preservation
    object1: gap
    condition: The number of zeros between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block remains the same in the output, but on the opposite side of the pivot.
```


*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Receive the input sequence (a list of 12 integers).
    2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length, initialized with zeros.
    3.  Find the index (`pivot_idx`) of the digit `2` in the input sequence.
    4.  Place the digit `2` at `pivot_idx` in the output sequence.
    5.  Find the contiguous block of identical non-zero, non-`2` digits in the input sequence. Record its value (`block_val`), starting index (`block_start_in`), ending index (`block_end_in`), and length (`block_len`).
    6.  Determine the block's position relative to the pivot:
        *   If `block_end_in` < `pivot_idx`, the block is "before" the pivot.
        *   If `block_start_in` > `pivot_idx`, the block is "after" the pivot.
    7.  Calculate the gap size (number of zeros) between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block:
        *   If the block is "before", `gap = pivot_idx - block_end_in - 1`.
        *   If the block is "after", `gap = block_start_in - pivot_idx - 1`.
    8.  Calculate the starting index (`new_block_start`) for the block in the output sequence:
        *   If the block was originally "before", `new_block_start = pivot_idx + gap + 1`.
        *   If the block was originally "after", calculate the new end position `new_block_end = pivot_idx - gap - 1`, then `new_block_start = new_block_end - block_len + 1`.
    9.  Place the block in the output sequence: Fill the `block_len` positions starting from `new_block_start` with `block_val`.
    10. Return the completed output sequence.
