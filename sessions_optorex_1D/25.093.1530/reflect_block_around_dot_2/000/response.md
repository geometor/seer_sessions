*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains exactly one instance of the digit `2`.
    *   Each input sequence also contains one or more occurrences of another non-zero digit, forming a contiguous block. All other elements are `0`.
    *   The digit `2` acts as a fixed pivot; its position remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The contiguous block of the other non-zero digit ("the block") changes its position in the output relative to the pivot `2`.
    *   The transformation involves relocating the block based on its initial position relative to the pivot. The relative distance between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block seems preserved but mirrored.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Reposition a block of digits relative to a fixed pivot digit '2'.
    elements:
      - object: sequence
        properties:
          format: list of 12 integers (0-9)
          role: input/output container
      - object: pivot
        properties:
          value: 2
          occurrence: exactly one per sequence
          behavior: position is fixed between input and output
          identifier: idx_2 (index of the pivot)
      - object: block
        properties:
          value: non-zero integer (not 2)
          occurrence: one contiguous block per sequence
          structure: sequence of identical digits
          length: variable (>= 1)
          identifier: block_val, block_start_in, block_end_in, block_len
      - object: padding
        properties:
          value: 0
          role: fills remaining positions
    action:
      name: reposition_block
      inputs:
        - pivot (idx_2)
        - block (block_start_in, block_end_in, block_len, block_val)
        - input_sequence
      output: output_sequence
      logic: |
        The block's position is mirrored relative to the pivot, maintaining the distance
        between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block.
        If the block is initially before the pivot, it moves after the pivot.
        If the block is initially after the pivot, it moves before the pivot.
    relationships:
      - type: relative_position
        object1: block
        object2: pivot
        condition: Determines the direction of movement (block_start_in < idx_2 or block_start_in > idx_2).
      - type: distance
        object1: block (nearest edge)
        object2: pivot
        condition: Determines the placement offset in the output (abs(idx_2 - block_end_in) or abs(block_start_in - idx_2)).
