All other elements are `0`.\n    *   The digit `2` acts as a fixed pivot; its position remains unchanged from input to output.\n    *   The contiguous block of the other non-zero digit (\"the block\") changes its position in the output relative to the pivot `2`.\n    *   The transformation involves relocating the block based on its initial position relative to the pivot. The relative distance between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block seems preserved but mirrored.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
