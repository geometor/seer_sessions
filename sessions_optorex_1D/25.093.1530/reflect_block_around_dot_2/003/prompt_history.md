*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains exactly one instance of the digit `2`.
    *   Each input sequence also contains one or more occurrences of another non-zero digit, forming a contiguous block. All other elements are `0`.
    *   The digit `2` acts as a fixed pivot; its position remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The contiguous block of the other non-zero digit ("the block") changes its position in the output relative to the pivot `2`.
    *   The transformation involves relocating the block based on its initial position relative to the pivot. The relative distance between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block seems preserved but mirrored.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The core logic identified previously (finding a pivot '2', finding a contiguous block of another non-zero digit, and mirroring the block's position relative to the pivot) appears sound based on the examples. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates that the code implementation incorrectly assumed the input would be a string requiring splitting, whereas the testing environment provided a NumPy array or a list-like structure directly. The strategy is to correct the input handling in the transformation logic and verify the mirroring calculation against all examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    The `find_pivot` and `find_block` helper functions defined in the previous attempt correctly identify the necessary components. We can use them (adapted for list input) to analyze each example.

       - Calculate its length (block_len).
    3. Determine the relative position of the block to the pivot.
    4. Calculate the mirroring distance:
       - If the block is BEFORE the pivot (block_end_in < idx_2), distance = idx_2 - block_end_in - 1.
       - If the block is AFTER the pivot (block_start_in > idx_2), distance = block_start_in - idx_2 - 1.
    5. Calculate the new starting position (new_block_start) for the block in the output:
       - If the block was BEFORE, new_block_start = idx_2 + distance + 1.
       - If the block was AFTER, calculate new_block_end = idx_2 - distance - 1, then new_block_start = new_block_end - block_len + 1.
    6. Construct the output sequence:
       - Initialize with zeros.
       - Place the pivot '2' at idx_2.
       - Place the block (block_val repeated block_len times) starting at new_block_start.
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: block
    object2: pivot
    condition: Determines the mirroring direction (block_end_in < idx_2 or block_start_in > idx_2).
  - type: distance_mirroring
    object1: block (nearest edge)
    object2: pivot
    value: |
      The number of '0's strictly between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block.
      (abs(idx_2 - block_end_in) - 1 if block is before,
       abs(block_start_in - idx_2) - 1 if block is after)
    condition: This distance is preserved on the opposite side of the pivot when placing the block in the output.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

    1.  Accept the input sequence (a list or array of 12 integers).
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length (12) with all zeros.
    3.  Find the index (`idx_2`) of the unique element with value `2` in the input sequence.
    4.  Place the value `2` at index `idx_2` in the output sequence.
    5.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (that are not `2`) in the input sequence. Determine its value (`block_val`), its starting index (`block_start_in`), its ending index (`block_end_in`), and its length (`block_len`).
    6.  Check if the block is positioned before or after the pivot in the input sequence.
    7.  **If** the block is *before* the pivot (`block_end_in < idx_2`):
        a.  Calculate the distance (`distance`) as the number of elements strictly between the end of the block and the pivot: `distance = idx_2 - block_end_in - 1`.
        b.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start`) for the block in the output sequence, placing it after the pivot with the same distance: `new_block_start = idx_2 + distance + 1`.
    8.  **Else** (the block is *after* the pivot, `block_start_in > idx_2`):
        a.  Calculate the distance (`distance`) as the number of elements strictly between the pivot and the start of the block: `distance = block_start_in - idx_2 - 1`.
        b.  Calculate the new ending index (`new_block_end`) for the block in the output sequence, placing it before the pivot with the same distance: `new_block_end = idx_2 - distance - 1`.
        c.  Calculate the new starting index (`new_block_start`) based on the new end and block length: `new_block_start = new_block_end - block_len + 1`.
    9.  Fill the output sequence from `new_block_start` for `block_len` positions with the value `block_val`.
    10. Return the completed output sequence.
