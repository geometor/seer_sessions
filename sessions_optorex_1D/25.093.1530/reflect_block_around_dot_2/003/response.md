Reposition a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits relative to a fixed 
pivot digit '2' within a sequence of 12 integers. The block's position is 
mirrored across the pivot, maintaining the distance (number of zeros) between 
the pivot and the nearest edge of the block. If the block is initially before 
the pivot, it moves after the pivot in the output. If the block is initially 
after the pivot, it moves before the pivot in the output. All other positions 
in the output are filled with '0'.
