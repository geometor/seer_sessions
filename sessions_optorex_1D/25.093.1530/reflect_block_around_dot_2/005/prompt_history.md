*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains exactly one instance of the digit `2`.
    *   Each input sequence also contains one or more occurrences of another non-zero digit, forming a contiguous block. All other elements are `0`.
    *   The digit `2` acts as a fixed pivot; its position remains unchanged from input to output.
    *   The contiguous block of the other non-zero digit ("the block") changes its position in the output relative to the pivot `2`.
    *   The transformation involves relocating the block based on its initial position relative to the pivot. The relative distance between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block seems preserved but mirrored.

*   **YAML Facts:**

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: Pivot element '2' not found in the input grid.
## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code failed universally with the error "Pivot element '2' not found". Manual testing of the parsing logic (`[int(x) for x in input_grid_str.split()]`) and the core functions (`find_pivot`, `find_block`) confirmed they work correctly when given the space-separated string inputs shown in the examples. This strongly suggests the error arose from how the testing framework passed the input to the `transform` function. The framework likely provided the input as a pre-parsed list or array of integers, not the string the function expected.

The underlying logic (identify pivot '2', identify the contiguous block of another non-zero digit, calculate the gap/distance between the block and pivot, mirror the block to the other side of the pivot maintaining this gap) appears sound and consistent across all examples based on manual walkthroughs.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a list or array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step.
2.  Retain the core logic for finding the pivot, finding the block, calculating the distance (number of zeros between pivot and nearest block edge), and mirroring the block's position.
3.  Re-verify this logic against all examples mentally or with code snippets if necessary.
4.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the confirmed transformation rule, emphasizing the distance preservation and mirroring.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the core logic by recalculating the distance and new position for each example, assuming the input is already a list of integers.

*   `n`: length of sequence (always 12)
*   `pivot_idx`: index of the digit `2`
*   `block_val`, `block_start`, `block_end`, `block_len`: properties of the contiguous non-zero block (not `2`)
*   `distance`: number of zeros between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block.
*   `new_block_start`, `new_block_end`: calculated output position of the block.

The code execution confirms that the logic derived earlier (mirroring the block while preserving the distance/gap of zeros) correctly transforms the input to the output for all training examples.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_description: Mirror the position of a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits relative to a fixed pivot digit '2', preserving the distance (number of zeros) between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block.
input_format: List of 12 integers (0-9).
output_format: List of 12 integers (0-9).
constraints:
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one digit '2'.
  - Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical digits (value != 0 and != 2).
  - All other elements are '0'.
  - The block does not overlap or touch the pivot '2'.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      format: list of 12 integers (0-9)
      role: input/output container
      length: 12
  - object: pivot
    properties:
      value: 2
      occurrence: exactly one per sequence
      behavior: position is fixed between input and output
      identifier: pivot_idx (index of the pivot)
  - object: block
    properties:
      value: integer (val != 0 and val != 2)
      occurrence: one contiguous block per sequence
      structure: sequence of identical digits
      length: variable (>= 1)
      identifier: block_val, block_start_in, block_end_in, block_len
  - object: gap
    properties:
      value: 0
      role: fills positions between pivot and block, and remaining empty space
      identifier: distance (number of zeros between pivot and nearest block edge)
action:
  name: mirror_block_position
  inputs:
    - input_sequence (list of integers)
  output: output_sequence (list of integers)
  logic: |
    1. Initialize an output sequence of the same length (12) with all zeros.
    2. Locate the index of the pivot digit '2' (`pivot_idx`) in the input sequence.
    3. Place the pivot digit '2' at the same index (`pivot_idx`) in the output sequence.
    4. Locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (not '2') in the input sequence, determining its value (`block_val`), start index (`block_start_in`), end index (`block_end_in`), and length (`block_len`).
    5. Determine if the block is before or after the pivot in the input sequence.
    6. Calculate the distance (`distance`) as the number of zeros strictly between the pivot and the nearest edge of the block.
        - If block is before pivot (`block_end_in < pivot_idx`): `distance = pivot_idx - block_end_in - 1`
        - If block is after pivot (`block_start_in > pivot_idx`): `distance = block_start_in - pivot_idx - 1`
    7. Calculate the new start index (`new_block_start`) for the block in the output sequence by mirroring its position across the pivot, preserving the calculated `distance`.
        - If block was before pivot: `new_block_start = pivot_idx + distance + 1`
        - If block was after pivot: `new_block_end = pivot_idx - distance - 1`, `new_block_start = new_block_end - block_len + 1`
    8. Place the block (using `block_val` and `block_len`) into the output sequence starting at `new_block_start`.
    9. Ensure the final output sequence contains the placed pivot and the repositioned block, with all other positions filled with zeros.
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    object1: block
    object2: pivot
    condition: Determines the direction of mirroring (block before pivot vs. block after pivot).
  - type: separation_distance
    object1: block (nearest edge)
    object2: pivot
    measure: Number of zeros between them (`distance`).
    condition: This distance is preserved during the mirroring transformation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new list (the output) of the same size as the input list (12 elements), initially filled with zeros.
2.  **Find Pivot:** Locate the index of the number `2` (the pivot) in the input list. Place the number `2` at this same index in the output list.
3.  **Find Block:** Identify the contiguous sequence (block) of identical numbers in the input list that are not `0` and not `2`. Record the block's number (value), its starting index, its ending index, and its length.
4.  **Calculate Gap:** Determine the number of zeros (`distance`) that lie strictly between the pivot's index and the nearest index of the block in the input list.
5.  **Determine New Position:**
    *   If the block was *before* the pivot in the input: Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output by placing it *after* the pivot, separated by the same `distance` (number of zeros). The new start index will be `pivot_index + distance + 1`.
    *   If the block was *after* the pivot in the input: Calculate the new ending index for the block in the output by placing it *before* the pivot, separated by the same `distance` (number of zeros). The new end index will be `pivot_index - distance - 1`. Then, calculate the new starting index based on this new end index and the block's length (`new_start_index = new_end_index - block_length + 1`).
6.  **Place Block:** Fill the calculated range of indices in the output list with the block's number (value).
7.  **Finalize:** The output list now contains the pivot and the mirrored block, with all other positions as zeros. Return this output list.
