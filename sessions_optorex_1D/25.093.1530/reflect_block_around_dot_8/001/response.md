"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers based on a reflection rule centered around the element '2'.

1.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initialized with zeros.
2.  Find the index of the element '2' (the pivot) in the input sequence.
3.  Place the value '2' into the output sequence at the same pivot index.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence.
5.  For each non-zero element that is not '2', calculate its new index by reflecting its position across the pivot index. The formula for the new index is `(2 * pivot_index) - current_index`.
6.  Place the non-zero, non-pivot element into the output sequence at its calculated new index.
7.  Return the completed output sequence.
