Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Elements:** The sequences contain digits, with '0' appearing frequently. Other non-zero digits also appear.
3.  **Role of '0':** The digit '0' seems to act as a background or empty placeholder.
4.  **Non-Zero Elements:** The non-zero digits from the input are all present in the output. Their values remain unchanged, but their positions often shift.
5.  **Special Element '2':** The digit '2' is present in every example pair. Observing its position reveals it *never moves* from its input index to its output index.
6.  **Transformation Pattern:** The positions of all other non-zero elements appear to be reflected or mirrored across the position of the '2'. If a non-zero element (other than '2') is `k` positions to the left of '2' in the input, it appears `k` positions to the right of '2' in the output. Conversely, if it's `k` positions to the right, it moves `k` positions to the left.
7.  **Output Construction:** The output sequence starts conceptually empty (or filled with zeros). The '2' is placed first at its original position. Then, the other non-zero elements are placed according to the reflection rule. Positions not filled by these elements remain '0'.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new sequence (the "output sequence") of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled entirely with zeros.
2.  Find the index (let's call it `pivot_index`) of the element with the value '2' in the input sequence.
3.  Place the value '2' into the output sequence at the same `pivot_index`.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence, examining each element `x` at its index `i`.
5.  If the element `x` is not zero and its value is not '2':
    a.  Calculate the target index (`new_index`) for this element in the output sequence using the formula: `new_index = (2 * pivot_index) - i`.
    b.  Place the element `x` into the output sequence at the calculated `new_index`.
6.  Return the completed output sequence.
```python
import math

"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers based on a reflection rule centered around the element '2'.

1.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initialized with zeros.
2.  Find the index of the element '2' (the pivot) in the input sequence.
3.  Place the value '2' into the output sequence at the same pivot index.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence.
5.  For each non-zero element that is not '2', calculate its new index by reflecting its position across the pivot index. The formula for the new index is `(2 * pivot_index) - current_index`.
6.  Place the non-zero, non-pivot element into the output sequence at its calculated new index.
7.  Return the completed output sequence.
