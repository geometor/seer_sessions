Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Elements:** The sequences contain digits, with '0' appearing frequently. Other non-zero digits also appear.
3.  **Role of '0':** The digit '0' seems to act as a background or empty placeholder.
4.  **Non-Zero Elements:** The non-zero digits from the input are all present in the output. Their values remain unchanged, but their positions often shift.
5.  **Special Element '2':** The digit '2' is present in every example pair. Observing its position reveals it *never moves* from its input index to its output index.
6.  **Transformation Pattern:** The positions of all other non-zero elements appear to be reflected or mirrored across the position of the '2'. If a non-zero element (other than '2') is `k` positions to the left of '2' in the input, it appears `k` positions to the right of '2' in the output. Conversely, if it's `k` positions to the right, it moves `k` positions to the left.
7.  **Output Construction:** The output sequence starts conceptually empty (or filled with zeros). The '2' is placed first at its original position. Then, the other non-zero elements are placed according to the reflection rule. Positions not filled by these elements remain '0'.

**Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new sequence (the "output sequence") of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled entirely with zeros.
2.  Find the index (let's call it `pivot_index`) of the element with the value '2' in the input sequence.
3.  Place the value '2' into the output sequence at the same `pivot_index`.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence, examining each element `x` at its index `i`.
5.  If the element `x` is not zero and its value is not '2':
    a.  Calculate the target index (`new_index`) for this element in the output sequence using the formula: `new_index = (2 * pivot_index) - i`.
    b.  Place the element `x` into the output sequence at the calculated `new_index`.
6.  Return the completed output sequence.
