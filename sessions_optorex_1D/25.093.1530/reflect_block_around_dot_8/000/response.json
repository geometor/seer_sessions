Other non-zero digits also appear.\n3.  **Role of '0':** The digit '0' seems to act as a background or empty placeholder.\n4.  **Non-Zero Elements:** The non-zero digits from the input are all present in the output. Their values remain unchanged, but their positions often shift.\n5.  **Special Element '2':** The digit '2' is present in every example pair. Observing its position reveals it *never moves* from its input index to its output index.\n6.  **Transformation Pattern:** The positions of all other non-zero elements appear to be reflected or mirrored across the position of the '2'. If a non-zero element (other than '2') is `k` positions to the left of '2' in the input, it appears `k` positions to the right of '2' in the output. Conversely, if it's `k` positions to the right, it moves `k` positions to the left.\n7.  **Output Construction:** The output sequence starts conceptually empty (or filled with zeros). The '2' is placed first at its original position. Then, the other non-zero elements are placed according to the reflection rule. Positions not filled by these elements remain '0'.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
