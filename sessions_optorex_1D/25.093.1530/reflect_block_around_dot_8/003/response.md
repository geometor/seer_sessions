```python
"""
Transforms an input 1D NumPy array of 12 integers based on a reflection rule centered around the element '2'.

1.  Create a new NumPy array (the "output sequence") of length 12, initialized with zeros.
2.  Find the index (pivot_index) of the element with the value '2' in the input sequence using NumPy's `where` function.
3.  Place the value '2' into the output sequence at the pivot_index.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence, examining each element `value` at its original index `i`.
5.  If the `value` is not zero and is not equal to '2':
    a.  Calculate the target index (`new_index`) for this element in the output sequence using the reflection formula: `new_index = (2 * pivot_index) - i`.
    b.  Place the `value` into the output sequence at the calculated `new_index`.
6.  Return the completed output sequence as a NumPy array.
