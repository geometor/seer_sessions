Use a.any() or a.all()` consistently occurs across all examples. This error arises in NumPy when a boolean condition (like in an `if` statement) is applied to an array containing multiple boolean values (e.g., `[True, False, True]`) instead of a single scalar `True` or `False`.\n\nGiven the code structure:\n"

            "text": "\nThe most likely cause is that `value` within the loop is not a scalar integer as expected, but rather a NumPy array. This typically happens if `input_sequence`, assumed to be a 1D array (vector) of shape `(12,)`, is actually being passed as a 2D array with a single row, shape `(1, 12)`. When `enumerate` iterates over a 2D array, it yields *rows* (which are 1D arrays). Comparing a row array `value != 0` results in a boolean array (e.g., `[True, False, True, ...]`), which cannot be evaluated as a single condition in the `if` statement, triggering the error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** The core transformation logic (reflection around the pivot '2') appears correct based on the examples. The primary issue seems to be a mismatch between the expected input structure (1D array) and the structure potentially used during testing (2D array).\n2.  **Refine Implementation (Coder Phase):** The coder will need to ensure the `transform` function correctly handles the input. This could involve:\n    *   Adding an assertion or check at the beginning of the function to verify `input_sequence.ndim == 1`.\n    *   Attempting to reshape the input if it's 2D with one row (e.g., `input_sequence = input_sequence.flatten()` or `input_sequence = input_sequence[0]` if shape is `(1, N)`).\n    *   Assuming the test harness provides the correct 1D input as per the problem description.\n3.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The natural language program and the fundamental reflection logic remain unchanged, as they correctly describe the transformation observed in the examples, assuming the input is processed as a 1D sequence.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nAssuming the input is correctly handled as a 1D array/list, let's re-verify the logic:\n\n*   **Pivot Identification:** The pivot is consistently the digit '2'. Its index varies across examples.\n    *   `train_1`: index 3\n    *   `train_2`: index 8\n    *   `train_3`: index 3\n    *   `train_4`: index 5\n    *   `train_5`: index 4\n    *   `train_6`: index 6\n    *   `train_7`: index 3\n*   **Pivot Position:** The pivot '2' retains its original index in the output in all examples.\n*   **Reflection Logic:** Non-zero, non-pivot elements change position based on their distance from the pivot.\n    *   Formula: `new_index = pivot_index + (pivot_index - old_index) = 2 * pivot_index - old_index`\n    *   Example `train_1`: Input `[0, 9, 0, 2, ...]`. Pivot index = 3. Element 9 at index 1. `new_index = 2 * 3 - 1 = 5`. Output `[..., 2, 0, 9, ...]`. Correct.\n    *   Example `train_4`: Input `[..., 2, 4, 4, ...]`. Pivot index = 5. Element 4 at index 6. `new_index = 2 * 5 - 6 = 4`. Output `[..., 4, 2, ...]`. Correct. Element 4 at index 7. `new_index = 2 * 5 - 7 = 3`. Output `[..., 4, 4, 2, ...]`. Correct.\n*   **Zero Handling:** Zeros act as background/placeholders and fill any positions not occupied by the pivot or reflected elements.\n\nThe core transformation logic holds true for all provided examples. The reported errors stem from the Python/NumPy implementation interacting with the assumed input format during testing, not from a flaw in the transformation rule itself.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
