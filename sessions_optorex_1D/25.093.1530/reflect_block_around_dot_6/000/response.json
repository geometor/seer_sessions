Crucially, its position (index) within the sequence remains unchanged from input to output.\n4.  **Mobile Elements:** The non-zero integers other than `2` change their positions. `0`s act as placeholders or padding.\n5.  **Transformation Pattern:** The number `2` acts as a pivot or separator. The block of non-zero numbers (excluding `2`) found *before* the `2` in the input sequence is moved to occupy the positions *after* the `2` in the output sequence. Conversely, the block of non-zero numbers found *after* the `2` in the input sequence is moved to occupy the positions *before* the `2` in the output sequence.\n6.  **Order Preservation:** Within the block of numbers moved from before `2` to after `2`, their relative order is preserved. Similarly, the relative order is preserved for the numbers moved from after `2` to before `2`.\n7.  **Padding:** Zeros (`0`) fill all positions in the output sequence not occupied by the `2` or the relocated non-zero numbers. The placement ensures the moved blocks are adjacent to the `2`.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Create a new, empty list called `before_elements`. Iterate through the input sequence from the beginning up to (but not including) index `p`. If an element is not zero, append it to `before_elements`.\n4.  Create another new, empty list called `after_elements`. Iterate through the input sequence starting from the element after index `p` until the end. If an element is not zero, append it to `after_elements`.\n5.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 integers, filling all positions with `0`.\n6.  Place the integer `2` into the output sequence at index `p`.\n7.  Place the contents of the `after_elements` list into the output sequence, ending at index `p-1`. Specifically, they occupy indices from `p - length(after_elements)` to `p - 1`.\n8.  Place the contents of the `before_elements` list into the output sequence, starting at index `p+1`. Specifically, they occupy indices from `p + 1` to `p + length(before_elements)`.\n9.  The resulting sequence is the final output."
