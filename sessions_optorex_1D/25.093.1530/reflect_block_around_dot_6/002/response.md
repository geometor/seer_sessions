## General Assessment

The previous code attempt failed because it assumed the input sequence was a standard Python `list`, while the execution environment provided it as a `numpy.ndarray`. NumPy arrays do not have the `.index()` method used to find the pivot element '2'. The core transformation logic identified previously (using '2' as a pivot, swapping non-zero elements from before/after the pivot while preserving their relative order) appears correct based on the visual inspection of the input/output pairs.

The strategy to resolve this is to modify the implementation to correctly handle NumPy arrays. This involves:
1.  Using NumPy functions like `np.where()` to find the index of the pivot element.
2.  Using NumPy array slicing and boolean indexing for extracting non-zero elements.
3.  Initializing the output as a NumPy array.

## Metrics

Re-evaluating the examples confirms the initial perception:

*   **Consistency:** All examples involve a 12-element sequence.
*   **Pivot:** The number `2` is present exactly once in all inputs and its position is unchanged in the output.
*   **Non-Zero Elements:** Other non-zero digits (5, 7, 8, 9) appear.
*   **Transformation:** Elements non-zero and before `2` in the input appear non-zero and after `2` in the output, maintaining relative order. Elements non-zero and after `2` in the input appear non-zero and before `2` in the output, maintaining relative order.
*   **Zero Padding:** Zeros fill the remaining spaces.

Let's confirm the index finding and element extraction logic mentally for `train_1`:

*   `input`: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Assuming list for logic check)
*   `pivot_index` of `2` is 6.
*   `elements_before`: `[8]` (from `input[0:6]`)
*   `elements_after`: `[]` (from `input[7:12]`)
*   `output` initialized as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Place `2` at index 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Place `elements_after` (empty) before index 6: No change.
*   Place `elements_before` (`[8]`) after index 6 (starting at 7): `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]` - **This does not match the expected output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`**.

**Correction:** My previous analysis/implementation had a slight error in placement logic. The blocks are not placed immediately next to the pivot, but rather fill the available space on their new side, maintaining their relative order. Let's re-examine `train_1`:

*   `input`: `[0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   `output`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`
*   `pivot_index` = 6.
*   `before_elements` = `[8]`. These need to go into the `after` section of the output (`output[7:]`).
*   `after_elements` = `[]`. These need to go into the `before` section of the output (`output[0:6]`).
*   Output construction:
    *   Initialize: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Place pivot `2` at index 6: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Place `after_elements` `[]` into indices `0` to `6 - len([]) - 1 = 5`: No change.
    *   Place `before_elements` `[8]` into indices `6 + 1 = 7` to `12 - 1 = 11`, filling from the end? Let's rethink.

**Revised Placement Logic:** The blocks seem to be *right-aligned* on their new side.

*   `train_1`: `[8]` moves to the right side (`output[7:12]`). It's placed at the end: `output[11] = 8`.
*   `train_2`: Input `[0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0]`
    *   `pivot_index` = 5.
    *   `before` = `[8, 8, 8, 8]`. Moves to right side (`output[6:12]`). Right-aligned: `output[6:10] = [8, 8, 8, 8]`.
    *   `after` = `[]`. Moves to left side (`output[0:5]`). Right-aligned: No change.
*   `train_3`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   `pivot_index` = 5.
    *   `before` = `[]`. Moves to right side (`output[6:12]`). Right-aligned: No change.
    *   `after` = `[5, 5, 5]`. Moves to left side (`output[0:5]`). Right-aligned: `output[2:5] = [5, 5, 5]`.
*   `train_4`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 0, 0]`, Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   `pivot_index` = 8.
    *   `before` = `[]`. Moves to right side (`output[9:12]`). Right-aligned: No change.
    *   `after` = `[9]`. Moves to left side (`output[0:8]`). Right-aligned: `output[7] = 9`.

This "right-alignment" seems consistent across examples. The elements originally *before* the pivot fill the available slots *after* the pivot in the output, starting from the rightmost available slot and moving left. The elements originally *after* the pivot fill the available slots *before* the pivot in the output, starting from the rightmost available slot (just before the pivot) and moving left.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence as a NumPy array of 12 integers.
2.  Locate the index (position) of the integer `2`. Let this index be `pivot_index`.
3.  Extract all non-zero integers from the input array *before* `pivot_index`, preserving their relative order. Store these in a temporary list or array called `elements_before`.
4.  Extract all non-zero integers from the input array *after* `pivot_index`, preserving their relative order. Store these in a temporary list or array called `elements_after`.
5.  Initialize a new NumPy output array of 12 integers, filling all positions with `0`.
6.  Place the integer `2` into the output array at `pivot_index`.
7.  Determine the number of elements in `elements_after`, let it be `len_after`. Calculate the starting index for placement as `start_index_after = pivot_index - len_after`. Place the contents of `elements_after` into the output array from `start_index_after` up to (but not including) `pivot_index`.
8.  Determine the number of elements in `elements_before`, let it be `len_before`. Calculate the starting index for placement as `start_index_before = 12 - len_before`. Place the contents of `elements_before` into the output array from `start_index_before` up to the end of the array (index 11).
9.  Return the resulting output array.
