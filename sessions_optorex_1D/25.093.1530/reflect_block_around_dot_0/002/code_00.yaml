task_type: sequence_transformation
input_type: numpy_ndarray # Corrected based on errors
output_type: list_of_integers # Or numpy_ndarray, assuming consistency is desired
input_structure: Potentially 2D array of shape (1, 12), needs flattening or access via index [0]. Assumed to represent a 1D sequence.
sequence_length: 12
elements:
  - type: background
    value: 0
  - type: pivot_element
    value: 2
    behavior: remains in its original position
  - type: movable_elements
    value: non-zero integers other than 2
    behavior: position is reflected across the pivot element
processing:
  - preprocess_input: Ensure input is treated as a flat 1D sequence of length 12 (e.g., flatten if shape is (1, 12), convert to list or use NumPy functions).
  - identify_pivot: find the index 'p2' of the element '2' using appropriate method (e.g., `np.where(arr == 2)[0][0]` or `list.index(2)` after conversion).
  - identify_segments: find contiguous sequences of movable_elements in the flattened input sequence.
  - reflect_segments:
      for each segment from original index 'start' to 'end':
        calculate new start index 'start_out' = 2 * p2 - end
        place the segment's numbers starting at 'start_out' in the output
  - construct_output: start with a sequence of zeros (list or NumPy array), place the pivot element at 'p2', then place the reflected segments. Return the final sequence in the required format.
constraints:
  - input is a NumPy array, potentially shape (1, 12).
  - exactly one element with value 2 exists in the logical sequence.
  - output sequence must have length 12.
  - reflection preserves the order of elements within a segment.
