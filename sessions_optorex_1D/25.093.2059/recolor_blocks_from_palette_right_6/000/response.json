The length of the sequence remains constant (12 in all examples).\n2.  **Key Numbers:** The number `5` appears consistently in the input sequences and seems to be the primary target for modification. The number `0` acts as a separator or placeholder and is generally unchanged.\n3.  **Replacement Source:** The non-zero numbers at the beginning of the input sequence seem to define the values used to replace the `5`s.\n4.  **Replacement Pattern:** The replacement doesn't happen for individual `5`s but for contiguous blocks (sequences) of `5`s.\n5.  **Cyclical Replacement:** When there are multiple non-zero numbers at the start of the input and multiple blocks of `5`s later in the sequence, the replacement values seem to cycle through the initial non-zero numbers. For instance, in `train_2`, the first block of `5`s is replaced by `6`, the second by `8`, and the third by `1`, corresponding to the initial sequence `6 8 1`.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Length is fixed (12).\n  - Output_Sequence:\n      Type: List of integers\n      Properties: Same length as Input_Sequence. Derived from Input_Sequence.\n  - Replacement_Pool:\n      Type: List of integers\n      Derivation: Extracted from the beginning of the Input_Sequence, containing consecutive non-zero numbers starting from the first element.\n  - Target_Number:\n      Value: 5\n      Role: The number to be replaced within the Input_Sequence.\n  - Target_Blocks:\n      Type: List of lists (or list of ranges)\n      Derivation: Contiguous sequences of the Target_Number (5) found within the Input_Sequence (excluding the elements that form the Replacement_Pool).\n  - Filler_Number:\n      Value: 0\n      Role: Seems to act as a separator or padding, generally remains unchanged.\n\nRelationships:\n  - Output_Sequence is generated by modifying Input_Sequence.\n  - Elements in Output_Sequence maintain their position unless they are part of a Target_Block.\n  - Each Target_Block in the Input_Sequence is replaced by a single value from the Replacement_Pool.\n  - The replacement values are assigned to Target_Blocks sequentially using the numbers from the Replacement_Pool, cycling back to the start of the pool if necessary.\n\nActions:\n  1. Identify the Replacement_Pool from the start of the Input_Sequence.\n  2. Scan the rest of the Input_Sequence to locate Target_Blocks (contiguous sequences of 5).\n  3. Iterate through the identified Target_Blocks.\n  4. For each Target_Block, select the next value from the Replacement_Pool (cycling if needed).\n  5. Replace all numbers within that Target_Block with the selected value.\n  6.
