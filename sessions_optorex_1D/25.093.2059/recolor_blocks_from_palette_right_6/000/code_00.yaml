Task: Replace blocks of a specific number (5) with values derived from the initial part of the sequence.

Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      Type: List of integers
      Properties: Contains numbers, including 0, 5, and others. Length is fixed (12).
  - Output_Sequence:
      Type: List of integers
      Properties: Same length as Input_Sequence. Derived from Input_Sequence.
  - Replacement_Pool:
      Type: List of integers
      Derivation: Extracted from the beginning of the Input_Sequence, containing consecutive non-zero numbers starting from the first element.
  - Target_Number:
      Value: 5
      Role: The number to be replaced within the Input_Sequence.
  - Target_Blocks:
      Type: List of lists (or list of ranges)
      Derivation: Contiguous sequences of the Target_Number (5) found within the Input_Sequence (excluding the elements that form the Replacement_Pool).
  - Filler_Number:
      Value: 0
      Role: Seems to act as a separator or padding, generally remains unchanged.

Relationships:
  - Output_Sequence is generated by modifying Input_Sequence.
  - Elements in Output_Sequence maintain their position unless they are part of a Target_Block.
  - Each Target_Block in the Input_Sequence is replaced by a single value from the Replacement_Pool.
  - The replacement values are assigned to Target_Blocks sequentially using the numbers from the Replacement_Pool, cycling back to the start of the pool if necessary.

Actions:
  1. Identify the Replacement_Pool from the start of the Input_Sequence.
  2. Scan the rest of the Input_Sequence to locate Target_Blocks (contiguous sequences of 5).
  3. Iterate through the identified Target_Blocks.
  4. For each Target_Block, select the next value from the Replacement_Pool (cycling if needed).
  5. Replace all numbers within that Target_Block with the selected value.
  6. Copy all other numbers (non-5s and 0s outside the initial pool) directly from the Input_Sequence to the Output_Sequence.
