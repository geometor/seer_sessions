The length of the sequence remains constant from input to output.\n2.  **Key Numbers:** The numbers `0` and `5` appear to play special roles. `0` often acts as a boundary or separator. `5` appears to be a placeholder value that might be replaced. Other non-zero digits seem to serve as replacement values.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves replacing consecutive sequences of `5`s. The replacement value is determined by specific non-zero digits that appear *before* the first sequence of `5`s in the input. The position of the `5`s sequence corresponds to the position of the replacement digit in the initial prefix. If the potential replacement digit is `5`, no replacement occurs for that specific sequence of `5`s.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
