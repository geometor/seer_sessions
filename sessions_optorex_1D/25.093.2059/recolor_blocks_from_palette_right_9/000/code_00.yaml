Task: Replace placeholder segments based on preceding values.

Input:
  Type: Sequence of integers.
  Properties:
    - Contains digits 0-9.
    - Contains segments of consecutive '5's.
    - Contains '0's acting as potential separators.
    - Contains other non-zero digits.

Output:
  Type: Sequence of integers.
  Properties:
    - Same length as the input sequence.
    - Some segments of '5's from the input might be replaced by other digits.
    - Other digits usually remain unchanged.

Objects:
  - IntegerSequence: The primary data structure (input and output).
  - PlaceholderSegment: A consecutive subsequence composed entirely of the digit '5'.
  - ReplacementCandidateSource: The portion of the input sequence preceding the first PlaceholderSegment.
  - ReplacementValue: A non-zero digit extracted from the ReplacementCandidateSource.
  - Separator: The digit '0', which might delimit segments but doesn't directly influence replacement logic other than being ignored as a ReplacementValue.

Relationships_Actions:
  - Identify: Locate all PlaceholderSegments (sequences of '5's) in the input sequence.
  - Extract: Collect all non-zero digits from the ReplacementCandidateSource (the part of the input before the first '5' appears).
  - Map: Associate the k-th PlaceholderSegment with the k-th extracted non-zero digit (ReplacementValue).
  - Conditional Replace: For each PlaceholderSegment:
      - If a corresponding ReplacementValue exists AND the ReplacementValue is NOT '5', replace all digits within the PlaceholderSegment with the ReplacementValue.
      - Otherwise, leave the PlaceholderSegment unchanged.

Example_Focus (train_7):
  - Input: `5 8 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0`
  - PlaceholderSegments: `S1 = (5, 5)` at index 4, `S2 = (5, 5)` at index 8.
  - ReplacementCandidateSource: `5 8 0 0` (before index 4).
  - Extracted ReplacementValues: `C1 = 5`, `C2 = 8`.
  - Action S1 (k=1): Map to C1=5. Since C1 is 5, S1 remains `5 5`.
  - Action S2 (k=2): Map to C2=8. Since C2 is not 5, S2 becomes `8 8`.
  - Output: `5 8 0 0 5 5 0 0 8 8 0 0`
