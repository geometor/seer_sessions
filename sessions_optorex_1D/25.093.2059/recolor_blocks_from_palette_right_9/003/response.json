Identifies all maximal consecutive segments of the digit '5' in the input sequence.\n2. Finds the index of the first occurrence of the digit '5'. If '5' is not present, the input is returned unchanged.\n3. Extracts all non-zero digits that appear in the input sequence *before* the index of the first '5'. These form an ordered list of 'replacement candidates'.\n4. Iterates through the identified segments of '5's (S_1, S_2, ..., S_N) and the replacement candidates (C_1, C_2, ..., C_M).\n5. For the k-th segment of '5's (S_k):\n   a. If a corresponding k-th replacement candidate (C_k) exists (i.e., k <= M) AND C_k is not equal to 5:\n      Replace all digits within segment S_k with the value C_k.\n   b. Otherwise (if k > M, or if C_k is equal to 5), leave the segment S_k unchanged.\n6.
