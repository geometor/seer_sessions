**General Assessment**

The primary issue identified in the previous execution was a mismatch between the expected input type (string) and the actual input type provided by the execution environment (likely a NumPy array or list of integers). This caused `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.

Beyond the type error, a re-evaluation of the transformation logic against all examples, particularly `train_7`, revealed a nuance in how the "replacement candidates" are determined. The initial hypothesis (candidates are non-zero digits before the *very first* '5') failed for inputs starting with '5'. The refined hypothesis is that the candidates are determined based on the non-zero digits preceding the *first segment of '5's that does not start at index 0*. Segments of '5's are then mapped sequentially to these candidates, and replacement occurs only if the corresponding candidate exists and is not '5'.

The strategy is to:
1.  Correct the input handling to accept a list/array of integers.
2.  Implement the refined logic for determining candidates and applying replacements.
3.  Verify this logic against all provided examples.

**Metrics and Verification**

Let's verify the refined hypothesis using `tool_code`. We'll define helper functions based on the refined logic and apply them to each training example.
