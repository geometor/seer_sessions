            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the transformation logic identified in the previous phase. The core logic involves:\n1.  Identifying the first two elements (`key1`, `key2`).\n2.  Finding contiguous blocks of the digit `5`.\n3.  Replacing the first block of `5`s with `key1`.\n4.  Replacing the second block of `5`s with `key2`.\n\nThe execution results indicate that the `transform` function consistently returned the original input sequence unchanged, despite the logic appearing correct in the code structure (`np.copy` and slice assignment). This suggests a potential issue either in the execution environment/test harness interaction (e.g., how the modified array is handled or returned) or a subtle flaw in the NumPy slice assignment step within that specific context, even though the syntax `output_sequence[start:end] = value` is standard for broadcasting a value to a slice.\n\nThe strategy is to reaffirm the transformation logic based on the examples, verify the intermediate steps (key/block identification) are correct, and refine the natural language program. The implementation details will need careful review in the subsequent coder phase.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nBased on the analysis and tool execution:\n\n| Example | Input                     | Keys (k1, k2) | Target Blocks (index, len) | Num Blocks | Expected Output Modification                                   |\n| :------ | :------------------------ | :------------ | :------------------------- | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| train_1 | `9 7 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0` | (9, 7)        | `[(4, 3), (8, 3)]`         | 2          | Indices 4-6 replace with 9, Indices 8-10 replace with 7        |\n| train_2 | `6 7 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5` | (6, 7)        | `[(5, 3), (9, 3)]`         | 2          | Indices 5-7 replace with 6, Indices 9-11 replace with 7        |\n| train_3 | `2 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` | (2, 0)        | `[(3, 2)]`                 | 1          | Indices 3-4 replace with 2, (Second block rule not applicable) |\n| train_4 | `1 3 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 0` | (1, 3)        | `[(3, 2), (7, 2)]`         | 2          | Indices 3-4 replace with 1, Indices 7-8 replace with 3         |\n| train_5 | `3 2 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0` | (3, 2)        | `[(6, 2), (9, 2)]`         | 2          | Indices 6-7 replace with 3, Indices 9-10 replace with 2        |\n| train_6 | `2 7 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5` | (2, 7)        | `[(5, 3), (9, 3)]`         | 2          | Indices 5-7 replace with 2, Indices 9-11 replace with 7        |\n| train_7 | `3 7 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5` | (3, 7)        | `[(5, 3), (9, 3)]`         | 2          | Indices 5-7 replace with 3, Indices 9-11 replace with 7        |\n| test_1  | `7 3 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5` | (7, 3)        | `[(4, 3), (9, 3)]`         | 2          | Indices 4-6 replace with 7, Indices 9-11 replace with 3        |\n\nThe metrics confirm that the understanding of where replacements should occur and with which values aligns perfectly with the expected outputs across all examples. The failure is not in the logic but likely in the execution or implementation details of the previous code attempt.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
