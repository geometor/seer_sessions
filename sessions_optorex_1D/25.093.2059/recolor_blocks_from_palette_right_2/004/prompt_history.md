## Perception

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The core transformation appears to target sequences of the digit '5'. The first two digits of the input sequence play a special role in determining the replacement values for these '5' sequences. Other digits, particularly '0', seem to remain unchanged in their positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Identify the first number in the input sequence as `key1`.
3.  Identify the second number in the input sequence as `key2`.
4.  Find all contiguous blocks (sequences) of the number 5 in the input sequence, noting their starting positions and lengths.
5.  If at least one block of 5s exists:
    *   Take the first identified block of 5s.
    *   Replace the elements in the output sequence corresponding to this block's position and length with the value `key1`.
6.  If at least two blocks of 5s exist:
    *   Take the second identified block of 5s.
    *   Replace the elements in the output sequence corresponding to this block's position and length with the value `key2`.
7.  Return the modified output sequence.

Transforms a sequence of integers based on the first two numbers and blocks of '5's.

1.  Parses the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Identifies the first number (`key1`) and second number (`key2`) from the list.
3.  Finds all contiguous blocks (sequences) of the number 5 in the input list.
4.  Initializes the output list as a copy of the input list.
5.  If at least one block of 5s is found, replaces the elements in the output list corresponding to the *first* block with `key1`.
