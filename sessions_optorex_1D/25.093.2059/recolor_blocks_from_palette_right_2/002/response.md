## General Assessment

The primary error across all examples is `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates that the `transform` function was designed assuming a string input (`input_str`) which needed parsing via `.split()`, while the actual input provided during testing is a NumPy array.

The strategy for resolution is straightforward:
1.  Modify the `transform` function signature to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers, as NumPy arrays can be easily converted) directly.
2.  Remove the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).
3.  Ensure the core logic (identifying keys, finding blocks of 5, replacing blocks) operates correctly on the list/array data structure.
4.  Adjust the return type to match the expected output format, likely a NumPy array or list of integers, instead of a space-separated string.

The underlying logic of identifying the first two elements as keys and replacing the first and second contiguous blocks of '5's with these keys, respectively, appears sound based on the initial examples and the simulation performed mentally. The error is purely an input type mismatch.

## Metrics Gathering

We will use `tool_code` to simulate the core logic steps on the provided examples, assuming the input is a list of integers (as derived from the NumPy array).

        if sequence[i] == target_value:

            while i < n and sequence[i] == target_value:

The metrics confirm that the core logic (finding keys, finding blocks of 5s, replacing the first block with key1 and the second block with key2) correctly transforms the input list to the expected output list for all provided training examples. The only necessary correction is to handle the input as a list/array instead of a string.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input sequence (which is a list or array of integers).
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
3.  Identify the first element (at index 0) of the input sequence as `key1`.
4.  Identify the second element (at index 1) of the input sequence as `key2`.
5.  Find all contiguous blocks (sequences) of the number 5 within the input sequence, recording the starting index and length of each block found.
6.  If at least one block of 5s was found:
    *   Determine the starting index and length of the *first* block identified.
    *   In the output sequence, replace the elements from the starting index up to (starting index + length - 1) with the value `key1`.
7.  If at least two blocks of 5s were found:
    *   Determine the starting index and length of the *second* block identified.
    *   In the output sequence, replace the elements from the starting index up to (starting index + length - 1) with the value `key2`.
8.  Return the modified output sequence, ensuring it's in the same format (e.g., list or NumPy array) as the input sequence.
