    type: List[Tuple[int, int]] # List of (start_index, length)
    description: Contiguous blocks of the target_digit (5) within the input_sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of elements in the input sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of elements in the output sequence (always equals input length).

    property: order
    description: Blocks are processed based on their appearance order (first, second).

actions:

    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [key1, key2]
    description: Extract the first and second elements from the input_sequence.
  - name: identify_target_blocks
    inputs: [input_sequence, target_digit]
    outputs: [target_blocks]
    description: Find all contiguous sequences of the target_digit (5) in the input.
  - name: replace_first_block
    inputs: [input_sequence, target_blocks, key1]
    outputs: [modified_sequence]
    condition: target_blocks count >= 1
    description: Replace the elements of the first identified target_block with key1.
  - name: replace_second_block
    inputs: [modified_sequence, target_blocks, key2]
    outputs: [output_sequence]
    condition: target_blocks count >= 2
    description: Replace the elements of the second identified target_block with key2.
  - name: copy_unchanged
    inputs: [input_sequence, target_blocks]
    outputs: [output_sequence]
    description: Elements not part of the first or second target_block are copied directly from input to output at the same position.

relationships:
  - type: replacement
    subject: first target_block
    object: key1
    description: The first block of 5s is replaced by key1 repeated for the block's length.
  - type: replacement
    subject: second target_block
    object: key2
    description: The second block of 5s is replaced by key2 repeated for the block's length.
  - type: positional_invariance
    subject: non-target elements
    description: Digits other than the 5s in the identified blocks maintain their original position in the output.
