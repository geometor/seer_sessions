    description: The initial sequence of single-digit integers.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int] # Also representable as numpy.ndarray
    description: The resulting sequence after transformation, initialized as a copy of the input.
  - name: key1
    type: int
    description: The first integer in the input_sequence. Used as the replacement value for the first block of 5s.
  - name: key2
    type: int
    description: The second integer in the input_sequence. Used as the replacement value for the second block of 5s.
  - name: target_digit
    type: int
    value: 5
    description: The specific digit in the input_sequence whose contiguous blocks trigger replacement.
  - name: target_blocks
    type: List[Tuple[int, int]] # List of (start_index, length)
    description: A list identifying all contiguous blocks of the target_digit (5) found within the input_sequence, ordered by their starting position.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of elements in the input sequence. Assumed to be >= 2 based on examples.
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of elements in the output sequence, which is always equal to the input sequence length.
  - object: target_blocks
    property: count
    description: The number of contiguous blocks of the target_digit identified.
  - object: target_blocks
    property: order
    description: Blocks are processed sequentially based on their order of appearance in the input (first block, second block, etc.).

actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [output_sequence]
    description: Create the output sequence as an identical copy of the input sequence.
  - name: identify_keys
    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [key1, key2]
    description: Extract the first element as key1 and the second element as key2.
  - name: find_target_blocks
    inputs: [input_sequence, target_digit]
    outputs: [target_blocks]
    description: Scan the input sequence and identify the start index and length of all contiguous blocks composed solely of the target_digit (5).
  - name: replace_first_block
    inputs: [output_sequence, target_blocks, key1]
    outputs: [output_sequence] # Modifies output_sequence in place
    condition: target_blocks count >= 1
    description: Identify the first block from target_blocks. Replace the elements in the output_sequence corresponding to this block's start index and length with the value of key1.
  - name: replace_second_block
    inputs: [output_sequence, target_blocks, key2]
    outputs: [output_sequence] # Modifies output_sequence in place
    condition: target_blocks count >= 2
    description: Identify the second block from target_blocks. Replace the elements in the output_sequence corresponding to this block's start index and length with the value of key2.

relationships:
  - type: copy
    subject: input_sequence
    object: output_sequence
    description: The output sequence starts as a direct copy of the input sequence.
  - type: positional_mapping
    subject: key1
    object: first target_block
    description: The value of key1 (input[0]) replaces the values within the segment of the output_sequence defined by the first block of 5s.
  - type: positional_mapping
    subject: key2
    object: second target_block
    description: The value of key2 (input[1]) replaces the values within the segment of the output_sequence defined by the second block of 5s.
  - type: positional_invariance
    subject: non_target_block elements
    description: Elements in the input_sequence that are not part of the first or second block of 5s retain their original value and position in the output_sequence.
