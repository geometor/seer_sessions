"""
Transforms a sequence of integers by replacing contiguous blocks of '5's based on the first two numbers.

The transformation rule is as follows:
1.  Identify the first number (`key1`) and second number (`key2`) from the input sequence.
2.  Find all contiguous blocks (sequences) of the number 5 in the input sequence.
3.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input.
4.  If at least one block of 5s exists, replace the elements in the output sequence corresponding to the *first* identified block with `key1`.
5.  If at least two blocks of 5s exist, replace the elements in the output sequence corresponding to the *second* identified block with `key2`.
6.  All other numbers in the sequence remain unchanged in their positions.
