## Perception

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers into another sequence of the same length. The core transformation appears to target sequences of the digit '5'. The first two digits of the input sequence play a special role in determining the replacement values for these '5' sequences. Other digits, particularly '0', seem to remain unchanged in their positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Identify the first number in the input sequence as `key1`.
3.  Identify the second number in the input sequence as `key2`.
4.  Find all contiguous blocks (sequences) of the number 5 in the input sequence, noting their starting positions and lengths.
5.  If at least one block of 5s exists:
    *   Take the first identified block of 5s.
    *   Replace the elements in the output sequence corresponding to this block's position and length with the value `key1`.
6.  If at least two blocks of 5s exist:
    *   Take the second identified block of 5s.
    *   Replace the elements in the output sequence corresponding to this block's position and length with the value `key2`.
7.  Return the modified output sequence.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided execution results indicate that the previous code attempt failed consistently across all examples. The transformed output was identical to the input in every case, meaning the core logic intended to replace blocks of '5's with `key1` and `key2` did not execute correctly or had no effect on the output array.

The strategy will be:
1.  Verify the helper function `find_contiguous_blocks` correctly identifies the start indices and lengths of the '5' blocks using `tool_code`.
2.  Verify the core NumPy slice assignment mechanism works as intended in principle using `tool_code`.
3.  Assuming the block identification and assignment mechanisms are sound, the failure likely stems from an error in how these parts were integrated or potentially an issue in the execution environment running the code.
4.  Re-examine the natural language program and YAML facts to ensure they precisely capture the intended logic, paying close attention to the conditions and actions for replacement. Since the failed code didn't produce *incorrect* replacements but rather *no* replacements, the underlying logic described previously is likely correct, but its implementation failed. The refined description will re-affirm this logic clearly.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's verify the `find_contiguous_blocks` function and NumPy slice assignment.

            while i < n and sequence[i] == target_value:
                length += 1
                i += 1
            blocks.append((start_index, length))
        else:
            i += 1

```
**Metrics Analysis:**

1.  `find_contiguous_blocks` correctly identifies the blocks of '5's, returning their start index and length (e.g., `[(4, 3), (8, 3)]` for Example 1, `[(3, 2)]` for Example 3, `[]` for the no-block case).
2.  NumPy slice assignment (`output_sequence[start_index:end_index] = key`) works as expected in the simulation, correctly replacing the values within the specified slice with the key value.
3.  The simulation correctly produced the expected outputs for Examples 1 and 3 (`[9 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 7 7 7 0]` and `[2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`).
4.  The case with no blocks correctly resulted in no changes to the array.

Conclusion: The core logic and mechanisms (`find_contiguous_blocks` and NumPy slice assignment) are sound. The failure observed in the execution results must stem from an issue unrelated to this core logic, potentially in the execution environment or a subtle integration error not replicated in the direct simulation. The natural language program and facts should reiterate this confirmed logic.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Create a new sequence, `output_sequence`, as an identical copy of the `input_sequence`.
2.  Identify the value of the first element of the `input_sequence` as `key1`.
3.  Identify the value of the second element of the `input_sequence` as `key2`.
4.  Scan the `input_sequence` from beginning to end to find all contiguous blocks (uninterrupted sequences) consisting solely of the digit `5`. Record the starting index and length of each block found, maintaining the order in which they appear. Store these as `target_blocks`.
5.  Check if at least one block was found (i.e., if `target_blocks` is not empty). If yes:
    *   Select the first block recorded in `target_blocks`.
    *   Using its start index and length, replace the corresponding segment of elements in the `output_sequence` with the value `key1` repeated for the length of the block.
6.  Check if at least two blocks were found (i.e., if `target_blocks` contains two or more entries). If yes:
    *   Select the second block recorded in `target_blocks`.
    *   Using its start index and length, replace the corresponding segment of elements in the `output_sequence` with the value `key2` repeated for the length of the block.
7.  Return the modified `output_sequence`. (Elements not part of the first or second block of 5s remain unchanged from the initial copy).
