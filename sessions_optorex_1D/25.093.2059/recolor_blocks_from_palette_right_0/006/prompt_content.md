"""
Transforms a sequence of integers by replacing consecutive sequences of '5's.
The replacement value for the k-th sequence of '5's is determined by the k-th 
non-zero, non-5 number found in the original input sequence, maintaining order. 
Non-zero numbers (excluding 5), and zeros retain their original positions. 
Sequences of 5s for which there is no corresponding non-zero, non-5 number in 
the input remain unchanged.
