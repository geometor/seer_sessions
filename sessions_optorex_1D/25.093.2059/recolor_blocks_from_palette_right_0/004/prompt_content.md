"""
Transforms a sequence of integers by replacing consecutive sequences of '5's.
The replacement value for the k-th sequence of '5's is determined by the k-th 
non-zero number found in the original input sequence. Non-zero numbers 
(including the replacement values) and zeros retain their original positions 
unless they are part of a '5' sequence being replaced.
