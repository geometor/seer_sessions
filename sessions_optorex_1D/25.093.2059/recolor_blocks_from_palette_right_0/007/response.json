This pool is \nconstructed by extracting all non-zero, non-5 integers from the original input \nsequence, maintaining their relative order. The k-th sequence of '5's is \nreplaced by the k-th value from the replacement pool, repeated for the length \nof the sequence. If there are more sequences of '5's than available values \nin the replacement pool, the remaining sequences of '5's are left unchanged. \nAll other numbers (zeros and the original non-zero, non-5 numbers) retain \ntheir original positions in the output.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_replacement_pool(numbers):\n  \"\"\"\n  Extracts non-zero numbers, excluding 5, from a NumPy array, preserving order.\n\n  Args:\n    numbers: A NumPy array of integers.\n\n  Returns:\n    A list of non-zero, non-5 integers in their original order.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Filter out 0s and 5s, convert to list of standard Python ints\n  pool = [int(num) for num in numbers if num != 0 and num != 5]\n  return pool\n\ndef find_five_sequences(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies consecutive sequences of the number 5 in a NumPy array.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers: A NumPy array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a sequence\n        and contains 'start_index' (int) and 'length' (int).
