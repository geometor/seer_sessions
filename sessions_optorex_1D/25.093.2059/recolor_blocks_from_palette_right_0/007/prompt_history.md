Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Both input and output are sequences of integers, separated by spaces. All examples show sequences of length 12.
2.  **Key Values**: The integers `0` and `5` play special roles in the input.
    *   `0` seems to act as a separator or boundary and remains unchanged in the output at the same positions.
    *   `5` appears in consecutive sequences (e.g., `5 5`, `5 5 5`) and is always replaced in the output.
3.  **Other Numbers**: Non-zero numbers other than 5 appear at the beginning of the input sequence and also remain unchanged in the output *at their original positions*.
4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation involves replacing sequences of `5`s. The replacement value for each sequence of `5`s appears to be determined by the non-zero numbers present *earlier* in the input sequence. Specifically, the *k*-th sequence of `5`s (reading left-to-right) is replaced by repeating the *k*-th non-zero number found in the input sequence.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (in examples)
      - contains: integers, including special values 0 and 5
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - derived_from: input_sequence
  - name: zero_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: separator/boundary
      - transformation: remains unchanged
  - name: five_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - role: placeholder
      - occurs_in: sequences (e.g., [5, 5], [5, 5, 5])
      - transformation: replaced based on context
  - name: non_zero_values
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - source: input_sequence excluding 0 and 5
      - order: preserved from input sequence
      - role: replacement values for sequences of 5s
      - transformation: remain unchanged at their original positions

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: element-wise transformation based on value and context
  - type: preservation
    element: 0
    rule: input[i] == 0 implies output[i] == 0
  - type: preservation
    element: non_zero_values (excluding 5)
    rule: if input[i] is a non-zero value (not 5), then output[i] == input[i]
  - type: replacement
    element: sequences of 5s
    rule: the k-th sequence of 5s in the input is replaced by the k-th non_zero_value (excluding 5) from the input, repeated for the length of the sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: ordered list of non-zero integers (excluding 5)
  - name: identify_five_sequences
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of start/end indices for consecutive sequences of 5s
  - name: generate_output
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
      - ordered_non_zeros
      - five_sequences_indices
    output: output_sequence
    process: iterate through input, apply preservation rules for 0s and other non-zeros, apply replacement rule for 5s using the ordered_non_zeros list based on the sequence order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `non_zero_pool` to store the non-zero numbers from the input that will be used for replacements.
2.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
3.  Initialize a counter `five_sequence_count` to 0.
4.  Scan the input sequence once from left to right. For each number encountered, if it is not 0 and not 5, add it to the `non_zero_pool` list.
5.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right using an index `i`.
6.  Check the number `current_num` at `input_sequence[i]`:
    *   If `current_num` is 0, append 0 to the `output_sequence`.
    *   If `current_num` is a non-zero number other than 5, append `current_num` to the `output_sequence`.
    *   If `current_num` is 5:
        *   Check if this 5 is the start of a new sequence of 5s (i.e., `i` is 0 or `input_sequence[i-1]` is not 5).
        *   If it is the start of a new sequence:
            *   Increment `five_sequence_count`.
            *   Determine the replacement value by taking the element at index `five_sequence_count - 1` from the `non_zero_pool`.
            *   Append this replacement value to the `output_sequence`.
        *   If it is *not* the start of a new sequence (i.e., it's a continuation of a sequence of 5s):
            *   Determine the replacement value by taking the element at index `five_sequence_count - 1` from the `non_zero_pool` (using the same value as the start of this sequence).
            *   Append this replacement value to the `output_sequence`.
7.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, the `output_sequence` contains the transformed result. Convert it back to a space-separated string if necessary.
```python
"""
Transforms a sequence of integers based on specific rules:
1. Parses the input string into a list of integers.
2. Identifies all non-zero integers except for 5, preserving their order. These form the 'replacement pool'.
3. Initializes an output list as a copy of the input list.
4. Iterates through the input list:
    - If the current number is 5:
        - Determine if this is the start of a consecutive sequence of 5s.
        - If it's the start, advance to the next replacement value from the pool.
        - Replace the 5 in the output list with the current replacement value.
    - If the current number is not 5 (i.e., 0 or another non-5 number), it remains unchanged in the output list (already handled by the initial copy).
5. Converts the transformed list of integers back into a space-separated string.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt failed to produce the correct output for any of the training examples. The transformed output consistently matched the original input, indicating that the core replacement logic for the sequences of '5's was not being executed or was having no effect.

Tracing the provided Python code logic against the examples suggests the algorithm *should* work:
1.  Identify non-zero, non-5 numbers in order to form a `replacement_pool`.
2.  Identify consecutive sequences of '5's (start index and length).
3.  Iterate through the sequences and the pool simultaneously. For the *k*-th sequence and *k*-th pool number, replace the '5's in the sequence with the pool number.
4.  Leave other numbers (0s and the original non-zero, non-5 numbers) unchanged.

Given the discrepancy between the traced logic and the execution results, the issue likely lies in a subtle implementation bug within the provided Python code (perhaps related to array copying or slicing) or an issue in the execution environment where the tests were run.

The strategy remains to refine the description of the transformation rule based *purely on the input/output examples*, assuming the examples correctly demonstrate the desired transformation. The core logic identified previously still appears consistent across all examples.

**Metrics Analysis:**

Let's analyze each training example to confirm the pattern. We will identify the replacement pool (non-zero, non-5 numbers in order) and the sequences of 5s.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - structure: ordered sequence
      - elements: integers including 0 and 5
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - structure: ordered sequence, same length as input
      - derivation: transformed version of input_sequence
  - name: marker_value
    type: integer
    value: 5
    properties:
      - role: indicates positions to be replaced
      - occurrence: can appear in consecutive sequences (e.g., [5], [5, 5], [5, 5, 5])
  - name: zero_value
    type: integer
    value: 0
    properties:
      - role: separator or padding
      - transformation: preserved at its original position
  - name: replacement_pool
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - source: extracted from input_sequence
      - extraction_rule: all non-zero, non-5 integers from input, maintaining original relative order
      - role: provides values used to replace sequences of marker_value (5)
  - name: five_sequence
    type: concept
    properties:
      - description: a contiguous block of one or more '5's in the input_sequence
      - identification: ordered sequentially from left to right in the input_sequence
      - attributes: start_index, length

relationships:
  - type: preservation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: elements that are 0 or are members of the replacement_pool retain their value and position in the output_sequence, unless they are part of a five_sequence. (Correction: The pool members *do not* necessarily retain their position if they are replaced by the logic, only 0s and non-pool, non-5 numbers do. Rephrasing: Elements that are 0 retain their value and position. Non-zero, non-5 elements *also* retain their value and position).
  - type: replacement
    target: five_sequence
    rule: the k-th identified five_sequence in the input_sequence is replaced by the k-th value from the replacement_pool.
    details:
      - The replacement value is repeated to match the length of the five_sequence being replaced.
      - This replacement happens only if a corresponding k-th value exists in the replacement_pool.
      - If there are more five_sequences than values in the replacement_pool, the excess five_sequences remain unchanged (i.e., keep their '5' values).

actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence (initially a copy of input_sequence)
  - name: build_replacement_pool
    input: input_sequence
    output: ordered list of non-zero, non-5 integers (replacement_pool)
  - name: identify_five_sequences
    input: input_sequence
    output: ordered list of five_sequence details (start_index, length)
  - name: apply_replacements
    inputs:
      - output_sequence (initialized)
      - replacement_pool
      - five_sequences list
    output: modified output_sequence
    process:
      - Iterate from k = 0 up to min(len(five_sequences), len(replacement_pool)) - 1.
      - For each k:
        - Get the k-th five_sequence details (start, length).
        - Get the k-th replacement value from the replacement_pool.
        - Update the output_sequence by setting the slice output_sequence[start : start + length] to the replacement value.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Prepare**: Start with the input sequence of integers. Create an output sequence initially identical to the input sequence.
2.  **Identify Replacement Values**: Scan the original *input* sequence from left to right. Create an ordered list, called the `replacement_pool`, containing all numbers that are *not* 0 and *not* 5. Maintain their original relative order.
3.  **Identify Target Sequences**: Scan the original *input* sequence from left to right. Identify all contiguous sequences of one or more '5's. Record the starting position (index) and length of each sequence found. Keep these sequences in the order they appear in the input. Let's call this the `five_sequences` list.
4.  **Perform Replacements**: Iterate through the `five_sequences` list, using an index `k` starting from 0. For each sequence `five_sequences[k]`:
    *   Check if there is a corresponding replacement value at index `k` in the `replacement_pool` (i.e., check if `k` is less than the length of `replacement_pool`).
    *   **If** a corresponding replacement value exists:
        *   Get the value `replacement_value = replacement_pool[k]`.
        *   Get the `start_index` and `length` from `five_sequences[k]`.
        *   In the *output* sequence, replace the elements from `start_index` up to (but not including) `start_index + length` with the `replacement_value`. (The `replacement_value` should fill the entire slice).
    *   **If** no corresponding replacement value exists (because the pool is shorter than the list of sequences), make no changes to the output sequence for this `five_sequence` and stop performing replacements for any subsequent sequences.
5.  **Finalize**: The modified output sequence is the final result.
