Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Both input and output are sequences of integers, separated by spaces. All examples show sequences of length 12.
2.  **Key Values**: The integers `0` and `5` play special roles in the input.
    *   `0` seems to act as a separator or boundary and remains unchanged in the output at the same positions.
    *   `5` appears in consecutive sequences (e.g., `5 5`, `5 5 5`) and is always replaced in the output.
3.  **Other Numbers**: Non-zero numbers other than 5 appear at the beginning of the input sequence and also remain unchanged in the output *at their original positions*.
4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation involves replacing sequences of `5`s. The replacement value for each sequence of `5`s appears to be determined by the non-zero numbers present *earlier* in the input sequence. Specifically, the *k*-th sequence of `5`s (reading left-to-right) is replaced by repeating the *k*-th non-zero number found in the input sequence.

**YAML Facts:**

  - name: five_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 5

      - transformation: replaced based on context
  - name: non_zero_values
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - source: input_sequence excluding 0 and 5
      - order: preserved from input sequence
      - role: replacement values for sequences of 5s
      - transformation: remain unchanged at their original positions

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: element-wise transformation based on value and context
  - type: preservation
    element: 0
    rule: input[i] == 0 implies output[i] == 0
  - type: preservation
    element: non_zero_values (excluding 5)
    rule: if input[i] is a non-zero value (not 5), then output[i] == input[i]
  - type: replacement
    element: sequences of 5s
    rule: the k-th sequence of 5s in the input is replaced by the k-th non_zero_value (excluding 5) from the input, repeated for the length of the sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: ordered list of non-zero integers (excluding 5)
  - name: identify_five_sequences
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of start/end indices for consecutive sequences of 5s
  - name: generate_output
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
      - ordered_non_zeros
      - five_sequences_indices
    output: output_sequence
    process: iterate through input, apply preservation rules for 0s and other non-zeros, apply replacement rule for 5s using the ordered_non_zeros list based on the sequence order.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `non_zero_pool` to store the non-zero numbers from the input that will be used for replacements.
2.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
3.  Initialize a counter `five_sequence_count` to 0.
4.  Scan the input sequence once from left to right. For each number encountered, if it is not 0 and not 5, add it to the `non_zero_pool` list.
5.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right using an index `i`.
6.  Check the number `current_num` at `input_sequence[i]`:
    *   If `current_num` is 0, append 0 to the `output_sequence`.
    *   If `current_num` is a non-zero number other than 5, append `current_num` to the `output_sequence`.
    *   If `current_num` is 5:
        *   Check if this 5 is the start of a new sequence of 5s (i.e., `i` is 0 or `input_sequence[i-1]` is not 5).
        *   If it is the start of a new sequence:
            *   Increment `five_sequence_count`.
            *   Determine the replacement value by taking the element at index `five_sequence_count - 1` from the `non_zero_pool`.
            *   Append this replacement value to the `output_sequence`.
        *   If it is *not* the start of a new sequence (i.e., it's a continuation of a sequence of 5s):
            *   Determine the replacement value by taking the element at index `five_sequence_count - 1` from the `non_zero_pool` (using the same value as the start of this sequence).
            *   Append this replacement value to the `output_sequence`.
7.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, the `output_sequence` contains the transformed result. Convert it back to a space-separated string if necessary.
