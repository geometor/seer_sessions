            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for these examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure**: Both input and output are sequences of integers, separated by spaces. All examples show sequences of length 12.\n2.  **Key Values**: The integers `0` and `5` play special roles in the input.\n    *   `0` seems to act as a separator or boundary and remains unchanged in the output at the same positions.\n    *   `5` appears in consecutive sequences (e.g., `5 5`, `5 5 5`) and is always replaced in the output.\n3.  **Other Numbers**: Non-zero numbers other than 5 appear at the beginning of the input sequence and also remain unchanged in the output *at their original positions*.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern**: The core transformation involves replacing sequences of `5`s. The replacement value for each sequence of `5`s appears to be determined by the non-zero numbers present *earlier* in the input sequence. Specifically, the *k*-th sequence of `5`s (reading left-to-right) is replaced by repeating the *k*-th non-zero number found in the input sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
