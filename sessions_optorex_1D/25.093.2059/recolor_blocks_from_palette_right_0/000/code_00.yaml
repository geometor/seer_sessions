objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (in examples)
      - contains: integers, including special values 0 and 5
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - derived_from: input_sequence
  - name: zero_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: separator/boundary
      - transformation: remains unchanged
  - name: five_value
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 5
      - role: placeholder
      - occurs_in: sequences (e.g., [5, 5], [5, 5, 5])
      - transformation: replaced based on context
  - name: non_zero_values
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - source: input_sequence excluding 0 and 5
      - order: preserved from input sequence
      - role: replacement values for sequences of 5s
      - transformation: remain unchanged at their original positions

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: element-wise transformation based on value and context
  - type: preservation
    element: 0
    rule: input[i] == 0 implies output[i] == 0
  - type: preservation
    element: non_zero_values (excluding 5)
    rule: if input[i] is a non-zero value (not 5), then output[i] == input[i]
  - type: replacement
    element: sequences of 5s
    rule: the k-th sequence of 5s in the input is replaced by the k-th non_zero_value (excluding 5) from the input, repeated for the length of the sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: ordered list of non-zero integers (excluding 5)
  - name: identify_five_sequences
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of start/end indices for consecutive sequences of 5s
  - name: generate_output
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
      - ordered_non_zeros
      - five_sequences_indices
    output: output_sequence
    process: iterate through input, apply preservation rules for 0s and other non-zeros, apply replacement rule for 5s using the ordered_non_zeros list based on the sequence order.
