            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` occurring in all examples strongly suggests that the `transform` function is receiving the input data as a NumPy array where boolean comparisons are being performed element-wise, resulting in a boolean array instead of a single boolean value required by constructs like `if`. This typically happens if the input `input_grid` is treated as a whole array in a comparison (e.g., `if input_grid == 5:`), or if the iteration logic incorrectly handles multi-dimensional arrays.\n\nGiven the code structure, the most likely cause is that the input `input_grid` provided by the testing environment is a 2D NumPy array (e.g., representing a grid with a single row), and the processing logic (specifically the `if element == 5:` check inside the loop) fails when `element` itself becomes an array (if `list(input_grid)` creates a list of arrays).\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the start of the `transform` function to explicitly handle the case where `input_grid` is a 2D NumPy array. If it has only one row, extract that row as the 1D sequence to be processed. If it has multiple rows, clarify if the operation applies row-wise or only to the first row (based on the examples, it seems to operate on a single sequence, likely the first row). Assume for now it's always a single row passed as a 2D array.\n2.  **Core Logic Validation:** The core transformation logic (finding the key sequence, iterating, replacing blocks of 5s using the key sequence) appears correct based on the initial examples and should be retained.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the input format (likely a 1-row grid) and the row-based processing.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nNo `tool_code` execution is needed here. The error message is consistent across all examples and points directly to a type mismatch or improper handling of NumPy array comparisons within conditional statements. The analysis indicates the input is likely a 2D array (1xN) being processed incorrectly.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

If the input is empty or invalid, handle appropriately (e.g., return an empty structure matching the input type).\n3.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.\n4.  Scan the `processing_sequence` from the beginning to identify the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers before the first `0`. Store this sequence as `key_sequence`.\n5.  Initialize a variable `key_index` to `0`. This index will track which element of the `key_sequence` to use for replacement.\n6.
