**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` occurring in all examples strongly suggests that the `transform` function is receiving the input data as a NumPy array where boolean comparisons are being performed element-wise, resulting in a boolean array instead of a single boolean value required by constructs like `if`. This typically happens if the input `input_grid` is treated as a whole array in a comparison (e.g., `if input_grid == 5:`), or if the iteration logic incorrectly handles multi-dimensional arrays.

Given the code structure, the most likely cause is that the input `input_grid` provided by the testing environment is a 2D NumPy array (e.g., representing a grid with a single row), and the processing logic (specifically the `if element == 5:` check inside the loop) fails when `element` itself becomes an array (if `list(input_grid)` creates a list of arrays).

**Strategy:**
1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the start of the `transform` function to explicitly handle the case where `input_grid` is a 2D NumPy array. If it has only one row, extract that row as the 1D sequence to be processed. If it has multiple rows, clarify if the operation applies row-wise or only to the first row (based on the examples, it seems to operate on a single sequence, likely the first row). Assume for now it's always a single row passed as a 2D array.
2.  **Core Logic Validation:** The core transformation logic (finding the key sequence, iterating, replacing blocks of 5s using the key sequence) appears correct based on the initial examples and should be retained.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the input format (likely a 1-row grid) and the row-based processing.

**Metrics Gathering**

No `tool_code` execution is needed here. The error message is consistent across all examples and points directly to a type mismatch or improper handling of NumPy array comparisons within conditional statements. The analysis indicates the input is likely a 2D array (1xN) being processed incorrectly.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the `input_grid` (a 2D NumPy array, typically 1xN).
2.  Extract the first row of the `input_grid` as a 1D list called `processing_sequence`. If the input is empty or invalid, handle appropriately (e.g., return an empty structure matching the input type).
3.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
4.  Scan the `processing_sequence` from the beginning to identify the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers before the first `0`. Store this sequence as `key_sequence`.
5.  Initialize a variable `key_index` to `0`. This index will track which element of the `key_sequence` to use for replacement.
6.  Iterate through the `processing_sequence` from the first element to the last, keeping track of the current index `i` and element `current_element`.
7.  For each `current_element`:
    a.  If `current_element` is `5`:
        i.  Determine the replacement value: Use `key_sequence[key_index]` if `key_index` is within the bounds of `key_sequence`. Handle the edge case where there might be more blocks of 5s than keys (e.g., reuse the last key or default to 5 if `key_sequence` is empty).
        ii. Append the determined replacement value to the `output_sequence`.
        iii. Check if this `5` is the last element in its contiguous block (i.e., if it's the last element of `processing_sequence` or the next element is not `5`).
        iv. If it is the end of a block of 5s, increment `key_index` by 1.
    b.  If `current_element` is not `5`:
        i.  Append `current_element` directly to the `output_sequence`.
8.  After iterating through all elements, convert the `output_sequence` list into a NumPy array.
9.  Reshape this array to match the original dimensions (shape) of the `input_grid`.
10. Return the final reshaped NumPy array (`output_grid`).
