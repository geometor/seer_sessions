objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: numpy.ndarray # Updated: Likely a 2D NumPy array (often 1xN)
    description: A 2D NumPy array representing the input, typically with a single row containing the sequence of integers.
  - name: processing_sequence
    type: list[int] # Extracted 1D sequence
    description: The first row extracted from the input_grid, used for the transformation logic.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list[int] # Intermediate result before potential reshaping
    description: A 1D list of integers generated by applying the transformation rule to the processing_sequence.
  - name: output_grid
    type: numpy.ndarray # Final output matching input format
    description: A 2D NumPy array (matching input_grid dimensions) containing the transformed sequence.
  - name: key_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: The sequence of initial non-zero integers found at the beginning of the processing_sequence before the first zero.
  - name: placeholder_value
    type: int
    value: 5
    description: The integer in the processing_sequence that gets replaced.
  - name: separator_value
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: The integer that acts as a separator and remains unchanged.
  - name: block_of_placeholders
    type: list[int] # Concept within the processing_sequence
    description: A contiguous sequence of placeholder_value (5) in the processing_sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_grid
    property: shape
    description: Often (1, N), indicating one row and N columns.
  - object: processing_sequence
    property: elements
    description: Contains integers, including key_sequence numbers, placeholder_value (5), and separator_value (0).
  - object: output_grid
    property: shape
    description: Matches the shape of input_grid.
  - object: key_sequence
    property: order
    description: The order of numbers in this sequence determines the replacement value for successive blocks_of_placeholders in the processing_sequence.

actions:
  - name: extract_processing_sequence
    input: input_grid
    output: processing_sequence
    description: Extract the first row from the input_grid as a 1D list of integers. Handle potential errors if the grid is empty or has unexpected dimensions.
  - name: identify_key_sequence
    input: processing_sequence
    output: key_sequence
    description: Extract the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers from the start of the processing_sequence.
  - name: iterate_and_replace
    input: [processing_sequence, key_sequence]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Process the processing_sequence element by element. If an element is the placeholder_value (5), replace it with the appropriate number from the key_sequence based on which block_of_placeholders it belongs to. Otherwise, keep the element unchanged. Maintain an index for the key_sequence, incrementing it after each block of 5s.
  - name: reshape_output
    input: [output_sequence, input_grid]
    output: output_grid
    description: Convert the 1D output_sequence back into a 2D NumPy array with the same shape as the original input_grid.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: n-th block_of_placeholders in processing_sequence
    to: n-th element in key_sequence
    description: Each block of 5s in the processing_sequence is replaced by replicating the corresponding element from the key_sequence.
  - type: preservation
    elements: [separator_value (0), initial key_sequence numbers in processing_sequence]
    description: Elements in the processing_sequence that are not the placeholder_value (5) generally retain their value and position in the output_sequence.
