"""
Processes a sequence of integers (provided as a list or NumPy array).
It identifies an initial sequence of non-zero numbers (the 'key sequence') 
occurring before the first zero in the input sequence.
It then iterates through the input sequence. Numbers other than '5' are kept as is.
Each contiguous block of '5's encountered after the initial key sequence (or after the first zero)
is replaced by repeating the corresponding number from the key sequence.
The first block of '5's uses the first number from the key sequence, the second block 
uses the second number, and so on. The '0's act as separators and remain unchanged.
The output sequence has the same length and type as the input sequence.
