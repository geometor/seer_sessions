Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Numbers:**
    *   The number `0` appears frequently and seems to retain its position in the output. It often acts as a separator.
    *   The number `5` appears in contiguous blocks in the input and is always replaced in the output.
    *   The initial non-zero numbers at the start of the input sequence seem significant.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves replacing blocks of `5`s. The replacement value for each block appears to be drawn from the initial non-zero numbers.
4.  **Mapping:**
    *   In `train_1` (Input: `6 3 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0`), the first block `5 5 5` becomes `6 6 6`, and the second block `5 5 5` becomes `3 3 3`. The replacement values `6` and `3` are the first two non-zero numbers in the input.
    *   In `train_4` (Input: `3 6 9 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5`), the initial non-zero numbers are `3, 6, 9`. The first `5 5` block becomes `3 3`, the second `5 5` block becomes `6 6`, and the third `5 5` block becomes `9 9`.
    *   This pattern holds consistently across all examples. The *n*-th block of `5`s is replaced by the *n*-th non-zero number found at the beginning of the input sequence.
5.  **Boundary Conditions:** The initial non-zero numbers themselves, and the `0`s, are unchanged in the output. The replacement applies only to the number `5`.

**YAML Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
2.  Scan the `input_sequence` from the beginning to identify the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers before the first `0`. Store this sequence as `key_sequence`.
3.  Initialize a variable `key_index` to `0`. This index will track which element of the `key_sequence` to use for replacement.
4.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` from the first element to the last, keeping track of the current index `i`.
5.  For each element `current_element` at index `i`:
    a.  If `current_element` is `5`:
        i.  Append the element `key_sequence[key_index]` to the `output_sequence`.
        ii. Check if the next element (at index `i+1`) exists and is *not* `5`, or if this is the last element of the `input_sequence`.
        iii. If either condition in step (ii) is true (meaning the current block of 5s is ending), increment `key_index` by 1.
    b.  If `current_element` is not `5`:
        i.  Append `current_element` directly to the `output_sequence`.
6.  After iterating through all elements, return the completed `output_sequence`.
