## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial code successfully processed 7 out of the 8 examples (6 training, 1 test). The single failure occurred in `train_2`, indicating a flaw in the logic likely related to edge cases or a misinterpretation of the rule's scope.

**Analysis of Failure (`train_2`):**

*   **Input:** `1 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5`
*   **Expected:** `1 5 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 5 5 5`
*   **Actual:** `1 1 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5`

The key difference is how the number `5` is treated *before* the first zero versus *after*. The expected output retains the `5` at index 1 (part of the initial segment `1 5`) but replaces the block of `5`s starting at index 5. The actual output incorrectly replaced the `5` at index 1. It also appears to have used the second key (`5`) for the first block of `5`s after the zero, instead of the first key (`1`).

**Revised Hypothesis:**

The transformation rule applies differently based on position relative to the first `0` in the sequence:
1.  Identify the "key sequence": the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers *before* the first `0`.
2.  Elements *up to and including* the first `0` remain unchanged in the output.
3.  Elements *after* the first `0` are processed:
    *   Non-`5` elements are copied directly.
    *   Contiguous blocks of `5`s are replaced by replicating the corresponding number from the `key_sequence`. The *n*-th block of `5`s encountered *after* the first `0` is replaced using the *n*-th number from the `key_sequence`.

**Strategy:**

1.  Refine the natural language program to explicitly state that replacement only occurs *after* the first zero.
2.  Update the YAML facts to reflect this positional conditionality.
3.  The coder phase will then need to modify the implementation to partition the processing based on the location of the first zero.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
2.  Scan the `input_sequence` to find the index of the first occurrence of the `separator_value` (0). If no `0` is found, treat the entire sequence as the `initial_segment`.
3.  Define the `initial_segment` as the portion of the `input_sequence` from the start up to and including the first `0` (or the whole sequence if no `0`).
4.  Define the `subsequent_segment` as the portion of the `input_sequence` following the `initial_segment`.
5.  Extract the `key_sequence` by taking all non-zero numbers from the start of the `input_sequence` *before* the index of the first `0`.
6.  Append all elements from the `initial_segment` directly to the `output_sequence`.
7.  Initialize a variable `key_index` to `0`. This index will track which element of the `key_sequence` to use for replacing `placeholder_value` (5) in the `subsequent_segment`.
8.  Iterate through the `subsequent_segment` from its first element to its last, keeping track of the current index `j` relative to the start of the `subsequent_segment`.
9.  For each element `current_element` at index `j` in the `subsequent_segment`:
    a.  If `current_element` is the `placeholder_value` (5):
        i.  Determine the replacement value: Use `key_sequence[key_index]` if `key_index` is within the bounds of `key_sequence`; otherwise, handle the edge case (e.g., use the last key or the original value 5, assuming valid inputs per examples likely means `key_index` won't exceed length). Append this replacement value to `output_sequence`.
        ii. Check if this is the end of a block of `5`s within the `subsequent_segment`: Look ahead to the next element (at index `j+1`). If the next element does not exist or is not `5`, then the block ends here.
        iii. If the block of `5`s ends (as determined in step ii), increment `key_index` by 1.
    b.  If `current_element` is not `5`:
        i.  Append `current_element` directly to the `output_sequence`.
10. After iterating through all elements of the `subsequent_segment`, return the completed `output_sequence`.
