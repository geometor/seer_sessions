            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe initial code successfully processed 7 out of the 8 examples (6 training, 1 test). The single failure occurred in `train_2`, indicating a flaw in the logic likely related to edge cases or a misinterpretation of the rule's scope.\n\n**Analysis of Failure (`train_2`):**\n\n*   **Input:** `1 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5`\n*   **Expected:** `1 5 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 5 5 5`\n*   **Actual:** `1 1 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5`\n\nThe key difference is how the number `5` is treated *before* the first zero versus *after*. The expected output retains the `5` at index 1 (part of the initial segment `1 5`) but replaces the block of `5`s starting at index 5. The actual output incorrectly replaced the `5` at index 1. It also appears to have used the second key (`5`) for the first block of `5`s after the zero, instead of the first key (`1`).\n\n**Revised Hypothesis:**\n\nThe transformation rule applies differently based on position relative to the first `0` in the sequence:\n1.  Identify the \"key sequence\": the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers *before* the first `0`.\n2.  Elements *up to and including* the first `0` remain unchanged in the output.\n3.  Elements *after* the first `0` are processed:\n    *   Non-`5` elements are copied directly.\n    *   Contiguous blocks of `5`s are replaced by replicating the corresponding number from the `key_sequence`. The *n*-th block of `5`s encountered *after* the first `0` is replaced using the *n*-th number from the `key_sequence`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Refine the natural language program to explicitly state that replacement only occurs *after* the first zero.\n2.  Update the YAML facts to reflect this positional conditionality.\n3.  The coder phase will then need to modify the implementation to partition the processing based on the location of the first zero.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the provided execution results:\n\n*   **Total Examples:** 8 (7 train, 1 test)\n*   **Correct Examples:** 7\n*   **Incorrect Examples:** 1 (`train_2`)\n*   **Success Rate:** 87.5%\n*   **Total Pixels Off (Sum across all examples):** 4 (all from `train_2`)\n*   **Average Pixels Off per Example:** 0.5\n\n"

Scan the `input_sequence` to find the index of the first occurrence of the `separator_value` (0). If no `0` is found, treat the entire sequence as the `initial_segment`.\n3.  Define the `initial_segment` as the portion of the `input_sequence` from the start up to and including the first `0` (or the whole sequence if no `0`).\n4.  Define the `subsequent_segment` as the portion of the `input_sequence` following the `initial_segment`.\n5.  Extract the `key_sequence` by taking all non-zero numbers from the start of the `input_sequence` *before* the index of the first `0`.\n6.  Append all elements from the `initial_segment` directly to the `output_sequence`.\n7.  Initialize a variable `key_index` to `0`.

Append this replacement value to `output_sequence`.\n        ii. Check if this is the end of a block of `5`s within the `subsequent_segment`: Look ahead to the next element (at index `j+1`).
