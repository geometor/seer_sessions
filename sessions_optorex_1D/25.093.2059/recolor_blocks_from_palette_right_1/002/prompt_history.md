Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Numbers:**
    *   The number `0` appears frequently and seems to retain its position in the output. It often acts as a separator.
    *   The number `5` appears in contiguous blocks in the input and is always replaced in the output.
    *   The initial non-zero numbers at the start of the input sequence seem significant.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves replacing blocks of `5`s. The replacement value for each block appears to be drawn from the initial non-zero numbers.
4.  **Mapping:**
    *   In `train_1` (Input: `6 3 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0`), the first block `5 5 5` becomes `6 6 6`, and the second block `5 5 5` becomes `3 3 3`. The replacement values `6` and `3` are the first two non-zero numbers in the input.
    *   In `train_4` (Input: `3 6 9 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5`), the initial non-zero numbers are `3, 6, 9`. The first `5 5` block becomes `3 3`, the second `5 5` block becomes `6 6`, and the third `5 5` block becomes `9 9`.
    *   This pattern holds consistently across all examples. The *n*-th block of `5`s is replaced by the *n*-th non-zero number found at the beginning of the input sequence.
5.  **Boundary Conditions:** The initial non-zero numbers themselves, and the `0`s, are unchanged in the output. The replacement applies only to the number `5`.

**YAML Facts:**

properties:

  - object: key_sequence
    property: order
    description: The order of numbers in this sequence determines the replacement value for successive blocks_of_placeholders.

actions:
  - name: identify_key_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    output: key_sequence
    description: Extract the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers from the start of the input_sequence.
  - name: iterate_and_replace
    input: [input_sequence, key_sequence]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Process the input_sequence element by element. If an element is the placeholder_value (5), replace it with the appropriate number from the key_sequence based on which block_of_placeholders it belongs to. Otherwise, keep the element unchanged.
  - name: advance_key_index
    trigger: End of a block_of_placeholders
    description: Move to the next number in the key_sequence when transitioning from one block_of_placeholders to the next.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: n-th block_of_placeholders in input_sequence
    to: n-th element in key_sequence
    description: Each block of 5s in the input is replaced by replicating the corresponding element from the key_sequence.
  - type: preservation
    elements: [separator_value (0), initial key_sequence numbers]
    description: Elements that are not the placeholder_value (5) generally retain their value and position in the output_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
2.  Scan the `input_sequence` from the beginning to identify the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers before the first `0`. Store this sequence as `key_sequence`.
3.  Initialize a variable `key_index` to `0`. This index will track which element of the `key_sequence` to use for replacement.
4.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` from the first element to the last, keeping track of the current index `i`.
5.  For each element `current_element` at index `i`:
    a.  If `current_element` is `5`:
        i.  Append the element `key_sequence[key_index]` to the `output_sequence`.
        ii. Check if the next element (at index `i+1`) exists and is *not* `5`, or if this is the last element of the `input_sequence`.
        iii. If either condition in step (ii) is true (meaning the current block of 5s is ending), increment `key_index` by 1.
    b.  If `current_element` is not `5`:
        i.  Append `current_element` directly to the `output_sequence`.
6.  After iterating through all elements, return the completed `output_sequence`.
```python
import re
from typing import List

"""
Processes a sequence of integers represented as a space-separated string.
It identifies an initial sequence of non-zero numbers (key sequence) before the first zero.
It then iterates through the input sequence. Numbers other than '5' are kept as is.
Each contiguous block of '5's is replaced by repeating the corresponding number from the key sequence.
The first block of '5's uses the first number from the key sequence, the second block uses the second number, and so on.
The '0's act as separators and remain unchanged.
