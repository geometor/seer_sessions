            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe execution errors (`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`) clearly indicate that the `transform` function was expecting string input but received NumPy arrays instead. The core transformation logic, which involves identifying an initial \"key\" sequence of non-zero numbers and using them to replace subsequent blocks of the number `5`, appears sound based on the visual inspection of the examples. The strategy is to modify the input handling and output formatting to work directly with numerical sequences (like lists or NumPy arrays) instead of strings, while preserving the core replacement algorithm.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe code failed during input processing, so no output was generated for comparison. We will re-examine the examples to confirm the pattern and gather structural data.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[6 3 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0]`, Output `[6 3 0 0 6 6 6 0 3 3 3 0]`. Keys: `[6, 3]`. Block 1 (`5 5 5`) -> `6 6 6`. Block 2 (`5 5 5`) -> `3 3 3`. Length: 12.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[1 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5]`, Output `[1 5 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 5 5 5]`. Keys: `[1, 5]`. Block 1 (`5 5 5`) -> `1 1 1`. Block 2 (`5 5 5`) -> `5 5 5`. Length: 12.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[8 9 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0]`, Output `[8 9 0 8 8 0 0 0 9 9 0 0]`. Keys: `[8, 9]`. Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `8 8`. Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `9 9`. Length: 12.\n*   **Example 4:** Input `[3 6 9 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5]`, Output `[3 6 9 3 3 0 0 6 6 0 9 9]`. Keys: `[3, 6, 9]`. Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `3 3`. Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `6 6`. Block 3 (`5 5`) -> `9 9`. Length: 12.\n*   **Example 5:** Input `[8 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0]`, Output `[8 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 1 1 1 0]`. Keys: `[8, 1]`. Block 1 (`5 5 5`) -> `8 8 8`. Block 2 (`5 5 5`) -> `1 1 1`. Length: 12.\n*   **Example 6:** Input `[2 8 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0]`, Output `[2 8 0 0 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 0]`. Keys: `[2, 8]`. Block 1 (`5 5 5`) -> `2 2 2`. Block 2 (`5 5 5`) -> `8 8 8`. Length: 12.\n*   **Example 7:** Input `[2 1 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0]`, Output `[2 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0]`. Keys: `[2, 1]`. Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `2 2`. Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `1 1`. Length: 12.\n\nObservations from metrics:\n*   All inputs/outputs have the same length (12 in these examples).\n*   The number `0` consistently acts as a separator and is preserved.\n*   The initial non-zero sequence (before the first `0`) determines the replacement values.\n*   The number `5` is the placeholder to be replaced.\n*   The *n*-th contiguous block of `5`s is replaced by the *n*-th number from the key sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence` to store the results.\n3.  Scan the `input_sequence` from the beginning to identify the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers before the first `0`. Store this sequence as `key_sequence`.\n4.  Initialize a variable `key_index` to `0`. This index tracks which element of the `key_sequence` to use for replacement.\n5.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` element by element, using an index `i` from 0 to `length(input_sequence) - 1`.\n6.  For each `current_element = input_sequence[i]`:\n    a.  If `current_element` is the placeholder value `5`:\n        i.  Determine the replacement value: If `key_index` is within the bounds of `key_sequence`, use `key_sequence[key_index]`; otherwise (if there are more blocks of 5s than keys), reuse the last key `key_sequence[-1]` if `key_sequence` is not empty, otherwise keep the original `5`.\n        ii. Append the determined replacement value to `output_sequence`.\n        iii. Check if this is the end of the current block of 5s. This occurs if it's the last element of `input_sequence` (`i == length(input_sequence) - 1`) or if the next element `input_sequence[i+1]` is not `5`.\n        iv. If it is the end of the block (condition in step iii is true), increment `key_index` by 1 to prepare for the next block.\n    b.  If `current_element` is not `5`:\n        i.  Append `current_element` directly to the `output_sequence`.\n7.  After iterating through all elements, return the completed `output_sequence`. Ensure the output is in the same format (e.g., list or NumPy array) as expected by the execution environment."
