Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Numbers:**
    *   The number `0` appears frequently and seems to retain its position in the output. It often acts as a separator.
    *   The number `5` appears in contiguous blocks in the input and is always replaced in the output.
    *   The initial non-zero numbers at the start of the input sequence seem significant.
3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves replacing blocks of `5`s. The replacement value for each block appears to be drawn from the initial non-zero numbers.
4.  **Mapping:**
    *   In `train_1` (Input: `6 3 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0`), the first block `5 5 5` becomes `6 6 6`, and the second block `5 5 5` becomes `3 3 3`. The replacement values `6` and `3` are the first two non-zero numbers in the input.
    *   In `train_4` (Input: `3 6 9 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5`), the initial non-zero numbers are `3, 6, 9`. The first `5 5` block becomes `3 3`, the second `5 5` block becomes `6 6`, and the third `5 5` block becomes `9 9`.
    *   This pattern holds consistently across all examples. The *n*-th block of `5`s is replaced by the *n*-th non-zero number found at the beginning of the input sequence.
5.  **Boundary Conditions:** The initial non-zero numbers themselves, and the `0`s, are unchanged in the output. The replacement applies only to the number `5`.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml

  - name: input_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: A sequence of integers provided as input.

    description: A sequence of integers generated as output.
  - name: key_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: The sequence of initial non-zero integers found at the beginning of the input_sequence before the first zero.
  - name: placeholder_value
    type: int
    value: 5
    description: The integer in the input sequence that gets replaced.
  - name: separator_value
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: The integer that acts as a separator and remains unchanged.
  - name: block_of_placeholders
    type: list[int]
    description: A contiguous sequence of placeholder_value (5) in the input_sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: elements
    description: Contains integers, including key_sequence numbers, placeholder_value (5), and separator_value (0).
  - object: output_sequence
    property: elements
    description: Contains integers, where blocks of placeholder_value are replaced by corresponding key_sequence numbers.
  - object: key_sequence
    property: order
    description: The order of numbers in this sequence determines the replacement value for successive blocks_of_placeholders.

actions:
  - name: identify_key_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    output: key_sequence
    description: Extract the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers from the start of the input_sequence.
  - name: iterate_and_replace
    input: [input_sequence, key_sequence]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Process the input_sequence element by element. If an element is the placeholder_value (5), replace it with the appropriate number from the key_sequence based on which block_of_placeholders it belongs to. Otherwise, keep the element unchanged.
  - name: advance_key_index
    trigger: End of a block_of_placeholders
    description: Move to the next number in the key_sequence when transitioning from one block_of_placeholders to the next.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: n-th block_of_placeholders in input_sequence
    to: n-th element in key_sequence
    description: Each block of 5s in the input is replaced by replicating the corresponding element from the key_sequence.
  - type: preservation
    elements: [separator_value (0), initial key_sequence numbers]
    description: Elements that are not the placeholder_value (5) generally retain their value and position in the output_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
2.  Scan the `input_sequence` from the beginning to identify the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers before the first `0`. Store this sequence as `key_sequence`.
3.  Initialize a variable `key_index` to `0`. This index will track which element of the `key_sequence` to use for replacement.
4.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` from the first element to the last, keeping track of the current index `i`.
5.  For each element `current_element` at index `i`:
    a.  If `current_element` is `5`:
        i.  Append the element `key_sequence[key_index]` to the `output_sequence`.
        ii. Check if the next element (at index `i+1`) exists and is *not* `5`, or if this is the last element of the `input_sequence`.
        iii. If either condition in step (ii) is true (meaning the current block of 5s is ending), increment `key_index` by 1.
    b.  If `current_element` is not `5`:
        i.  Append `current_element` directly to the `output_sequence`.
6.  After iterating through all elements, return the completed `output_sequence`.
