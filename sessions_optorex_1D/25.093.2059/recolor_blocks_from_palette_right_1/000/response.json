            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers.\n2.  **Key Numbers:**\n    *   The number `0` appears frequently and seems to retain its position in the output. It often acts as a separator.\n    *   The number `5` appears in contiguous blocks in the input and is always replaced in the output.\n    *   The initial non-zero numbers at the start of the input sequence seem significant.\n3.  **Transformation Pattern:** The core transformation involves replacing blocks of `5`s. The replacement value for each block appears to be drawn from the initial non-zero numbers.\n4.  **Mapping:**\n    *   In `train_1` (Input: `6 3 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0`), the first block `5 5 5` becomes `6 6 6`, and the second block `5 5 5` becomes `3 3 3`. The replacement values `6` and `3` are the first two non-zero numbers in the input.\n    *   In `train_4` (Input: `3 6 9 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5`), the initial non-zero numbers are `3, 6, 9`. The first `5 5` block becomes `3 3`, the second `5 5` block becomes `6 6`, and the third `5 5` block becomes `9 9`.\n    *   This pattern holds consistently across all examples. The *n*-th block of `5`s is replaced by the *n*-th non-zero number found at the beginning of the input sequence.\n5.  **Boundary Conditions:** The initial non-zero numbers themselves, and the `0`s, are unchanged in the output. The replacement applies only to the number `5`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
