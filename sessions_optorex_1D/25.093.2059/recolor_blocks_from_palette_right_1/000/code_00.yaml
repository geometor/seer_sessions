objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: A sequence of integers provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: A sequence of integers generated as output.
  - name: key_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: The sequence of initial non-zero integers found at the beginning of the input_sequence before the first zero.
  - name: placeholder_value
    type: int
    value: 5
    description: The integer in the input sequence that gets replaced.
  - name: separator_value
    type: int
    value: 0
    description: The integer that acts as a separator and remains unchanged.
  - name: block_of_placeholders
    type: list[int]
    description: A contiguous sequence of placeholder_value (5) in the input_sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: elements
    description: Contains integers, including key_sequence numbers, placeholder_value (5), and separator_value (0).
  - object: output_sequence
    property: elements
    description: Contains integers, where blocks of placeholder_value are replaced by corresponding key_sequence numbers.
  - object: key_sequence
    property: order
    description: The order of numbers in this sequence determines the replacement value for successive blocks_of_placeholders.

actions:
  - name: identify_key_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    output: key_sequence
    description: Extract the initial contiguous sequence of non-zero integers from the start of the input_sequence.
  - name: iterate_and_replace
    input: [input_sequence, key_sequence]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Process the input_sequence element by element. If an element is the placeholder_value (5), replace it with the appropriate number from the key_sequence based on which block_of_placeholders it belongs to. Otherwise, keep the element unchanged.
  - name: advance_key_index
    trigger: End of a block_of_placeholders
    description: Move to the next number in the key_sequence when transitioning from one block_of_placeholders to the next.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: n-th block_of_placeholders in input_sequence
    to: n-th element in key_sequence
    description: Each block of 5s in the input is replaced by replicating the corresponding element from the key_sequence.
  - type: preservation
    elements: [separator_value (0), initial key_sequence numbers]
    description: Elements that are not the placeholder_value (5) generally retain their value and position in the output_sequence.
