```python
"""
Processes a 2D NumPy array representing a grid, typically with a single row.
It identifies the segment before the first zero and extracts non-zero numbers 
from it to form a 'key sequence'. 
The part of the input sequence up to and including the first zero is copied 
directly to the output.
The part of the sequence *after* the first zero is then processed: numbers 
other than '5' are kept as is, while contiguous blocks of '5's are replaced 
by repeating the corresponding number from the key sequence. The first block 
of '5's uses the first number from the key sequence, the second block uses 
the second number, and so on. '0's act as separators and remain unchanged 
wherever they appear.
The output grid has the same shape and data type as the input grid.
