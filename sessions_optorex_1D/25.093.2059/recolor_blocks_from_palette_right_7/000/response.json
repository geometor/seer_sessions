Occurrences of '5' are replaced by other digits.\n    *   Other non-zero digits (besides '5') seem to serve as \"source\" values for the replacement.\n    *   Consecutive sequences (blocks) of '5's in the input are replaced entirely by repeating a single digit from the source values.\n    *   The source values used for replacement appear to be the non-zero digits from the input, excluding the '5's that are part of the replaceable blocks, taken in the order they appear.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
