"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers based on the following rule:
1. Identifies non-zero, non-5 integers as ordered 'source values'.
2. Identifies consecutive sequences of the number 5 as 'target groups'.
3. Replaces all integers within the Nth target group with the Nth source value.
4. Keeps all other numbers (0s and original source values) unchanged in their positions.
The input is expected as a sequence of integers (like a list or NumPy array).
The output will be a list of integers.
