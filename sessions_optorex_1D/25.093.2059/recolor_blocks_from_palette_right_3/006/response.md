*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code consistently fails across all training and test examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a space-separated string, `input_str`) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array). The core transformation logic, which involves identifying source values and replacing groups of '5's, appears conceptually correct based on the initial analysis but cannot be executed due to this input type incompatibility.

    The strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to accept a sequence of integers (like a list or NumPy array) directly, eliminating the need for string splitting. The internal logic will then operate directly on this sequence.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Success Rate:** 0% (0 out of 7 training examples passed).
    *   **Failure Rate:** 100% (7 out of 7 training examples failed).
    *   **Common Error:** `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred in 100% of the failures.
    *   **Input Type:** The error confirms the test harness supplies the input as a NumPy array, not a string.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    constraints:
      - The number of placeholder groups (consecutive 5s) must equal the number of source values for the transformation to be fully defined as observed in examples.
      - The length of the output sequence must be identical to the length of the input sequence.
      - The positions of non-placeholder elements (0s and source values) are preserved in the output relative to each other.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input sequence of integers.
    2.  Create a list called `source_values` containing all numbers from the input sequence that are not 0 and not 5, maintaining their original relative order.
    3.  Initialize an index `source_index` to -1 (it will be incremented *before* first use).
    4.  Initialize a flag `processing_fives_group` to `False`.
    5.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
    6.  Iterate through the input sequence, number by number (`current_number`).
    7.  If `current_number` is 5:
        a.  If `processing_fives_group` is `False` (this is the start of a new group of 5s):
            i.  Set `processing_fives_group` to `True`.
            ii. Increment `source_index` by 1.
        b.  Retrieve the number at `source_values[source_index]` (handle potential index errors, though examples suggest this won't occur).
        c.  Append this retrieved number to `output_sequence`.
    8.  If `current_number` is not 5:
        a.  Set `processing_fives_group` to `False` (any group of 5s has ended).
        b.  Append the `current_number` to `output_sequence`.
    9.  Return the `output_sequence`.
