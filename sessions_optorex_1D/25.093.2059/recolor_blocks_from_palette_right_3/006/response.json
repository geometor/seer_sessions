            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The provided code consistently fails across all training and test examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a space-separated string, `input_str`) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array). The core transformation logic, which involves identifying source values and replacing groups of '5's, appears conceptually correct based on the initial analysis but cannot be executed due to this input type incompatibility.\n\n    The strategy to resolve this is to modify the `transform` function to accept a sequence of integers (like a list or NumPy array) directly, eliminating the need for string splitting. The internal logic will then operate directly on this sequence.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Success Rate:** 0% (0 out of 7 training examples passed).\n    *   **Failure Rate:** 100% (7 out of 7 training examples failed).\n    *   **Common Error:** `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred in 100% of the failures.\n    *   **Input Type:** The error confirms the test harness supplies the input as a NumPy array, not a string.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
