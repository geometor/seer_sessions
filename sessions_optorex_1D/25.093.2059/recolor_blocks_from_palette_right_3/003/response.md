    Transforms a sequence of integers based on the following rule:
    1. Identifies non-zero, non-5 integers as 'source values', preserving their order.
    2. Identifies consecutive sequences of the number 5 as 'groups of 5s'.
    3. Replaces each number within the nth group of 5s with the nth source value.
    4. Keeps all other numbers (0s and the original source values) unchanged.
