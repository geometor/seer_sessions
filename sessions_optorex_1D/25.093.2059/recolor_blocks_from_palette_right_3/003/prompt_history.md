*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are space-separated sequences of single-digit integers.
    *   The core operation involves replacing occurrences of the number '5' in the input sequence.
    *   The numbers '0' seem to act as separators or placeholders that remain unchanged.
    *   Non-zero numbers other than '5' serve as source values for the replacement.
    *   The replacement is context-dependent: the value used to replace '5's depends on the non-zero, non-'5' numbers encountered earlier in the sequence.
    *   Consecutive sequences of '5's are treated as distinct groups. The first group of '5's uses the first non-zero source value, the second group uses the second non-zero source value, and so on.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input sequence of numbers.
    2.  Create a list called `replacement_values` containing all the numbers from the input sequence that are not 0 and not 5, maintaining their original order.
    3.  Initialize a counter `replacement_index` to 0.
    4.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
    5.  Iterate through the input sequence, number by number, keeping track of the index `i`.
    6.  For each number `current_number` at index `i`:
        a.  If `current_number` is not 5, append `current_number` to the `output_sequence`.
        b.  If `current_number` is 5:
            i.  Check if it's the start of a new group of 5s (i.e., either `i` is 0 or the previous number `input[i-1]` was not 5).
            ii. If it is the start of a new group, retrieve the number at `replacement_values[replacement_index]`, append this number to `output_sequence`, and then increment `replacement_index` by 1.
            iii. If it is *not* the start of a new group (meaning the previous number was also 5), retrieve the number at `replacement_values[replacement_index - 1]` (using the *same* index as the previous 5) and append this number to `output_sequence`.
    7.  Convert the `output_sequence` back into a space-separated string.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue identified is a mismatch between the expected input type (assumed `str`) and the actual input type (`numpy.ndarray`) passed to the `transform` function during testing. The core transformation logic described in the previous natural language program (identifying source values, identifying groups of 5s, and replacing the nth group with the nth source value) appears consistent with all provided training examples. The strategy is to correct the perception of the input/output data format and update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) accordingly. The underlying algorithm remains the same.

*   **Metrics:**
    The code execution failed due to a type error (`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) on all examples. This confirms the input is not a string. Manual verification of the examples against the previously defined logic shows:
    *   **Example 1:** Source `[6, 9]`. Groups `[5, 5]`, `[5, 5]`. Output replaces 1st group with 6, 2nd with 9. Correct.
    *   **Example 2:** Source `[9]`. Group `[5, 5, 5]`. Output replaces group with 9. Correct.
    *   **Example 3:** Source `[2]`. Group `[5, 5]`. Output replaces group with 2. Correct.
    *   **Example 4:** Source `[3]`. Group `[5, 5]`. Output replaces group with 3. Correct.
    *   **Example 5:** Source `[9, 2]`. Groups `[5, 5, 5]`, `[5, 5, 5]`. Output replaces 1st group with 9, 2nd with 2. Correct.
    *   **Example 6:** Source `[6, 2]`. Groups `[5, 5, 5]`, `[5, 5, 5]`. Output replaces 1st group with 6, 2nd with 2. Correct.
    *   **Example 7:** Source `[7, 1]`. Groups `[5, 5]`, `[5, 5]`. Output replaces 1st group with 7, 2nd with 1. Correct.
    The logical pattern holds true across all examples.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of integers (e.g., a list or array).
    2.  Create a list called `replacement_values` by filtering the input sequence to include only numbers that are not 0 and not 5, maintaining their original relative order.
    3.  Initialize a counter `replacement_index` to 0 (this will track which replacement value to use next).
    4.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
    5.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from 0 to length-1.
    6.  Let `current_number` be the number at `input_sequence[i]`.
    7.  If `current_number` is not 5, append `current_number` directly to the `output_sequence`.
    8.  If `current_number` is 5:
        a.  Check if this 5 is the start of a new group. This is true if `i` is 0, or if `input_sequence[i-1]` is not 5.
        b.  If it is the start of a new group:
            i.  Retrieve the value from `replacement_values` at the current `replacement_index`.
            ii. Append this retrieved value to the `output_sequence`.
            iii. Increment the `replacement_index` by 1 to prepare for the next group.
        c.  If it is *not* the start of a new group (i.e., `i > 0` and `input_sequence[i-1]` was also 5):
            i.  Retrieve the value from `replacement_values` at index `replacement_index - 1` (using the same index determined when the group started).
            ii. Append this retrieved value to the `output_sequence`.
    9.  Return the final `output_sequence`.
