*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are space-separated sequences of single-digit integers.
    *   The core operation involves replacing occurrences of the number '5' in the input sequence.
    *   The numbers '0' seem to act as separators or placeholders that remain unchanged.
    *   Non-zero numbers other than '5' serve as source values for the replacement.
    *   The replacement is context-dependent: the value used to replace '5's depends on the non-zero, non-'5' numbers encountered earlier in the sequence.
    *   Consecutive sequences of '5's are treated as distinct groups. The first group of '5's uses the first non-zero source value, the second group uses the second non-zero source value, and so on.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input sequence of numbers.
    2.  Create a list called `replacement_values` containing all the numbers from the input sequence that are not 0 and not 5, maintaining their original order.
    3.  Initialize a counter `replacement_index` to 0.
    4.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
    5.  Iterate through the input sequence, number by number, keeping track of the index `i`.
    6.  For each number `current_number` at index `i`:
        a.  If `current_number` is not 5, append `current_number` to the `output_sequence`.
        b.  If `current_number` is 5:
            i.  Check if it's the start of a new group of 5s (i.e., either `i` is 0 or the previous number `input[i-1]` was not 5).
            ii. If it is the start of a new group, retrieve the number at `replacement_values[replacement_index]`, append this number to `output_sequence`, and then increment `replacement_index` by 1.
            iii. If it is *not* the start of a new group (meaning the previous number was also 5), retrieve the number at `replacement_values[replacement_index - 1]` (using the *same* index as the previous 5) and append this number to `output_sequence`.
    7.  Convert the `output_sequence` back into a space-separated string.
