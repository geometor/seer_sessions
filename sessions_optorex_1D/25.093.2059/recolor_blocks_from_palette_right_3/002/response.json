            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary issue identified is a mismatch between the expected input type (assumed `str`) and the actual input type (`numpy.ndarray`) passed to the `transform` function during testing. The core transformation logic described in the previous natural language program (identifying source values, identifying groups of 5s, and replacing the nth group with the nth source value) appears consistent with all provided training examples. The strategy is to correct the perception of the input/output data format and update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) accordingly. The underlying algorithm remains the same.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The code execution failed due to a type error (`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) on all examples. This confirms the input is not a string. Manual verification of the examples against the previously defined logic shows:\n    *   **Example 1:** Source `[6, 9]`. Groups `[5, 5]`, `[5, 5]`. Output replaces 1st group with 6, 2nd with 9. Correct.\n    *   **Example 2:** Source `[9]`. Group `[5, 5, 5]`. Output replaces group with 9. Correct.\n    *   **Example 3:** Source `[2]`. Group `[5, 5]`. Output replaces group with 2. Correct.\n    *   **Example 4:** Source `[3]`. Group `[5, 5]`. Output replaces group with 3. Correct.\n    *   **Example 5:** Source `[9, 2]`. Groups `[5, 5, 5]`, `[5, 5, 5]`. Output replaces 1st group with 9, 2nd with 2. Correct.\n    *   **Example 6:** Source `[6, 2]`. Groups `[5, 5, 5]`, `[5, 5, 5]`. Output replaces 1st group with 6, 2nd with 2. Correct.\n    *   **Example 7:** Source `[7, 1]`. Groups `[5, 5]`, `[5, 5]`. Output replaces 1st group with 7, 2nd with 1. Correct.\n    The logical pattern holds true across all examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
