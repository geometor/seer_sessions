            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe previous code attempt failed to implement the core replacement logic. While the identification of non-zero numbers (potential replacements) and the overall iteration structure might have been present, the step where the placeholder `5` was actually substituted with the appropriate replacement number from the source list was missing or incorrect, resulting in the input being copied almost verbatim.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the placeholder is indeed `5`. The replacements come from the sequence of *all* non-zero numbers in the input, used in the order they appear. Contiguous blocks of `5`s in the input are replaced by repeating the *same* replacement number, and each new block uses the *next* available replacement number.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program to be extremely clear about the sequential mapping between non-zero input numbers and blocks of `5`s, and how this mapping drives the replacement during iteration. The implementation must correctly fetch and apply the replacement value for each `5` encountered.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the confirmed logic (especially handling Example 3 correctly):\n\n*   **Input/Output Length:** Consistently 12 integers for all provided examples.\n*   **Placeholder Value:** The integer `5` acts as the placeholder marker in the input sequence, indicating positions to be potentially replaced.\n*   **Replacement Source:** The values used for replacement are derived from the sequence of *all non-zero* integers found in the input list, preserving their original order. For example:\n    *   Input `3 4 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0`: Source `[3, 4]`\n    *   Input `8 1 4 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5`: Source `[8, 1, 4]`\n    *   Input `2 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0`: Source `[2, 5]` (The '5' at index 1 is a source number)\n*   **Placeholder Blocks:** Contiguous sequences of one or more `5`s in the input.\n*   **Mapping:** There is a one-to-one mapping between the sequence of replacement source numbers and the sequence of placeholder blocks encountered when iterating through the input.\n    *   Ex 1: Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `3` (1st non-zero); Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `4` (2nd non-zero)\n    *   Ex 2: Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `8`; Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `1`; Block 3 (`5 5`) -> `4`\n    *   Ex 3: Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `2`; Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `5` (The '5' from input index 1)\n*   **Output Construction:** Non-`5` input values are copied directly. Each `5` in the input is replaced by the corresponding replacement value determined for its block.\n\n**Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
