**General Assessment**

The previous code attempt failed to implement the core replacement logic. While the identification of non-zero numbers (potential replacements) and the overall iteration structure might have been present, the step where the placeholder `5` was actually substituted with the appropriate replacement number from the source list was missing or incorrect, resulting in the input being copied almost verbatim.

The analysis confirms that the placeholder is indeed `5`. The replacements come from the sequence of *all* non-zero numbers in the input, used in the order they appear. Contiguous blocks of `5`s in the input are replaced by repeating the *same* replacement number, and each new block uses the *next* available replacement number.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program to be extremely clear about the sequential mapping between non-zero input numbers and blocks of `5`s, and how this mapping drives the replacement during iteration. The implementation must correctly fetch and apply the replacement value for each `5` encountered.

**Metrics Analysis**

Based on the analysis of the examples and the confirmed logic (especially handling Example 3 correctly):

*   **Input/Output Length:** Consistently 12 integers for all provided examples.
*   **Placeholder Value:** The integer `5` acts as the placeholder marker in the input sequence, indicating positions to be potentially replaced.
*   **Replacement Source:** The values used for replacement are derived from the sequence of *all non-zero* integers found in the input list, preserving their original order. For example:
    *   Input `3 4 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0`: Source `[3, 4]`
    *   Input `8 1 4 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5`: Source `[8, 1, 4]`
    *   Input `2 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0`: Source `[2, 5]` (The '5' at index 1 is a source number)
*   **Placeholder Blocks:** Contiguous sequences of one or more `5`s in the input.
*   **Mapping:** There is a one-to-one mapping between the sequence of replacement source numbers and the sequence of placeholder blocks encountered when iterating through the input.
    *   Ex 1: Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `3` (1st non-zero); Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `4` (2nd non-zero)
    *   Ex 2: Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `8`; Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `1`; Block 3 (`5 5`) -> `4`
    *   Ex 3: Block 1 (`5 5`) -> `2`; Block 2 (`5 5`) -> `5` (The '5' from input index 1)
*   **Output Construction:** Non-`5` input values are copied directly. Each `5` in the input is replaced by the corresponding replacement value determined for its block.

**Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Replace contiguous blocks of a specific placeholder value (5) in an integer sequence.

Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
      values: Single-digit integers (0-9).
  - Output_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
      derivation: Transformation of Input_Sequence.
  - Placeholder_Value:
      value: 5
      role: Identifies elements within the Input_Sequence that are part of a block designated for replacement.
  - Replacement_Source_List:
      type: List[int]
      source: Extracted non-zero integers from Input_Sequence.
      order: Preserves the original relative order from Input_Sequence.
      role: Provides the sequence of values used for replacing Placeholder_Blocks.
      example: For input `[2, 5, 0, 5, 5]`, the list is `[2, 5]`.
  - Placeholder_Block:
      type: Contiguous subsequence within Input_Sequence.
      composition: One or more instances of Placeholder_Value (5).
      role: Represents a unit that will be entirely replaced by a single value from the Replacement_Source_List.
  - Replacement_Index:
      type: Integer (0-based)
      role: Tracks the next value to be used from the Replacement_Source_List.
  - Current_Replacement_Value:
      type: Integer
      role: Stores the specific replacement value being applied to the current Placeholder_Block being processed.

Relationships:
  - Sequential_Mapping: The Nth Placeholder_Block encountered during iteration maps to the Nth value in the Replacement_Source_List.
  - Preservation: Integers in the Input_Sequence that are not the Placeholder_Value (5) retain their value and position in the Output_Sequence.
  - Block_Uniformity: All elements within a single Placeholder_Block in the Input_Sequence are replaced by the *same* single value (the Current_Replacement_Value for that block) in the Output_Sequence.

Actions:
  - Extract_Replacements: Create the Replacement_Source_List by iterating through the Input_Sequence and collecting all non-zero values in order.
  - Iterate_Input: Process the Input_Sequence element by element using an index `i`.
  - Initialize_Output: Create an empty list for the Output_Sequence.
  - Initialize_Index: Set Replacement_Index to 0.
  - Check_Value: At each element `input[i]`:
      - If `input[i]` is not Placeholder_Value (5), append `input[i]` to Output_Sequence.
      - If `input[i]` is Placeholder_Value (5):
          - Detect_New_Block: Check if it is the start of a new Placeholder_Block (i.e., `i == 0` or `input[i-1] != 5`).
          - Fetch_Replacement: If it's a new block, retrieve the value from `Replacement_Source_List` at the current `Replacement_Index`, store it as `Current_Replacement_Value`, and increment `Replacement_Index`.
          - Append_Replacement: Append the `Current_Replacement_Value` (either newly fetched or carried over from the previous element in the same block) to the Output_Sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create an empty list called `replacement_source`. Iterate through the input sequence from start to end. If an element is not zero, add it to the `replacement_source` list. This list now contains all non-zero numbers from the input, in their original order.
2.  Initialize a `replacement_idx` to `0`. This index will track which number to use next from the `replacement_source` list.
3.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
4.  Initialize a variable `current_block_replacement_value` to store the replacement number for the block of `5`s currently being processed (it can be initialized to `None` or a sentinel value).
5.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from `0` to `length - 1`. Let the element at the current index be `current_input_value`.
6.  If `current_input_value` is **not** `5`:
    *   Append `current_input_value` directly to the `output_sequence`.
7.  If `current_input_value` **is** `5`:
    *   Check if this is the start of a new block of `5`s. This is true if `i` is `0` OR if the previous element (`input_sequence[i-1]`) was not `5`.
    *   If it is the start of a new block:
        *   Retrieve the number from `replacement_source` at the current `replacement_idx`.
        *   Store this retrieved number in `current_block_replacement_value`.
        *   Increment the `replacement_idx` by 1 to prepare for the next block.
    *   Append the `current_block_replacement_value` (which was either just fetched for the start of this block or carried over from the previous step if it's inside the same block) to the `output_sequence`.
8.  After iterating through all elements of the input sequence, the `output_sequence` contains the complete transformed result.
