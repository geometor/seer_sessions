Task: Replace placeholder values (5) in a sequence of integers based on preceding non-zero values.

Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray[int] # Updated based on error
      length: Variable (Observed as 12 in examples)
      contains: Single-digit integers (0-9)
  - Output_Sequence:
      type: List[int] # Coder will likely produce a list
      length: Same as Input_Sequence
      derivation: Transformation of Input_Sequence
  - Placeholder_Value:
      value: 5
      role: Indicates positions to be filled in the output. Treated differently from non-placeholder 5s if they exist.
  - Replacement_Values:
      type: List[int]
      source: Non-zero integers extracted sequentially from Input_Sequence.
      role: Values used to replace Placeholder_Value groups.
  - Placeholder_Group:
      type: Contiguous subsequence within Input_Sequence
      composition: One or more Placeholder_Value (5)
      role: Unit to be replaced entirely by a single Replacement_Value.

Relationships:
  - Mapping: Each Placeholder_Group encountered sequentially in the Input_Sequence maps to the next available value from the Replacement_Values list.
  - Preservation: Integers in the Input_Sequence that are not part of a Placeholder_Group retain their value and position in the Output_Sequence.
  - Order: The order of Replacement_Values used corresponds directly to the order of Placeholder_Groups encountered when scanning the Input_Sequence from left to right.

Actions:
  - Extract_Replacements: Identify and collect all non-zero integers from the Input_Sequence into the Replacement_Values list, preserving their original relative order.
  - Iterate_And_Transform: Process the Input_Sequence element by element.
  - Identify_Group_And_Replace: When a Placeholder_Value (5) is encountered, check if it's the start of a new Placeholder_Group. If it is, retrieve the next value from Replacement_Values. Replace this element and all subsequent contiguous Placeholder_Values in the group with this retrieved value.
  - Copy_Non_Placeholders: Transfer elements that are not part of a Placeholder_Group directly from Input_Sequence to Output_Sequence.
