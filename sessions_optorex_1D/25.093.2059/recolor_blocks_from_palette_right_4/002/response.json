            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code failed execution across all examples due to a fundamental type mismatch. The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates the `transform` function received a NumPy array as input, whereas the helper function `_parse_input_string` expected a space-separated string. The core transformation logic (identifying non-zero numbers and using them to replace consecutive blocks of 5s sequentially) appears sound based on the examples, but the implementation needs modification to handle list/array inputs directly, eliminating the string parsing step.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nSince the code failed to execute, runtime metrics are unavailable. The analysis will focus on the structural properties of the input/output pairs to confirm the transformation rule.\n\n*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be NumPy array of integers based on the error message.\n*   **Output Type:** Expected to be a list or array of integers matching the length of the input.\n*   **Placeholder Value:** The integer `5` consistently acts as a placeholder in the input.\n*   **Replacement Source:** Non-zero integers extracted from the input sequence, maintaining their original order.\n*   **Replacement Mechanism:** Contiguous blocks of `5`s in the input are replaced. Each block is replaced entirely by the *next available* non-zero number from the extracted list.\n\nLet's verify the replacement source and sequence for each example:\n\n*   **train_1:** Input non-zeros: `[3, 4]`. Input `5` groups: `[5, 5]` (indices 4,5), `[5, 5]` (indices 7,8). Output replaces 1st group with `3`, 2nd group with `4`. **CONFIRMED**.\n*   **train_2:** Input non-zeros: `[8, 1, 4]`. Input `5` groups: `[5, 5]` (4,5), `[5, 5]` (7,8), `[5, 5]` (10,11). Output replaces 1st group with `8`, 2nd with `1`, 3rd with `4`. **CONFIRMED**.\n*   **train_3:** Input non-zeros: `[2, 5]`. Input `5` groups: `[5, 5]` (5,6), `[5, 5]` (8,9). Note the input `5` at index 1 is *not* a placeholder group. Output replaces 1st group with `2`, 2nd with `5`. **CONFIRMED**.\n*   **train_4:** Input non-zeros: `[4]`. Input `5` groups: `[5, 5, 5]` (7,8,9). Output replaces 1st group with `4`. **CONFIRMED**.\n*   **train_5:** Input non-zeros: `[3, 1]`. Input `5` groups: `[5, 5]` (4,5), `[5, 5]` (10,11). Output replaces 1st group with `3`, 2nd with `1`. **CONFIRMED**.\n*   **train_6:** Input non-zeros: `[4, 8]`. Input `5` groups: `[5, 5]` (6,7), `[5, 5]` (10,11). Output replaces 1st group with `4`, 2nd with `8`. **CONFIRMED**.\n*   **train_7:** Input non-zeros: `[4, 7]`. Input `5` groups: `[5, 5, 5]` (4,5,6), `[5, 5, 5]` (9,10,11). Output replaces 1st group with `4`, 2nd with `7`. **CONFIRMED**.\n\nThe pattern identified previously holds true for all examples. The correction needed is purely technical regarding input handling.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
