It acts as a placeholder.\n3.  **Replacement Source:** The numbers used to replace the `5`s are derived from the non-zero numbers present at the beginning (or generally, throughout) the *input* sequence itself.\n4.  **Replacement Pattern:** Contiguous blocks of `5`s in the input are replaced by blocks of the *same* number in the output.\n5.  **Replacement Order:** The replacement numbers are used sequentially based on the order of the non-zero numbers appearing in the input. The first block of `5`s uses the first non-zero number from the input, the second block of `5`s uses the second non-zero number, and so on.\n6.  **Unaffected Numbers:** Numbers other than `5` in the input remain unchanged in their position and value in the output. Even if a non-zero number is used as a replacement value later, its original occurrences in the input are preserved.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
