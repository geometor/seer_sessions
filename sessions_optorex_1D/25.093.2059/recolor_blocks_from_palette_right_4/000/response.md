Okay, let's break down the transformation logic.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Number:** The number `5` appears frequently in the input and is consistently replaced in the output. It acts as a placeholder.
3.  **Replacement Source:** The numbers used to replace the `5`s are derived from the non-zero numbers present at the beginning (or generally, throughout) the *input* sequence itself.
4.  **Replacement Pattern:** Contiguous blocks of `5`s in the input are replaced by blocks of the *same* number in the output.
5.  **Replacement Order:** The replacement numbers are used sequentially based on the order of the non-zero numbers appearing in the input. The first block of `5`s uses the first non-zero number from the input, the second block of `5`s uses the second non-zero number, and so on.
6.  **Unaffected Numbers:** Numbers other than `5` in the input remain unchanged in their position and value in the output. Even if a non-zero number is used as a replacement value later, its original occurrences in the input are preserved.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Replace placeholder values in a sequence based on preceding non-zero values.

Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
      contains: Single-digit integers (0-9)
  - Output_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
      derivation: Transformation of Input_Sequence
  - Placeholder_Value:
      value: 5
      role: Indicates positions to be filled in the output.
  - Replacement_Values:
      type: List[int]
      source: Non-zero integers extracted from Input_Sequence, maintaining their original order.
      role: Values used to replace Placeholder_Value.
  - Placeholder_Group:
      type: Contiguous subsequence within Input_Sequence
      composition: One or more Placeholder_Value (5)
      role: Unit to be replaced by a single Replacement_Value.

Relationships:
  - Mapping: Each Placeholder_Group in the Input_Sequence maps sequentially to one value from the Replacement_Values list.
  - Preservation: Integers in the Input_Sequence that are not Placeholder_Value retain their value and position in the Output_Sequence.
  - Order: The order of Replacement_Values used corresponds to the order of Placeholder_Groups encountered when scanning the Input_Sequence.

Actions:
  - Extract: Identify and collect all non-zero integers from the Input_Sequence into the Replacement_Values list, preserving order.
  - Iterate: Process the Input_Sequence element by element.
  - Identify_Group: Detect the start and end of each contiguous Placeholder_Group.
  - Replace: For each Placeholder_Group, substitute all its elements with the next available value from the Replacement_Values list.
  - Copy: Transfer non-Placeholder_Value elements directly from Input_Sequence to Output_Sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create an empty list called `replacement_numbers`. Iterate through the input sequence and add every non-zero number encountered to the `replacement_numbers` list, maintaining the order of appearance.
2.  Initialize an index `replacement_idx` to 0, pointing to the first number in `replacement_numbers`.
3.  Create an empty output sequence.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i`.
5.  If the number at index `i` in the input sequence is not `5`, append this number to the output sequence.
6.  If the number at index `i` in the input sequence is `5`:
    a.  Check if this is the start of a new group of `5`s (i.e., if `i` is 0 or the number at index `i-1` was not `5`).
    b.  If it is the start of a new group, retrieve the number from `replacement_numbers` at the current `replacement_idx` and store it as the `current_replacement`. Increment `replacement_idx` by 1 for the next group.
    c.  Append the `current_replacement` number (determined in step 6b, or carried over from the previous `5` in the same group) to the output sequence.
7.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, the output sequence contains the transformed result.
