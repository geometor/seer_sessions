Task: Replace placeholder values in a sequence based on preceding non-zero values.

Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
      contains: Single-digit integers (0-9)
  - Output_Sequence:
      type: List[int]
      length: 12
      derivation: Transformation of Input_Sequence
  - Placeholder_Value:
      value: 5
      role: Indicates positions to be filled in the output.
  - Replacement_Values:
      type: List[int]
      source: Non-zero integers extracted from Input_Sequence, maintaining their original order.
      role: Values used to replace Placeholder_Value.
  - Placeholder_Group:
      type: Contiguous subsequence within Input_Sequence
      composition: One or more Placeholder_Value (5)
      role: Unit to be replaced by a single Replacement_Value.

Relationships:
  - Mapping: Each Placeholder_Group in the Input_Sequence maps sequentially to one value from the Replacement_Values list.
  - Preservation: Integers in the Input_Sequence that are not Placeholder_Value retain their value and position in the Output_Sequence.
  - Order: The order of Replacement_Values used corresponds to the order of Placeholder_Groups encountered when scanning the Input_Sequence.

Actions:
  - Extract: Identify and collect all non-zero integers from the Input_Sequence into the Replacement_Values list, preserving order.
  - Iterate: Process the Input_Sequence element by element.
  - Identify_Group: Detect the start and end of each contiguous Placeholder_Group.
  - Replace: For each Placeholder_Group, substitute all its elements with the next available value from the Replacement_Values list.
  - Copy: Transfer non-Placeholder_Value elements directly from Input_Sequence to Output_Sequence.
