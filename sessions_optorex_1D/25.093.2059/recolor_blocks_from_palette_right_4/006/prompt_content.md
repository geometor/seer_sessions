"""
Transforms a sequence of integers by replacing contiguous blocks of the placeholder value '5'. 
The replacement values are sourced sequentially from the non-zero numbers present in the 
original input sequence, maintaining their original order. Numbers other than '5' remain 
unchanged in the output sequence.

    Extracts all non-zero numbers from the input list, preserving order.
