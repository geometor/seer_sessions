Accept the input as a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.\n2. Identify the integer at index 0 as key1 and the integer at index 1 as key2. Define the target_value as 5.\n3. Initialize an output_sequence as a copy of the input_sequence.\n4. Find all contiguous subsequences (runs) within the input_sequence consisting solely of the target_value (5), where the starting index of the run is 2 or greater. Store these runs (e.g., as pairs of start index and length) in the order they appear. Let's call this list candidate_runs.\n5. Check if candidate_runs contains at least one run AND if key1 is not equal to target_value. If both conditions are true:\n    * Get the start index and length of the *first* run in candidate_runs.\n    * In the output_sequence, replace the elements from that start index for that length with the value key1.\n6. Check if candidate_runs contains at least two runs AND if key2 is not equal to target_value. If both conditions are true:\n    * Get the start index and length of the *second* run in candidate_runs.\n    * In the output_sequence, replace the elements from that start index for that length with the value key2.\n7.
