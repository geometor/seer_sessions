            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core components (keys, target value, runs of 5s) but misinterpreted the exact replacement logic and conditions. The consistent error message (\"Input sequence must contain exactly 12 integers\") across all examples was due to a mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (list/array) and the actual input provided during testing (string). The previous code version expected a sequence object rather than parsing the input string.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n\n1.  **Correcting Input Handling:** Ensure the program correctly parses the input string of space-separated integers into a list of integers.\n2.  **Refining the Logic:** Based on a detailed re-examination of all examples, the transformation rule is more nuanced. The replacement of the first and second runs of '5' (occurring *after* the first two elements) is conditional on whether `key1` and `key2` (the first two elements) are themselves equal to '5'.\n3.  **Updating Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the corrected input handling and refined transformation logic.\n4.  **Formatting Output:** Ensure the final output is formatted back into a space-separated string.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nThe `tool_code` execution confirmed the refined hypothesis:\n\n*   **Input Parsing:** The code correctly converts the input string `\"5 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5\"` into the list `[5, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]`.\n*   **Key Identification:** `key1` is correctly identified as `5`, and `key2` as `1`.\n*   **Run Identification (Post-Keys):** Runs of `5` starting from index 2 are correctly identified as `[(4, 3), (9, 3)]`.\n*   **Conditional Replacement Logic:**\n    *   For Example 1 (`key1=5`, `key2=1`): The first run (index 4) is *not* replaced because `key1 == 5`. The second run (index 9) *is* replaced with `key2=1` because `key2 != 5`. This yields `5 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 1 1 1`, matching the expected output.\n    *   For Example 2 (`key1=6`, `key2=5`): Runs of `5` starting from index 2 are `[(3, 2), (9, 2)]`. The first run (index 3) *is* replaced with `key1=6` because `key1 != 5`. The second run (index 9) is *not* replaced because `key2 == 5`. This yields `6 5 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 5 5 0`, matching the expected output.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The final list is correctly formatted back into a space-separated string.\n\nThis revised logic successfully explains all provided training examples.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation**\n\n"
