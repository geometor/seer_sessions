**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core components (keys, target value, runs of 5s) but misinterpreted the exact replacement logic and conditions. The consistent error message ("Input sequence must contain exactly 12 integers") across all examples was due to a mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (list/array) and the actual input provided during testing (string). The previous code version expected a sequence object rather than parsing the input string.

The strategy involves:

1.  **Correcting Input Handling:** Ensure the program correctly parses the input string of space-separated integers into a list of integers.
2.  **Refining the Logic:** Based on a detailed re-examination of all examples, the transformation rule is more nuanced. The replacement of the first and second runs of '5' (occurring *after* the first two elements) is conditional on whether `key1` and `key2` (the first two elements) are themselves equal to '5'.
3.  **Updating Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the corrected input handling and refined transformation logic.
4.  **Formatting Output:** Ensure the final output is formatted back into a space-separated string.

**Metrics and Verification**

The `tool_code` execution confirmed the refined hypothesis:

*   **Input Parsing:** The code correctly converts the input string `"5 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5"` into the list `[5, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]`.
*   **Key Identification:** `key1` is correctly identified as `5`, and `key2` as `1`.
*   **Run Identification (Post-Keys):** Runs of `5` starting from index 2 are correctly identified as `[(4, 3), (9, 3)]`.
*   **Conditional Replacement Logic:**
    *   For Example 1 (`key1=5`, `key2=1`): The first run (index 4) is *not* replaced because `key1 == 5`. The second run (index 9) *is* replaced with `key2=1` because `key2 != 5`. This yields `5 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 1 1 1`, matching the expected output.
    *   For Example 2 (`key1=6`, `key2=5`): Runs of `5` starting from index 2 are `[(3, 2), (9, 2)]`. The first run (index 3) *is* replaced with `key1=6` because `key1 != 5`. The second run (index 9) is *not* replaced because `key2 == 5`. This yields `6 5 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 5 5 0`, matching the expected output.
*   **Output Formatting:** The final list is correctly formatted back into a space-separated string.

This revised logic successfully explains all provided training examples.

```yaml
Task: Conditional Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputString:
      Type: str
      Format: 12 space-separated integers.
      Example: "5 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5"
  - OutputString:
      Type: str
      Format: 12 space-separated integers.
      Derivation: Transformation of InputString.
      Example: "5 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 1 1 1"
  - IntegerSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Length: 12
      Derivation: Parsed from InputString.
  - Key1:
      Type: int
      Source: IntegerSequence[0]
      Role: Potential first replacement value.
  - Key2:
      Type: int
      Source: IntegerSequence[1]
      Role: Potential second replacement value.
  - TargetValue:
      Type: int
      Value: 5
      Role: Value defining the runs to be potentially replaced.
  - RelevantSubsequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Source: IntegerSequence[2:] (elements from index 2 to 11)
      Role: The portion of the sequence scanned for TargetValue runs.
  - TargetRun:
      Type: Tuple[int, int] # (start_index, length)
      Properties: A contiguous subsequence within RelevantSubsequence where all elements are TargetValue. Indices are relative to the start of the original IntegerSequence.
      Occurrence: Can appear multiple times within RelevantSubsequence. Ordered by appearance.

Actions:
  - ParseInput: Convert InputString into IntegerSequence.
  - IdentifyKeys: Extract Key1 and Key2 from IntegerSequence.
  - FindRunsInSubsequence: Locate all TargetRuns within RelevantSubsequence, noting their original start index and length.
  - InitializeOutput: Create a modifiable copy of IntegerSequence.
  - ConditionallyReplaceFirstRun:
      Condition: Check if Key1 is not equal to TargetValue AND at least one TargetRun was found.
      Action: If condition met, replace the elements of the *first* found TargetRun in the output copy with Key1.
  - ConditionallyReplaceSecondRun:
      Condition: Check if Key2 is not equal to TargetValue AND at least *two* TargetRuns were found.
      Action: If condition met, replace the elements of the *second* found TargetRun in the output copy with Key2.
  - FormatOutput: Convert the modified output list back into OutputString format.

Relationships:
  - OutputString is derived from InputString via intermediate list processing.
  - Replacement actions target specific ordered runs (first, second) found *after* the first two elements.
  - Replacement of a run is conditional on the corresponding key (Key1 for first run, Key2 for second run) *not* being equal to the TargetValue (5).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Read the input as a single string containing 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string into a sequence (list) of 12 integers.
3.  Identify the first integer in the sequence as `key1` and the second integer as `key2`. The target value for replacement is `5`.
4.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
5.  Scan the input sequence, starting from the *third* element (index 2) to the end, to find all contiguous subsequences (runs) consisting solely of the target value `5`. Record the starting index (relative to the original sequence) and length of each run found, in the order they appear.
6.  Check if `key1` is *not* equal to `5`. If it is not, AND if at least one run of `5`s was found in step 5:
    *   Locate the elements in the output sequence corresponding to the *first* run found in step 5 (using its recorded start index and length).
    *   Replace these elements with the value `key1`.
7.  Check if `key2` is *not* equal to `5`. If it is not, AND if at least *two* runs of `5`s were found in step 5:
    *   Locate the elements in the output sequence corresponding to the *second* run found in step 5 (using its recorded start index and length).
    *   Replace these elements with the value `key2`.
8.  Convert the potentially modified output sequence back into a string of 12 space-separated integers.
9.  Return the resulting string.
