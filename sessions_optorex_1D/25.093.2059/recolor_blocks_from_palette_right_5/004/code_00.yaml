Task: Conditional Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputString:
      Type: str
      Format: 12 space-separated integers.
      Example: "5 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5"
  - OutputString:
      Type: str
      Format: 12 space-separated integers.
      Derivation: Transformation of InputString.
      Example: "5 1 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 1 1 1"
  - IntegerSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Length: 12
      Derivation: Parsed from InputString.
  - Key1:
      Type: int
      Source: IntegerSequence[0]
      Role: Potential first replacement value.
  - Key2:
      Type: int
      Source: IntegerSequence[1]
      Role: Potential second replacement value.
  - TargetValue:
      Type: int
      Value: 5
      Role: Value defining the runs to be potentially replaced.
  - RelevantSubsequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Source: IntegerSequence[2:] (elements from index 2 to 11)
      Role: The portion of the sequence scanned for TargetValue runs.
  - TargetRun:
      Type: Tuple[int, int] # (start_index, length)
      Properties: A contiguous subsequence within RelevantSubsequence where all elements are TargetValue. Indices are relative to the start of the original IntegerSequence.
      Occurrence: Can appear multiple times within RelevantSubsequence. Ordered by appearance.

Actions:
  - ParseInput: Convert InputString into IntegerSequence.
  - IdentifyKeys: Extract Key1 and Key2 from IntegerSequence.
  - FindRunsInSubsequence: Locate all TargetRuns within RelevantSubsequence, noting their original start index and length.
  - InitializeOutput: Create a modifiable copy of IntegerSequence.
  - ConditionallyReplaceFirstRun:
      Condition: Check if Key1 is not equal to TargetValue AND at least one TargetRun was found.
      Action: If condition met, replace the elements of the *first* found TargetRun in the output copy with Key1.
  - ConditionallyReplaceSecondRun:
      Condition: Check if Key2 is not equal to TargetValue AND at least *two* TargetRuns were found.
      Action: If condition met, replace the elements of the *second* found TargetRun in the output copy with Key2.
  - FormatOutput: Convert the modified output list back into OutputString format.

Relationships:
  - OutputString is derived from InputString via intermediate list processing.
  - Replacement actions target specific ordered runs (first, second) found *after* the first two elements.
  - Replacement of a run is conditional on the corresponding key (Key1 for first run, Key2 for second run) *not* being equal to the TargetValue (5).
