Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are fixed-length sequences of 12 integers.
2.  **Key Information:** The first two integers in the input sequence appear to act as replacement values. Let's designate the first integer (at index 0) as `key1` and the second integer (at index 1) as `key2`.
3.  **Target Element:** The integer `5` is the primary target for modification within the sequence.
4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves identifying contiguous subsequences (runs) composed entirely of the integer `5`.
5.  **Replacement Rule:** The *first* identified run of `5`s is replaced by a run of the same length, but using the value `key1`. The *second* identified run of `5`s is replaced by a run of the same length, but using the value `key2`. Any subsequent runs of `5`s are left unchanged. Other numbers in the sequence remain in their original positions.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Length: 12
      Properties: Contains integers.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Length: 12
      Properties: Derived from InputSequence.
  - Key1:
      Type: int
      Source: InputSequence[0]
      Role: First replacement value.
  - Key2:
      Type: int
      Source: InputSequence[1]
      Role: Second replacement value.
  - TargetValue:
      Type: int
      Value: 5
      Role: Value to be replaced in sequences.
  - FiveSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Properties: A contiguous subsequence within InputSequence where all elements are TargetValue (5).
      Occurrence: Can appear multiple times.

Actions:
  - IdentifyRuns: Locate all contiguous FiveSequences within the InputSequence.
  - ReplaceFirstRun: Modify the elements of the first identified FiveSequence to Key1.
  - ReplaceSecondRun: Modify the elements of the second identified FiveSequence to Key2.
  - CopyRemaining: All other elements from InputSequence are copied to OutputSequence without modification, including any FiveSequences found after the first two.

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is a transformation of InputSequence.
  - The values used for replacement (Key1, Key2) are determined by the first two elements of the InputSequence.
  - The replacement action targets specific occurrences (first and second) of FiveSequences.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the value of the first integer as `key1` and the value of the second integer as `key2`.
3.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
4.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to find all contiguous subsequences consisting solely of the number `5`. Keep track of these subsequences in the order they appear.
5.  If at least one subsequence of `5`s is found:
    *   Identify the starting index and length of the *first* subsequence of `5`s.
    *   Replace the elements in the output sequence at that index and for that length with the value `key1`.
6.  If at least two subsequences of `5`s are found:
    *   Identify the starting index and length of the *second* subsequence of `5`s.
    *   Replace the elements in the output sequence at that index and for that length with the value `key2`.
7.  Return the modified output sequence.
