Task: Conditional Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray
      Length: 12
      Properties: Contains integers.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Length: 12
      Properties: Derived from InputSequence.
  - Key1:
      Type: int
      Source: InputSequence[0]
      Role: Potential first replacement value.
  - Key2:
      Type: int
      Source: InputSequence[1]
      Role: Potential second replacement value.
  - TargetValue:
      Type: int
      Value: 5
      Role: Value identifying runs for potential replacement.
  - CandidateRun:
      Type: Tuple[int, int] # (start_index, length)
      Properties: Represents a contiguous subsequence within InputSequence where all elements are TargetValue (5), and start_index >= 2.

Actions:
  - IdentifyKeys: Extract Key1 and Key2 from InputSequence[0] and InputSequence[1].
  - FindCandidateRuns: Locate all contiguous runs of TargetValue (5) within InputSequence, keeping only those whose start_index is 2 or greater. Record these runs in order of appearance.
  - ConditionalReplaceFirstRun:
      Condition: If at least one CandidateRun exists AND Key1 is not equal to TargetValue (5).
      Action: Modify the elements of the *first* identified CandidateRun in the OutputSequence to the value of Key1.
  - ConditionalReplaceSecondRun:
      Condition: If at least two CandidateRuns exist AND Key2 is not equal to TargetValue (5).
      Action: Modify the elements of the *second* identified CandidateRun in the OutputSequence to the value of Key2.
  - InitializeOutput: Create OutputSequence as a copy of InputSequence before replacements.

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is a transformation of InputSequence.
  - Key1 and Key2 determine the *potential* replacement values.
  - Replacement depends on both the existence of a CandidateRun (run of 5s starting at index >= 2) and whether the corresponding Key (Key1 for the first run, Key2 for the second run) is not equal to 5.
  - Only the first two CandidateRuns are considered for replacement. Subsequent runs are never modified.
