            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified across all examples is a `TypeError` indicating that the `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method on a `numpy.ndarray` object. This reveals a mismatch between the function's expectation (input as a string) and the actual data type being passed during testing (NumPy array). The core transformation logic (identifying runs of '5' and replacing the first two runs with the first two elements of the input) appears consistent with the examples provided in the initial prompt, but the implementation needs modification to handle the input as a numerical sequence (list or NumPy array) directly, rather than requiring string conversion and splitting. The strategy is to adjust the function signature and internal processing to work directly with the sequence data type.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe execution failed before any transformation logic could be applied due to the input type mismatch. Therefore, metrics related to the success or failure of the transformation itself cannot be gathered. However, we can confirm the structural elements based on the initial examples:\n\n*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (as indicated by the error message).\n*   **Input Shape:** Fixed-length sequence of 12 integers for all examples.\n*   **Output Type:** Expected to be a sequence (likely list or NumPy array) of 12 integers.\n*   **Key Values:**\n    *   train_1: `key1=5`, `key2=1`\n    *   train_2: `key1=6`, `key2=5`\n    *   train_3: `key1=4`, `key2=7`\n    *   train_4: `key1=9`, `key2=8`\n    *   train_5: `key1=4`, `key2=2`\n    *   train_6: `key1=4`, `key2=9`\n    *   train_7: `key1=3`, `key2=9`\n*   **Target Value:** The integer `5` is consistently the target for replacement.\n*   **Replacement Pattern:** The first run of `5`s is replaced by `key1`, the second run by `key2`.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
