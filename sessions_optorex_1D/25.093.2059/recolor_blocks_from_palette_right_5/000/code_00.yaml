Task: Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Length: 12
      Properties: Contains integers.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Length: 12
      Properties: Derived from InputSequence.
  - Key1:
      Type: int
      Source: InputSequence[0]
      Role: First replacement value.
  - Key2:
      Type: int
      Source: InputSequence[1]
      Role: Second replacement value.
  - TargetValue:
      Type: int
      Value: 5
      Role: Value to be replaced in sequences.
  - FiveSequence:
      Type: List[int]
      Properties: A contiguous subsequence within InputSequence where all elements are TargetValue (5).
      Occurrence: Can appear multiple times.

Actions:
  - IdentifyRuns: Locate all contiguous FiveSequences within the InputSequence.
  - ReplaceFirstRun: Modify the elements of the first identified FiveSequence to Key1.
  - ReplaceSecondRun: Modify the elements of the second identified FiveSequence to Key2.
  - CopyRemaining: All other elements from InputSequence are copied to OutputSequence without modification, including any FiveSequences found after the first two.

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence is a transformation of InputSequence.
  - The values used for replacement (Key1, Key2) are determined by the first two elements of the InputSequence.
  - The replacement action targets specific occurrences (first and second) of FiveSequences.
