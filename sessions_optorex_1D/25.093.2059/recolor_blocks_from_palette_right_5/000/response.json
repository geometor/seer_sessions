Let's designate the first integer (at index 0) as `key1` and the second integer (at index 1) as `key2`.\n3.  **Target Element:** The integer `5` is the primary target for modification within the sequence.\n4.  **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation involves identifying contiguous subsequences (runs) composed entirely of the integer `5`.\n5.  **Replacement Rule:** The *first* identified run of `5`s is replaced by a run of the same length, but using the value `key1`. The *second* identified run of `5`s is replaced by a run of the same length, but using the value `key2`. Any subsequent runs of `5`s are left unchanged. Other numbers in the sequence remain in their original positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
