"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 integers based on the following rules:
1. Read the input as a single string containing 12 space-separated integers.
2. Parse the input string into a sequence (list) of 12 integers.
3. Identify the first integer in the sequence as key1 and the second integer as key2. The target value for replacement is 5.
4. Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
5. Scan the input sequence, starting from the *third* element (index 2) to the end, to find all contiguous subsequences (runs) consisting solely of the target value 5. Record the starting index (relative to the original sequence) and length of each run found, in the order they appear.
6. Check if key1 is *not* equal to 5. If it is not, AND if at least one run of 5s was found in step 5:
    * Locate the elements in the output sequence corresponding to the *first* run found in step 5 (using its recorded start index and length).
    * Replace these elements with the value key1.
7. Check if key2 is *not* equal to 5. If it is not, AND if at least *two* runs of 5s were found in step 5:
    * Locate the elements in the output sequence corresponding to the *second* run found in step 5 (using its recorded start index and length).
    * Replace these elements with the value key2.
8. Convert the potentially modified output sequence back into a string of 12 space-separated integers.
9. Return the resulting string.
