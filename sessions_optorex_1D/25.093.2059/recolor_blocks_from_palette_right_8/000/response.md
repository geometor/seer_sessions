Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
2.  **Key Number '5':** The number `5` in the input seems to be the primary target for transformation. Other numbers often remain unchanged in their positions, especially zeros and the initial non-zero numbers.
3.  **Role of Non-Zero Numbers:** The non-zero numbers present in the input sequence appear to determine the replacement values for the `5`s. Their original order matters.
4.  **Block Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to happen on individual `5`s independently, but rather on contiguous blocks (sequences) of `5`s.
5.  **Replacement Pattern:** Each block of `5`s is replaced entirely by a single value. This replacement value is taken sequentially from the list of non-zero numbers found in the original input. The first block of `5`s uses the first non-zero number, the second block uses the second non-zero number, and so on. If there are more blocks of `5`s than non-zero numbers, the sequence of non-zero numbers likely cycles (though not explicitly shown in these examples, it's a reasonable inference).

**Fact Sheet:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: The initial sequence of integers provided.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: The resulting sequence after applying the transformation rule. It has the same length as the input_sequence.
  - name: non_zero_numbers
    type: list[int]
    description: An ordered list containing all non-zero integers extracted from the input_sequence, preserving their original relative order.
  - name: five_blocks
    type: list[tuple[int, int]]
    description: A list identifying the start and end indices (inclusive) of contiguous blocks of the number 5 within the input_sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    value: int
  - object: input_sequence/output_sequence
    property: elements
    value: int (0-9)

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_numbers
    description: Iterate through the input_sequence and collect all numbers not equal to 0 into a new list, maintaining their order.
  - name: identify_five_blocks
    input: input_sequence
    output: five_blocks
    description: Scan the input_sequence to find consecutive sequences composed solely of the number 5, recording the start and end index of each block.
  - name: replace_blocks
    inputs:
      - input_sequence (implicitly used for structure and non-5 values)
      - five_blocks
      - non_zero_numbers
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a copy of the input_sequence. Iterate through the identified five_blocks. For the k-th block (0-indexed), replace all elements within its range in the copied sequence with the value from non_zero_numbers at index (k % length(non_zero_numbers)).

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    source: k-th element of five_blocks
    target: (k % length(non_zero_numbers))-th element of non_zero_numbers
    description: The value used to replace a specific block of 5s is determined by its order of appearance and the ordered list of non-zero numbers from the input.
  - type: preservation
    elements: Numbers in input_sequence not equal to 5
    condition: These numbers retain their original values and positions in the output_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the `output_sequence` as a copy of the `input_sequence`.
2.  Create an ordered list called `non_zero_numbers` by extracting all non-zero integers from the `input_sequence`, preserving their original relative order. If `non_zero_numbers` is empty, no replacements occur.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of the number `5` within the `input_sequence`. Record the start and end index for each block. Store these blocks in a list called `five_blocks`, ordered by their starting index.
4.  Initialize a counter `block_index` to 0.
5.  Iterate through each `block` (defined by a start and end index) in the `five_blocks` list.
6.  For the current `block`:
    a.  Determine the replacement value by taking the element from `non_zero_numbers` at index (`block_index` modulo the length of `non_zero_numbers`).
    b.  Iterate through all indices from the `block`'s start index to its end index (inclusive).
    c.  For each index within this range, update the value in the `output_sequence` at that index to the determined replacement value.
    d.  Increment the `block_index` by 1.
7.  Return the modified `output_sequence`.
