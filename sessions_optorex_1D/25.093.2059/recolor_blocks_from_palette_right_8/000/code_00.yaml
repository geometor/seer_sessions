objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: The initial sequence of integers provided.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list[int]
    description: The resulting sequence after applying the transformation rule. It has the same length as the input_sequence.
  - name: non_zero_numbers
    type: list[int]
    description: An ordered list containing all non-zero integers extracted from the input_sequence, preserving their original relative order.
  - name: five_blocks
    type: list[tuple[int, int]]
    description: A list identifying the start and end indices (inclusive) of contiguous blocks of the number 5 within the input_sequence.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    value: int
  - object: input_sequence/output_sequence
    property: elements
    value: int (0-9)
  - object: five_blocks
    property: count
    value: int
  - object: non_zero_numbers
    property: count
    value: int

actions:
  - name: extract_non_zeros
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_numbers
    description: Iterate through the input_sequence and collect all numbers not equal to 0 into a new list, maintaining their order.
  - name: identify_five_blocks
    input: input_sequence
    output: five_blocks
    description: Scan the input_sequence to find consecutive sequences composed solely of the number 5, recording the start and end index of each block.
  - name: replace_blocks
    inputs:
      - input_sequence (implicitly used for structure and non-5 values)
      - five_blocks
      - non_zero_numbers
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a copy of the input_sequence. Iterate through the identified five_blocks. For the k-th block (0-indexed), replace all elements within its range in the copied sequence with the value from non_zero_numbers at index (k % length(non_zero_numbers)).

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    source: k-th element of five_blocks
    target: (k % length(non_zero_numbers))-th element of non_zero_numbers
    description: The value used to replace a specific block of 5s is determined by its order of appearance and the ordered list of non-zero numbers from the input.
  - type: preservation
    elements: Numbers in input_sequence not equal to 5
    condition: These numbers retain their original values and positions in the output_sequence.
