            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.\n2.  **Key Number '5':** The number `5` in the input seems to be the primary target for transformation. Other numbers often remain unchanged in their positions, especially zeros and the initial non-zero numbers.\n3.  **Role of Non-Zero Numbers:** The non-zero numbers present in the input sequence appear to determine the replacement values for the `5`s. Their original order matters.\n4.  **Block Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to happen on individual `5`s independently, but rather on contiguous blocks (sequences) of `5`s.\n5.  **Replacement Pattern:** Each block of `5`s is replaced entirely by a single value. This replacement value is taken sequentially from the list of non-zero numbers found in the original input. The first block of `5`s uses the first non-zero number, the second block uses the second non-zero number, and so on. If there are more blocks of `5`s than non-zero numbers, the sequence of non-zero numbers likely cycles (though not explicitly shown in these examples, it's a reasonable inference).\n\n**Fact Sheet:**\n\n"
