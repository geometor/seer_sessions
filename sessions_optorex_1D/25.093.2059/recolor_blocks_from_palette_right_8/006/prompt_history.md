Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
2.  **Key Number '5':** The number `5` in the input seems to be the primary target for transformation. Other numbers often remain unchanged in their positions, especially zeros and the initial non-zero numbers.
3.  **Role of Non-Zero Numbers:** The non-zero numbers present in the input sequence appear to determine the replacement values for the `5`s. Their original order matters.
4.  **Block Transformation:** The transformation doesn't seem to happen on individual `5`s independently, but rather on contiguous blocks (sequences) of `5`s.
5.  **Replacement Pattern:** Each block of `5`s is replaced entirely by a single value. This replacement value is taken sequentially from the list of non-zero numbers found in the original input. The first block of `5`s uses the first non-zero number, the second block uses the second non-zero number, and so on. If there are more blocks of `5`s than non-zero numbers, the sequence of non-zero numbers likely cycles (though not explicitly shown in these examples, it's a reasonable inference).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the `output_sequence` as a copy of the `input_sequence`.
2.  Create an ordered list called `non_zero_numbers` by extracting all non-zero integers from the `input_sequence`, preserving their original relative order. If `non_zero_numbers` is empty, no replacements occur.
3.  Identify all contiguous blocks of the number `5` within the `input_sequence`. Record the start and end index for each block. Store these blocks in a list called `five_blocks`, ordered by their starting index.
4.  Initialize a counter `block_index` to 0.
5.  Iterate through each `block` (defined by a start and end index) in the `five_blocks` list.
6.  For the current `block`:
    a.  Determine the replacement value by taking the element from `non_zero_numbers` at index (`block_index` modulo the length of `non_zero_numbers`).
    b.  Iterate through all indices from the `block`'s start index to its end index (inclusive).
    c.  For each index within this range, update the value in the `output_sequence` at that index to the determined replacement value.
    d.  Increment the `block_index` by 1.
7.  Return the modified `output_sequence`.
