## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt failed because the code assumed standard Python lists, while the execution environment seems to be using NumPy arrays. The error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" indicates that boolean comparisons intended for single elements were applied to entire arrays implicitly, which is not allowed in NumPy without explicit methods like `.any()` or `.all()`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Data Type:** Assume inputs are NumPy arrays and verify this assumption.
2.  **Adapt Code for NumPy:** Modify the helper functions (`extract_non_zeros`, `identify_five_blocks`) and the main `transform` function to work correctly with NumPy arrays, using appropriate indexing and element-wise operations.
3.  **Verify Logic:** Re-test the core logic (extracting non-zeros, identifying blocks of 5s, sequential replacement) against the examples using the adapted code.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML fact sheet and natural language program to reflect the use of NumPy arrays and any logic adjustments.

## Metrics Gathering

We will analyze `train_1` and `train_2` to confirm the data type and verify the extraction/identification logic.


``` python
import numpy as np

# --- Example train_1 ---
input_1_str = "3 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0"
output_1_str = "3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0"

input_1 = np.array([int(x) for x in input_1_str.split()])
output_1 = np.array([int(x) for x in output_1_str.split()])

# --- Example train_2 ---

output_2_str = "2 7 0 2 2 0 0 0 7 7 0 0"

input_2 = np.array([int(x) for x in input_2_str.split()])
output_2 = np.array([int(x) for x in output_2_str.split()])

**Observations from Metrics:**

1.  **Input Type:** The inputs are indeed NumPy arrays (`<class 'numpy.ndarray'>`).
2.  **Non-Zero Extraction:** The `extract_non_zeros_np` function using NumPy boolean indexing `sequence[sequence != 0]` works correctly for identifying non-zero elements *but* it also includes the `5`s themselves. The rule requires extracting the *non-zero, non-five* numbers as the replacement pool. This needs correction. Let's redefine the source of replacement values. Looking closely at the examples:
    *   `train_1`: `[3 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0]` -> `[3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0]`. The `5`s are replaced by `3`. `3` is the only non-zero, non-five number.
    *   `train_2`: `[2 7 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0]` -> `[2 7 0 2 2 0 0 0 7 7 0 0]`. The first block `[5 5]` is replaced by `2`. The second block `[5 5]` is replaced by `7`. `2` and `7` are the non-zero, non-five numbers in order.
    *   `train_3`: `[9 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0]` -> `[9 5 0 9 9 0 5 5 0 0 0 0]`. First block `[5 5]` replaced by `9`. Second block `[5 5]` replaced by `5`. Wait, the second block is replaced by `5`, which *is* one of the non-zero numbers but wasn't explicitly non-five. Let's re-examine. Ah, the non-zero numbers are `9, 5`. First block gets `9`. Second block gets `5`. It seems the *original non-zero numbers* are used, including `5`s *if they were not part of a block being replaced*.
    *   Let's re-re-examine `train_1`: Non-zeros are `3, 5, 5, 5, 5`. Only one block `(5, 8)`. Use first non-zero: `3`. Output `[... 3 3 3 3 ...]`. Correct.
    *   `train_2`: Non-zeros are `2, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5`. Blocks `(3, 4)` and `(8, 9)`. First block gets first non-zero `2`. Second block gets second non-zero `7`. Output `[... 2 2 ... 7 7 ...]`. Correct.
    *   `train_3`: Non-zeros are `9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5`. Blocks `(3, 4)` and `(6, 7)`. First block gets first non-zero `9`. Second block gets second non-zero `5`. Output `[... 9 9 ... 5 5 ...]`. Correct.
    *   `train_6`: `[2 8 9 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0]`. Non-zeros: `2, 8, 9, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5`. Blocks: `(3, 4)`, `(6, 7)`, `(9, 10)`. First block gets `2`. Second block gets `8`. Third block gets `9`. Output `[... 2 2 ... 8 8 ... 9 9 ...]`. Correct.

    **Revised Understanding:** The replacement values are taken sequentially from the list of *all* non-zero numbers present in the original input array, in the order they appear.
3.  **Block Identification:** The `identify_five_blocks_np` function correctly identifies the start and end indices of contiguous blocks of `5`s.

For the k-th block (0-indexed), replace all elements within its index range [start, end] in the copied array with the value from replacement_values at index (k % length(replacement_values)). If replacement_values is empty, no replacement occurs.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    source: k-th element of five_blocks
    target: (k % length(replacement_values))-th element of replacement_values
    description: The value used to replace a specific block of 5s is determined cyclically by its order of appearance and the ordered list of non-zero numbers from the input.

    condition: These numbers generally retain their original values and positions in the output_array, unless they are part of the replacement_values list and are used to overwrite a block of 5s elsewhere. The fundamental preservation is for elements that are *not* part of an identified five_block.
```


## Natural Language Program (Revised)

1.  Create an array called `replacement_values` by extracting all non-zero elements from the `input_array`, preserving their original relative order.
2.  Identify all contiguous blocks composed solely of the number `5` within the `input_array`. For each block, record its start and end index (inclusive). Store these blocks (as start/end index pairs) in an ordered list called `five_blocks`.
3.  Initialize the `output_array` as a copy of the `input_array`.
4.  If the `replacement_values` array is empty or the `five_blocks` list is empty, return the `output_array` without modification.
5.  Get the number of available replacement values, `num_replacements = length(replacement_values)`.
6.  Iterate through the `five_blocks` list using an index `block_index` (starting from 0). For each `block` defined by `(start_index, end_index)`:
    a.  Determine the `current_replacement_value` by selecting the element from `replacement_values` at index (`block_index` modulo `num_replacements`).
    b.  For every index `i` from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive), set the element in `output_array` at index `i` to the `current_replacement_value`.
7.  Return the modified `output_array`.
