objects:
  - name: input_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: The initial 1D NumPy array of integers.
  - name: output_array
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: The resulting 1D NumPy array after transformation, with the same shape as the input_array.
  - name: replacement_values
    type: numpy.ndarray
    description: A 1D NumPy array containing all non-zero integers extracted from the input_array, preserving their original relative order. These values are used cyclically to replace blocks of 5s.
  - name: five_blocks
    type: list[tuple[int, int]]
    description: A list identifying the start and end indices (inclusive) of contiguous blocks of the number 5 within the input_array, ordered by start index.

properties:
  - object: input_array/output_array
    property: shape
    value: tuple (e.g., (12,))
  - object: input_array/output_array
    property: elements
    value: int (0-9)
  - object: five_blocks
    property: count
    value: int
  - object: replacement_values
    property: count
    value: int

actions:
  - name: extract_replacement_values
    input: input_array
    output: replacement_values
    description: Create a new NumPy array containing all elements from input_array that are not equal to 0, maintaining their original relative order.
  - name: identify_five_blocks
    input: input_array
    output: five_blocks
    description: Scan the input_array to find consecutive sequences composed solely of the number 5, recording the start and end index (inclusive) of each block.
  - name: replace_blocks
    inputs:
      - input_array
      - five_blocks
      - replacement_values
    output: output_array
    description: Create a copy of the input_array. Iterate through the identified five_blocks. For the k-th block (0-indexed), replace all elements within its index range [start, end] in the copied array with the value from replacement_values at index (k % length(replacement_values)). If replacement_values is empty, no replacement occurs.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    source: k-th element of five_blocks
    target: (k % length(replacement_values))-th element of replacement_values
    description: The value used to replace a specific block of 5s is determined cyclically by its order of appearance and the ordered list of non-zero numbers from the input.
  - type: preservation
    elements: Elements in input_array not equal to 5
    condition: These numbers generally retain their original values and positions in the output_array, unless they are part of the replacement_values list and are used to overwrite a block of 5s elsewhere. The fundamental preservation is for elements that are *not* part of an identified five_block.
