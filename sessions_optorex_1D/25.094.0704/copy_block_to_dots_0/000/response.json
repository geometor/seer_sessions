            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.\n*   **Key Values:** The digits `0` and non-zero digits (e.g., `1`, `6`, `9`) play distinct roles.\n*   **Structure:** The sequences appear to have a fixed length (12 in the examples).\n*   **Core Pattern:** The transformation seems to focus on isolated non-zero digits in the input. An \"isolated\" non-zero digit `N` appears to be one that is surrounded by zeros (pattern `0 N 0`).\n*   **Action:** When an isolated non-zero digit `N` (pattern `0 N 0`) is found in the input, this triplet is replaced by `N N N` in the output sequence at the corresponding positions.\n*   **Inertia:** Digits that are not part of an isolated `0 N 0` pattern in the input seem to be copied directly to the output. This includes initial sequences like `6 6 6` and zeros not involved in the transformation.\n*   **Simultaneity:** The transformation appears to identify all `0 N 0` patterns in the *original* input and applies the changes simultaneously to create the output. Changes do not cascade or depend on intermediate results within a single transformation step.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"

Create a new sequence, designated as the `output`, having the same length as the `input` sequence and initially containing a copy of the `input` sequence's elements.\n2.  Iterate through the `input` sequence, examining each element from the second position up to, but not including, the last position. Let the current position be `i`.\n3.  At each position `i`, retrieve the value `N = input[i]`.\n4.  Check if the following three conditions are all true based on the `input` sequence:\n    a.  The value `N` at position `i` is not zero (`input[i] != 0`).\n    b.  The value at the preceding position `i-1` is zero (`input[i-1] == 0`).\n    c.  The value at the following position `i+1` is zero (`input[i+1] == 0`).\n5.  If all three conditions are met, update the `output` sequence by setting the values at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all equal to `N`.\n6.  After checking all relevant positions in the `input` sequence, the final `output` sequence represents the result of the transformation."
