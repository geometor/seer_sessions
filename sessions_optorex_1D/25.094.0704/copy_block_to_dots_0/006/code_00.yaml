patterns:
  - name: isolated_non_zero
    description: A non-zero digit surrounded by zeros.
    structure: [zero_digit, non_zero_digit(N), zero_digit]
    location: input_sequence (indices i-1, i, i+1)
    condition: input[i-1] == 0 and input[i] == N != 0 and input[i+1] == 0
actions:
  - name: expand_isolated_non_zero
    trigger: detection of isolated_non_zero pattern (0 N 0) centered at index 'i' in the *original* input sequence.
    effect: modify a copy of the input sequence to create the output sequence.
    details: set output[i-1]=N, output[i]=N, output[i+1]=N for each detected pattern.
  - name: copy_element
    trigger: element at index 'j' in input is not part of a transformation triggered by an isolated_non_zero pattern.
    effect: retain the original value in the output sequence.
    details: output[j] = input[j] (implicitly handled by initializing output as a copy and only modifying triggered triplets).
relationships:
  - type: state_dependence
    description: The transformation rule applies based solely on the configuration of the original input sequence. Changes are determined simultaneously before being applied.
  - type: locality
    description: The transformation rule depends on local neighborhoods (triplets) within the sequence.
