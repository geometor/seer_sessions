Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
*   **Key Values:** The digits `0` and non-zero digits (e.g., `1`, `6`, `9`) play distinct roles.
*   **Structure:** The sequences appear to have a fixed length (12 in the examples).
*   **Core Pattern:** The transformation seems to focus on isolated non-zero digits in the input. An "isolated" non-zero digit `N` appears to be one that is surrounded by zeros (pattern `0 N 0`).
*   **Action:** When an isolated non-zero digit `N` (pattern `0 N 0`) is found in the input, this triplet is replaced by `N N N` in the output sequence at the corresponding positions.
*   **Inertia:** Digits that are not part of an isolated `0 N 0` pattern in the input seem to be copied directly to the output. This includes initial sequences like `6 6 6` and zeros not involved in the transformation.
*   **Simultaneity:** The transformation appears to identify all `0 N 0` patterns in the *original* input and applies the changes simultaneously to create the output. Changes do not cascade or depend on intermediate results within a single transformation step.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new sequence, designated as the `output`, having the same length as the `input` sequence and initially containing a copy of the `input` sequence's elements.
2.  Iterate through the `input` sequence, examining each element from the second position up to, but not including, the last position. Let the current position be `i`.
3.  At each position `i`, retrieve the value `N = input[i]`.
4.  Check if the following three conditions are all true based on the `input` sequence:
    a.  The value `N` at position `i` is not zero (`input[i] != 0`).
    b.  The value at the preceding position `i-1` is zero (`input[i-1] == 0`).
    c.  The value at the following position `i+1` is zero (`input[i+1] == 0`).
5.  If all three conditions are met, update the `output` sequence by setting the values at positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` all equal to `N`.
6.  After checking all relevant positions in the `input` sequence, the final `output` sequence represents the result of the transformation.
```python

import re # Using re to easily parse the input string

"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers based on a local pattern.
Specifically, it identifies isolated non-zero digits 'N' in the input, 
defined as a pattern '0 N 0' (where N > 0). For each such identified 
pattern centered at index 'i' in the input, the corresponding elements 
at indices 'i-1', 'i', and 'i+1' in the output sequence are all set to 'N'. 
Elements in the input sequence not part of such a '0 N 0' trigger pattern 
are copied directly to their corresponding positions in the output sequence.
The pattern matching is based solely on the original input, and changes 
are applied simultaneously to form the output.
