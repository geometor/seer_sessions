task: sequence_transformation
input_object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  representation: list_of_integers
  properties:
    - target_number_N: The value of the element at index 0.
    - initial_pattern: The first three elements are equal to N.
    - contains_N_later: Contains at least one occurrence of N at an index >= 3.
output_object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  representation: list_of_integers
  properties:
    - same_length_as_input
    - derived_from_input
transformation:
  action: modify_sequence
  steps:
    - identify_target: Determine the target number N from the first element (index 0) of the input sequence.
    - locate_trigger: Find the index 'i' of the *first* occurrence of N in the input sequence, searching only from index 3 onwards.
    - modify_elements: Create a copy of the input sequence. In the copy, set the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 to the value N.
  output_derivation: The modified copy is the output sequence.
