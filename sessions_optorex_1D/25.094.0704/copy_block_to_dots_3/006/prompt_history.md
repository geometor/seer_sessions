*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
    *   The first number in the sequence seems significant, appearing three times initially and acting as a 'target' value. Let's call this target value `N`.
    *   The core transformation involves finding the first occurrence of `N` *after* the initial three `N`s.
    *   A specific subsequence of three elements in the input, centered around this found `N`, is replaced by `N N N` to produce the output.

*   **Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input sequence of numbers.
    2.  Determine the target number `N` by taking the first number in the sequence.
    3.  Find the index `i` of the first occurrence of `N` in the sequence, searching only from the fourth position (index 3) onwards.
    4.  Modify the sequence by replacing the number at index `i-1` with `N`, the number at index `i` with `N`, and the number at index `i+1` with `N`.
    5.  Output the modified sequence.
