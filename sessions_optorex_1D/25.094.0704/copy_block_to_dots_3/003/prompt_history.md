*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
    *   The first number in the sequence seems significant, appearing three times initially and acting as a 'target' value. Let's call this target value `N`.
    *   The core transformation involves finding the first occurrence of `N` *after* the initial three `N`s.
    *   A specific subsequence of three elements in the input, centered around this found `N`, is replaced by `N N N` to produce the output.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The primary issue identified is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The `transform` function was designed to process a space-separated string, but the testing environment provided NumPy arrays, leading to the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`.
    *   The core transformation logic (identifying the target number `N` from the first element, finding the first occurrence of `N` after index 2, and replacing the surrounding elements `[i-1, i, i+1]` with `[N, N, N]`) appears consistent across all examples based on a manual check of the input/output pairs presented.
    *   The strategy is to:
        1.  Modify the function signature and internal processing to accept a NumPy array (or a standard Python list, which NumPy arrays can often be treated as for basic indexing and iteration).
        2.  Remove the string splitting logic.
        3.  Adjust the output format. The function currently returns a formatted string. Given the input is likely an array, the output should probably be a list of integers or a NumPy array. We will target returning a list of integers.
        4.  Verify the transformation logic remains correct with the adjusted input/output handling.

*   **Metrics and Observations:**
    *   We'll use `tool_code` to represent the input/output pairs as lists and verify the core logic.

*   **Findings from Metrics:**
    *   The analysis confirms that for every example, the transformation rule holds:
        *   Input and output lists have the same length.
        *   The target number `N` is the first element.
        *   The first three elements are always `N`.
        *   There is always an `N` found at an index `i` greater than 2.
        *   The indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are always within the list bounds in the given examples.
        *   The values in the input list at indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` are consistently `[0, N, 0]`.
        *   The values in the output list at indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` are consistently `[N, N, N]`.
        *   Reconstructing the output by applying the rule to the input yields the correct expected output list for all examples.
    *   The core logic is sound; the failure was purely due to the input/output type mismatch in the previous code execution environment.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**

    4.  Search the input list starting from the fourth element (index 3) to find the index `i` of the *first* occurrence of the target number `N`.
    5.  If such an index `i` is found:
        *   Modify the output list by setting the value at index `i-1` to `N`.
        *   Modify the output list by setting the value at index `i` to `N`.
        *   Modify the output list by setting the value at index `i+1` to `N`.
    6.  Return the modified list as the output.
