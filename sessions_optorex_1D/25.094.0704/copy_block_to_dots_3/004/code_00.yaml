task: sequence_transformation
input_object:
  type: list_of_integers
  structure: linear_sequence
  representation: space-separated_string in examples, list_of_int in processing
  properties:
    - contains_target_number_N: N is defined by the value of the first element (index 0).
    - initial_pattern: The first three elements are always equal to N.
    - variable_length: The length of the sequence can vary (though all examples have length 12).
    - contains_trigger: Contains at least one occurrence of N at an index greater than 2.

output_object:
  type: list_of_integers
  structure: linear_sequence
  representation: space-separated_string in examples, list_of_int in processing
  properties:
    - same_length_as_input: The length remains unchanged.
    - derived_from_input: It's a modified version of the input sequence.

transformation_rule:
  action: modify_subsequence
  target_number: N (value of input_object[0])
  trigger:
    condition: Find the first element in the input_object with value N at an index `i` such that `i >= 3`.
    found_index: `i`
  modification:
    operation: replace_values
    target_indices: [`i-1`, `i`, `i+1`] (relative to the found_index `i`)
    new_value: N
    context: Creates a copy of the input_object and applies the modifications to this copy.
  output_generation: The modified copy becomes the output_object.

validation_notes:
  - Initial code execution failed, likely due to implementation error.
  - Simulation confirms the transformation rule matches all input/expected output pairs.
  - Assumes found_index `i` will always be such that `i > 0` and `i < length - 1`, based on examples.
