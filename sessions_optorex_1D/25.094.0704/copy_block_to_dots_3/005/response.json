Identifies the target number, N, which is the value of the first element (at index 0) in the input sequence.\n3. Searches the input sequence, starting from the fourth element (index 3), to find the index 'i' of the *first* occurrence of the target number N.\n4. If such an index 'i' is found:\n    a. Modifies the *copy* of the sequence: sets the value at index i-1 to N.\n    b. Modifies the *copy* of the sequence: sets the value at index i to N.\n    c.
