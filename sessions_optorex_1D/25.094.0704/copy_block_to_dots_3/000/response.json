Let's call this target value `N`.\n    *   The core transformation involves finding the first occurrence of `N` *after* the initial three `N`s.\n    *   A specific subsequence of three elements in the input, centered around this found `N`, is replaced by `N N N` to produce the output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
