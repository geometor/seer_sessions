Transformation Rule Natural Language Program:

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new sequence, `output_sequence`, initially containing an exact copy of the input sequence.
3.  Identify the `key_digit` by taking the value of the first element (at index 0) from the *original input sequence*.
4.  Create an empty list called `trigger_indices`.
5.  Iterate through the *original input sequence* using an index `i`, starting from `i = 3` and going up to `i = length - 2` (inclusive, which is index 10 for a length-12 sequence).
6.  Inside the loop, if the value of the element at index `i` in the *original input sequence* is equal to the `key_digit`, add the index `i` to the `trigger_indices` list.
7.  After the loop finishes, iterate through each index `i` stored in the `trigger_indices` list.
8.  For each `i` in `trigger_indices`, modify the `output_sequence` by setting the values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to the `key_digit`.
9.  Return the final `output_sequence`.
