    properties:
      length: 12
      content: integers (non-negative)
      structure: linear list/array
  - type: sequence
    description: Output is a sequence of 12 integers derived from the input.
    properties:
      length: 12
      content: integers (non-negative)
      structure: linear list/array

key_objects:
  - object: key_digit
    description: The non-zero integer found in the first three positions of the input sequence.
    source: input[0]
  - object: original_input_sequence
    description: The unmodified input sequence used for scanning.
  - object: output_sequence
    description: A modifiable copy of the input sequence, initialized identically to the input.
  - object: trigger_location
    description: An index `i` in the original_input_sequence such that `i >= 3` and `i <= length - 2`, and `original_input_sequence[i]` equals the `key_digit`.
  - object: modification_triplet
    description: A sequence of three indices `[i-1, i, i+1]` in the `output_sequence` targeted for modification.
    trigger: A `trigger_location` at index `i`.

actions:
  - action: initialize_output
    actor: system
    input: original_input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    description: Create a distinct copy of the original_input_sequence.
  - action: identify_key
    actor: system
    input: original_input_sequence
    output: key_digit
    description: Extract the value from the first element (index 0).
  - action: scan_for_triggers
    actor: system
    input: original_input_sequence, key_digit
    output: list_of_trigger_locations
    description: Iterate through the original_input_sequence from index 3 to `length - 2` (inclusive). Collect all indices `i` where the element equals the key_digit.
  - action: apply_modifications
    actor: system
    input: output_sequence, key_digit, list_of_trigger_locations
    output: modified_output_sequence
    description: For each trigger_location index `i` found in the previous step, set the values at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output_sequence to the key_digit.

relationships:
  - relationship: copy_modify
    subject: original_input_sequence
    object: output_sequence
    description: The output sequence starts as a copy of the input, and modifications are applied only to the output sequence.
  - relationship: trigger_condition
    subject: element value at index `i` in original_input_sequence (where 3 <= i <= length-2)
    object: key_digit
    description: An element matching the key_digit at a valid index `i` defines a trigger_location.
  - relationship: modification_rule
    subject: trigger_location at index `i`
    object: modification_triplet `[i-1, i, i+1]` in output_sequence
    description: Each trigger_location `i` mandates setting the corresponding triplet in the output_sequence to the key_digit.
