            "text": "*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**\n    *   The core transformation logic identified previously appears correct based on a manual re-check of the examples. The logic involves identifying a 'key' digit from the start of the sequence and then, for every occurrence of this key digit after the first three positions in the *original* input, replacing a triplet of elements (centered at the occurrence) in a *copy* of the input with the key digit.\n    *   The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` indicates that the testing framework passed the input as a NumPy array, whereas the previous code expected a space-separated string and included parsing/formatting steps.\n    *   The strategy is to refine the understanding and description to treat the input and output directly as sequences (like lists or arrays) of integers, removing the unnecessary string parsing/formatting steps. The fundamental algorithm for the transformation remains the same.\n\n*   **Metrics and Observations:**\n    *   **Input/Output Format:** All examples use sequences of 12 integers. The error confirms the test harness uses NumPy arrays, aligning with the interpretation of the data as numerical sequences rather than strings.\n    *   **Key Digit:** In all examples, the first three elements are identical and non-zero. This digit (`input[0]`) acts as the 'key'.\n    *   **Trigger Condition:** The transformation is triggered by finding the `key_digit` at an index `i > 2`.\n    *   **Action:** When a `key_digit` is found at index `i` (where `i > 2`) in the original input, the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output sequence are set to `key_digit`.\n    *   **Multiple Triggers:** Examples 3 and 6 show multiple occurrences of the `key_digit`. The analysis confirms that all trigger locations should be identified based on the *original input* before modifications are applied to the output copy. This prevents one modification from affecting the detection of subsequent triggers.\n    *   **Index Boundaries:** The replacements occur at `i-1, i, i+1`. The examples show triggers at indices like 5, 6, 7, 9. The latest trigger index observed is 9, affecting indices 8, 9, 10. This stays within the bounds of the 12-element sequence (indices 0-11). The loop checking for triggers should scan indices from 3 up to 11 (`len(input) - 1`), but the replacement logic implicitly requires `i+1 < len(input)`, meaning the effective maximum trigger index `i` is `len(input) - 2` (index 10 in this case).\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

So, iterate `i` from 3 to 10 inclusive. Let's re-examine the examples. The logic `output[i-1], output[i], output[i+1] = key, key, key` implies `i` must be at least 1 and at most `len-2`. The scanning starts from index 3. So the loop for `i` should be from `max(3, 1)` to `min(len-1, len-2)`, which simplifies to `i` from 3 to `len-2` (index 10 for length 12).\n    6.
