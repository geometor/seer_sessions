Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Receive the input as a sequence (list/array) of 12 integers.
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence, called the output sequence.
3.  Identify the 'key digit' from the first element (`input[0]`) of the original input sequence.
4.  Create an empty list to store the indices of 'trigger locations'.
5.  Iterate through the original input sequence from the 4th element (index 3) up to the second-to-last element (index 10), as the modification requires access to index `i+1`.
6.  For each element at index `i` in the *original input sequence* within this range (3 to 10 inclusive):
    a.  If the element `input[i]` is equal to the 'key digit', add the index `i` to the list of trigger locations.
7.  After scanning the entire relevant portion of the input sequence, iterate through the collected list of trigger location indices (`i`).
8.  For each trigger index `i` in the list:
    a.  Modify the *output sequence* by setting the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` to the 'key digit'.
9.  Return the final modified output sequence.
