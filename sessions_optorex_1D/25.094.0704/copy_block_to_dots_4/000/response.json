This digit appears to be a 'key' or 'marker' digit for the transformation.\n    *   The transformation involves locating instances of this key digit *after* the initial three positions.\n    *   Each located key digit triggers a modification in its local neighborhood. Specifically, the digit itself and its immediate left and right neighbors are replaced by three instances of the key digit.\n    *   The replacement sequence `k k k` (where `k` is the key digit) seems to overwrite the positions `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`, where `i` is the index of the found key digit.\n    *   The initial three key digits are never modified.\n    *   The transformation operates on a copy of the input; finding the key digits should be done on the original input, while modifications are applied progressively to form the output.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
