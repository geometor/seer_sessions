*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
    *   The sequences contain zeros (0) and one other dominant non-zero digit (e.g., 8, 9, 2, 7).
    *   The transformation involves changing some of the zeros (0) to the dominant non-zero digit based on their position relative to existing non-zero digits.
    *   Specifically, if a non-zero digit `X` is found at position `i`, and its neighbors at `i-1` and `i+1` are both zeros (`0 X 0`), then those zeros are changed to `X` in the output, resulting in the pattern `X X X`.
    *   This replacement happens for all occurrences of the `0 X 0` pattern within the sequence.
    *   Digits that are not part of a `0 X 0` pattern remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**
    
```yaml
    objects:
      - sequence:
          description: A list of integers.
          properties:
            - elements: The integers in the sequence.
            - length: The number of elements.
      - element:
          description: An integer within the sequence.
          properties:
            - value: The integer digit (0-9).
            - position: The index within the sequence.
            - is_zero: Boolean indicating if the value is 0.
            - is_non_zero: Boolean indicating if the value is not 0.
    relationships:
      - adjacent: An element at position `i` has neighbors at `i-1` (left) and `i+1` (right), if they exist within the sequence bounds.
      - surrounded_by_zeros: A non-zero element `X` at position `i` is surrounded by zeros if the element at `i-1` is 0 and the element at `i+1` is 0.
    actions:
      - identify_pattern: Locate all instances within the input sequence where a non-zero element `X` is directly preceded and followed by a zero element (the pattern `0 X 0`).
      - replace_zeros: For each identified pattern `0 X 0` centered at index `i`, modify the elements at indices `i-1` and `i+1` in the output sequence to have the value `X`.
      - copy_unmodified: Elements not involved in the identified `0 X 0` pattern are copied directly from the input to the output sequence at the same position.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the basis for the output sequence.
    2.  Iterate through the input sequence from the second element (index 1) up to the second-to-last element (index `length - 2`).
    3.  For each element at index `i`:
        a.  Check if the element at index `i` in the *input* sequence is non-zero (let its value be `X`).
        b.  Check if the element at index `i-1` in the *input* sequence is zero.
        c.  Check if the element at index `i+1` in the *input* sequence is zero.
        d.  If all three conditions (a, b, c) are true (i.e., the pattern `0 X 0` exists in the input sequence centered at `i`), then update the elements at indices `i-1` and `i+1` in the *output* sequence to the value `X`.
    4.  Return the modified output sequence.
