objects:
  - sequence:
      description: A 1-dimensional list/array of single-digit integers.
      properties:
        - elements: The integers in the sequence (e.g., 0, 2, 7, 8, 9).
        - length: The number of elements in the sequence. Remains constant during transformation.
  - element:
      description: An integer at a specific position within the sequence.
      properties:
        - value: The integer digit.
        - position: The index (0-based) within the sequence.
        - type: Can be zero (0) or non-zero (X > 0).
  - pattern:
      description: A specific arrangement of three adjacent elements.
      properties:
        - type: '0 X 0' - A non-zero element 'X' at index 'i' preceded by a zero at 'i-1' and followed by a zero at 'i+1'.
relationships:
  - adjacency: Elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are adjacent. Requires `1 <= i <= length-2`.
actions:
  - scan: Iterate through the input sequence, focusing on elements from index 1 to index `length - 2`.
  - identify_pattern: For each element at index `i`, check if it forms the center of a `0 X 0` pattern based on the original input sequence values.
  - copy: Create an initial output sequence identical to the input sequence.
  - update: If a `0 X 0` pattern is identified centered at index `i` with value `X` in the input sequence, modify the elements at indices `i-1` and `i+1` in the *output* sequence to the value `X`.
  - preserve: Elements in the output sequence that are not modified by the 'update' action retain their original values from the input sequence.
