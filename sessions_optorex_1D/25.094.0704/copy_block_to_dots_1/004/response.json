            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided information includes training examples (input/output pairs) and the results of executing a Python script (`code_00.py`) intended to perform the transformation. However, the execution results consistently show the output being identical to the input, which contradicts the expected outputs derived from the examples. The expected outputs strongly suggest a pattern where a non-zero digit `X` surrounded by zeros (`0 X 0`) causes the zeros to be replaced by `X`, resulting in `X X X`.\n\n**Discrepancy:** The execution results showing an identity transformation are likely due to an error in the specific execution run or a bug in the script that was actually executed, rather than indicating that the identity transformation is the correct rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Prioritize the input/output examples provided over the erroneous execution results to understand the intended transformation rule.\n2.  Verify the hypothesized rule (`0 X 0` -> `X X X`) against all examples using `tool_code`.\n3.  Based on the verification, refine the documentation (facts and natural language program) to accurately describe the confirmed rule.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nThe following code simulates the hypothesized transformation rule (`0 X 0` -> `X X X`) and checks it against all provided examples.\n\n"
