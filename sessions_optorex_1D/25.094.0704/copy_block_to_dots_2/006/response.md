**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided execution results indicate that the previous code consistently failed to produce the correct output, often returning the original input sequence unchanged. This suggests a fundamental flaw either in the identification of "trigger points" or in the application of the replacement rule. The core logic described (find `N` at index `i` where `i >= 3` and `input[i-1] != N`, then replace `output[i-1]`, `output[i]`, `output[i+1]` with `N`) appears visually correct when comparing inputs and expected outputs.

The strategy is to:
1. Re-verify the transformation rule by closely examining each input/output pair and the failed output.
2. Use code execution to precisely calculate the expected changes (trigger indices, replacement locations) for each example.
3. Confirm that the Natural Language Program and YAML accurately capture this verified rule, paying close attention to index boundaries and the condition for triggering a replacement. The failure might be in the implementation details (like list copying or loop bounds) rather than the high-level rule description, but the goal here is to refine the *description* first.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's analyze each example to confirm the trigger points and expected transformations based on the rule: "Identify indices `i` where `3 <= i < length-1`, `input[i] == N`, and `input[i-1] != N`. For each such `i`, set `output[i-1]`, `output[i]`, `output[i+1]` to `N`."

Summary: Does the described logic match all provided examples? True

```
The code execution confirms that the logic described (find triggers based on `input[i] == N` and `input[i-1] != N` for `3 <= i < length-1`, then modify a *copy* of the list at `i-1, i, i+1`) perfectly replicates the transformations shown in all provided examples, including the test set example. The failure of the previous code execution likely stemmed from an implementation error or an issue in the testing environment, not from an incorrect understanding of the transformation rule itself.

**YAML Fact Document**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (fixed based on examples)
      - contains: Primarily zeros and one repeating non-zero integer (N)
      - structure: Often starts with [N, N, N, ...], but the core logic doesn't strictly depend on this starting pattern, only on finding the first N.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (same as input)
      - derived_from: input_sequence via a conditional replacement rule.
  - name: non_zero_integer
    symbol: N
    properties:
      - value: Determined by the first non-zero element found in the input_sequence.
      - role: The digit used for triggering and replacement.
  - name: zero
    symbol: 0
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: Background element, absence of N.

actions:

    description: >
      Iterate through the input_sequence from index i = 3 up to (length - 2).
      A trigger point is found at index 'i' if input_sequence[i] equals N
      AND input_sequence[i-1] does NOT equal N. Collect all such indices 'i'.

    description: >
      1. Create a mutable copy of the input_sequence.
      2. For each index 'i' in the trigger_indices list:
         Modify the copy by setting the elements at indices (i-1), i, and (i+1) to the value N.
      3. The final modified copy is the output_sequence.

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: >
      The output sequence is derived from the input sequence. First, the characteristic non-zero integer N is identified. Then, trigger points are located in the original input sequence based on the condition N appearing at index i (3 <= i < length-1) preceded by a non-N value. Finally, a copy of the input sequence is modified: for every trigger point i, the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 are replaced with N.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a sequence of 12 integers (represented as a list, `input_list`).
2.  Determine the primary non-zero integer, `N`, by scanning `input_list` from the beginning and taking the first non-zero value encountered. If the list contains only zeros, return the original list.
3.  Create a new list, `output_list`, which is initially an identical copy of `input_list`.
4.  Create an empty list called `trigger_indices`.
5.  Iterate through the `input_list` using an index `i`, starting from `i = 3` and going up to, but not including, `length - 1` (where `length` is the total number of elements, 12). This means the last index checked is `i = 10`.
6.  Inside the loop, for each index `i`, check if the following two conditions are met:
    *   The element at `input_list[i]` is equal to `N`.
    *   The element at the preceding index, `input_list[i-1]`, is *not* equal to `N`.
7.  If both conditions are true, add the current index `i` to the `trigger_indices` list.
8.  After checking all possible indices `i`, iterate through each index `trigger_index` stored in the `trigger_indices` list.
9.  For each `trigger_index`, modify the `output_list` by setting the values at the following three positions to `N`:
    *   `output_list[trigger_index - 1]`
    *   `output_list[trigger_index]`
    *   `output_list[trigger_index + 1]`
10. Once all modifications for all `trigger_indices` are complete, the `output_list` contains the final transformed sequence. Return this `output_list`.
