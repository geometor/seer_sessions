objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - content: Contains zeros and a single repeating non-zero integer (N).
      - structure: Typically starts with [N, N, N, ...], but the core logic applies regardless of the start.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (same as input)
      - derivation: Created by modifying a copy of the input_sequence based on identified trigger points.
  - name: non_zero_integer
    symbol: N
    properties:
      - value: The first non-zero integer found in the input_sequence.
      - role: Used for pattern identification and replacement value.
  - name: zero
    symbol: 0
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: Background value, part of the trigger condition (preceding element must not be N, often is 0).
  - name: trigger_point
    type: concept
    properties:
      - location: An index `i` in the input_sequence.
      - condition: `i >= 3` AND `input_sequence[i] == N` AND `input_sequence[i-1] != N`.
      - boundary_condition: The index `i` must be less than `length - 1` to allow replacement at `i+1`.

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_integer
    actor: rule_processor
    input: input_sequence
    output: non_zero_integer (N)
    description: Find the first element in the sequence that is not zero.
  - name: find_trigger_indices
    actor: rule_processor
    input: input_sequence, non_zero_integer (N)
    output: list_of_indices
    description: >
      Iterate through the input_sequence from index `i = 3` up to `length - 2`.
      Collect all indices `i` that satisfy the trigger_point condition.
  - name: initialize_output
    actor: rule_processor
    input: input_sequence
    output: mutable_output_sequence
    description: Create an independent, modifiable copy of the input_sequence.
  - name: apply_transformation
    actor: rule_processor
    target: mutable_output_sequence
    using: list_of_trigger_indices, non_zero_integer (N)
    description: >
      For each trigger index `i` found in the 'find_trigger_indices' step:
      Set the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the
      mutable_output_sequence to the value N.

relationships:
  - type: derivation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: >
      The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by first creating a copy.
      Then, identify all trigger_point indices 'i' within the original input_sequence.
      Finally, for each identified trigger index 'i', modify the copied sequence by
      setting the values at indices [i-1, i, i+1] to N.
  - type: dependency
    action: apply_transformation
    depends_on: find_trigger_indices, initialize_output
    description: The transformation can only be applied after triggers are found and the output sequence is initialized.
