Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are space-separated strings of integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** All input and output sequences consistently have a length of 12 integers.
3.  **Content:** The sequences primarily consist of zeros and one specific non-zero integer (e.g., 4, 7, 6, 8).
4.  **Initial Pattern:** All inputs start with three repetitions of the non-zero integer (e.g., `4 4 4`, `7 7 7`). This initial block appears unchanged in the output.
5.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur *after* the initial `N N N` block. Specifically, single occurrences of the non-zero integer `N` later in the sequence seem to trigger a transformation.
6.  **Transformation Rule:** When a non-zero integer `N` is found at index `i` (where `i > 2`) and the preceding element at `i-1` is *not* `N`, it triggers a replacement. The elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output sequence are replaced with `N N N`. This replacement happens for every such identified trigger point based on the original input sequence.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - contains: zeros and a repeating non-zero integer (N)
      - structure: Starts with [N, N, N, ...]
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (same as input)
      - derived_from: input_sequence
  - name: non_zero_integer
    symbol: N
    properties:
      - value: Determined by the first element of the input_sequence
      - role: Primary digit used in patterns and replacements
  - name: zero
    symbol: 0
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: Placeholder or separator

actions:
  - name: identify_trigger_points

    output: list_of_indices
    description: >
      Find indices 'i' (starting from index 3 up to length-1)
      where input_sequence[i] == N and input_sequence[i-1] != N.

    description: >
      For each identified trigger point index 'i', set the elements
      at indices [i-1, i, i+1] in the mutable copy to N.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: >
      The output sequence is generated by copying the input sequence and then,
      for each identified trigger point 'i' in the input, replacing the
      elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 in the copy with N, N, N.
  - type: definition
    element: non_zero_integer (N)
    defined_by: The value at index 0 of the input_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and convert it into a list of integers called `input_list`.
2.  Identify the non-zero integer `N` by taking the value of the element at index 0 in `input_list`.
3.  Create a new list called `output_list` as a direct copy of `input_list`.
4.  Identify all indices `i` in the `input_list`, starting from index `i = 3` up to the second-to-last index (`length - 2`), such that the element at index `i` is equal to `N` *and* the element at the preceding index `i-1` is *not* equal to `N`. Store these indices `i` as "trigger points".
5.  For each identified "trigger point" index `i`:
    a.  Modify the `output_list` by setting the element at index `i-1` to `N`.
    b.  Modify the `output_list` by setting the element at index `i` to `N`.
    c.  Modify the `output_list` by setting the element at index `i+1` to `N`.
6.  Convert the final `output_list` back into a space-separated string. This is the result.
