This initial block appears unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Transformation Focus:** The changes occur *after* the initial `N N N` block. Specifically, single occurrences of the non-zero integer `N` later in the sequence seem to trigger a transformation.\n6.  **Transformation Rule:** When a non-zero integer `N` is found at index `i` (where `i > 2`) and the preceding element at `i-1` is *not* `N`, it triggers a replacement. The elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the output sequence are replaced with `N N N`. This replacement happens for every such identified trigger point based on the original input sequence.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
