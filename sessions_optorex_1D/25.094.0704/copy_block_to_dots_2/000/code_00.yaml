objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - contains: zeros and a repeating non-zero integer (N)
      - structure: Starts with [N, N, N, ...]
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (same as input)
      - derived_from: input_sequence
  - name: non_zero_integer
    symbol: N
    properties:
      - value: Determined by the first element of the input_sequence
      - role: Primary digit used in patterns and replacements
  - name: zero
    symbol: 0
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: Placeholder or separator

actions:
  - name: identify_trigger_points
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: input_sequence
    output: list_of_indices
    description: >
      Find indices 'i' (starting from index 3 up to length-1)
      where input_sequence[i] == N and input_sequence[i-1] != N.
  - name: copy_sequence
    actor: transformation_rule
    input: input_sequence
    output: mutable_copy_of_sequence (initially identical to input)
  - name: replace_elements
    actor: transformation_rule
    target: mutable_copy_of_sequence
    using: non_zero_integer (N), trigger_point_index (i)
    description: >
      For each identified trigger point index 'i', set the elements
      at indices [i-1, i, i+1] in the mutable copy to N.

relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: >
      The output sequence is generated by copying the input sequence and then,
      for each identified trigger point 'i' in the input, replacing the
      elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 in the copy with N, N, N.
  - type: definition
    element: non_zero_integer (N)
    defined_by: The value at index 0 of the input_sequence.
