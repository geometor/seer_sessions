            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    *   The primary issue reported (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`) stems from an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but it appears to have received NumPy arrays during testing. This suggests an incompatibility between the function's input handling and the testing environment's data delivery format.\n    *   The core logic derived from the initial example (identifying an \"active digit\" and expanding its occurrences at indices `i > 2` to cover `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`) needs to be verified against all provided training examples.\n    *   Strategy:\n        1.  Assume the input can be treated as a list of 12 integers, regardless of the initial format (string or NumPy array).\n        2.  Re-analyze each input/output pair to confirm the transformation rule holds universally.\n        3.  Refine the YAML facts and natural language program based on this comprehensive analysis. The core logic might be correct, but nuances might emerge from examining all examples.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    *   **Data Format:** Input and output are sequences of 12 integers.\n    *   **Key Element:** A single non-zero integer (\"active digit\") appears in each sequence, usually starting with a block of three at the beginning.\n    *   **Transformation Trigger:** Occurrences of the \"active digit\" in the *input* sequence at index `i`, where `3 <= i <= 10`.\n    *   **Transformation Action:** For each trigger found at index `i` in the input, the *output* sequence has the \"active digit\" placed at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. The output sequence is initialized as a copy of the input, and modifications are cumulative based on all triggers found in the *original* input.\n\n    *Let's verify this rule against each example:*\n    "
