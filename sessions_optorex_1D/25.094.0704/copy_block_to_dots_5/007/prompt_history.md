*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are fixed-length sequences (12 elements) of single-digit integers.
    *   Each sequence consists primarily of zeros (`0`) and a single recurring non-zero digit (e.g., `1`, `7`, `4`, `5`, `3`). Let's call this the "active digit".
    *   The active digit typically appears in a block at the beginning of the sequence (e.g., `1 1 1`, `7 7 7`).
    *   The active digit may also appear sporadically later in the input sequence, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The transformation seems to involve "expanding" these later occurrences of the active digit.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'
## General Assessment

The primary issue causing the errors is a mismatch between the expected input type in the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array). The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this. The function attempts string methods (`.strip()`, `.split()`) on an array object.

The core transformation logic described in the previous natural language program and implemented in the code appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The rule involves identifying an "active digit" and then, for occurrences of this digit at index `i` (within a specific range) in the *input*, modifying the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the *output* sequence.

The strategy to resolve the errors is to modify the `transform` function to correctly handle NumPy arrays as input. This involves removing the string parsing steps and directly working with the array elements. The rest of the logic (identifying the active digit, iterating, and applying the replacement rule) should remain conceptually the same but operate on array indices and values.

## Metrics and Observations

Let's analyze the examples assuming the input is a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers.

*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` based on the error messages.
*   **Output Type:** Expected to be `numpy.ndarray` (or potentially converted back to a string in the final step, depending on the specific environment requirements, but the core logic operates on array/list data).
*   **Sequence Length:** All examples have input and output sequences of length 12.
*   **Element Types:** Sequences contain non-negative integers.
*   **Active Digit:** In each example, there is exactly one non-zero digit present in the input. This digit acts as the 'active digit'.
    *   train_1: 1
    *   train_2: 1
    *   train_3: 7
    *   train_4: 7
    *   train_5: 4
    *   train_6: 5
    *   train_7: 3
*   **Transformation Rule:** The rule holds consistently: Find the active digit. Create a copy of the input array for the output. Iterate through the *input* array from index 3 to 10. If `input[i]` equals the active digit, set `output[i-1]`, `output[i]`, and `output[i+1]` to the active digit.
*   **Trigger Indices:** The indices `i` in the *input* sequence that trigger the transformation (where `input[i] == active_digit` and `3 <= i <= 10`):
    *   train_1: `i = 9`
    *   train_2: `i = 6`
    *   train_3: `i = 5`
    *   train_4: `i = 5`, `i = 9`
    *   train_5: `i = 9`
    *   train_6: `i = 6`
    *   train_7: `i = 5`
*   **Output Verification:** The outputs consistently match the application of the rule based on the input triggers. For `train_4`, both triggers (at index 5 and 9) contribute to the final output by modifying the corresponding 3-element blocks in the output array.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept an input sequence (assumed to be a NumPy array or list of 12 integers).
2.  Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence; this will be the output sequence.
3.  Identify the "active digit": Iterate through the input sequence and find the first non-zero integer. If no non-zero digit is found, return the original sequence copy.
4.  Iterate through the *input* sequence using an index `i` ranging from 3 up to and including 10.
5.  For each index `i`:
    *   Check if the element at index `i` in the *input* sequence is equal to the "active digit".
    *   If it is, modify the *output* sequence by setting the elements at index `i-1`, index `i`, and index `i+1` to the "active digit".
6.  Return the modified output sequence (in the same format as the input, likely NumPy array or list).
