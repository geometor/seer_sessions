Let's call this the \"active digit\".\n    *   The active digit typically appears in a block at the beginning of the sequence (e.g., `1 1 1`, `7 7 7`).\n    *   The active digit may also appear sporadically later in the input sequence, surrounded by zeros.\n    *   The transformation seems to involve \"expanding\" these later occurrences of the active digit.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
