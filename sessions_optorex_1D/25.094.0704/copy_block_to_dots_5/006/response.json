            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe primary issue causing the errors is a mismatch between the expected input type in the `transform` function (a space-separated string) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array). The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this. The function attempts string methods (`.strip()`, `.split()`) on an array object.\n\nThe core transformation logic described in the previous natural language program and implemented in the code appears correct based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The rule involves identifying an \"active digit\" and then, for occurrences of this digit at index `i` (within a specific range) in the *input*, modifying the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` in the *output* sequence.\n\nThe strategy to resolve the errors is to modify the `transform` function to correctly handle NumPy arrays as input. This involves removing the string parsing steps and directly working with the array elements. The rest of the logic (identifying the active digit, iterating, and applying the replacement rule) should remain conceptually the same but operate on array indices and values.\n\n## Metrics and Observations\n\nLet's analyze the examples assuming the input is a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers.\n\n*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` based on the error messages.\n*   **Output Type:** Expected to be `numpy.ndarray` (or potentially converted back to a string in the final step, depending on the specific environment requirements, but the core logic operates on array/list data).\n*   **Sequence Length:** All examples have input and output sequences of length 12.\n*   **Element Types:** Sequences contain non-negative integers.\n*   **Active Digit:** In each example, there is exactly one non-zero digit present in the input. This digit acts as the 'active digit'.\n    *   train_1: 1\n    *   train_2: 1\n    *   train_3: 7\n    *   train_4: 7\n    *   train_5: 4\n    *   train_6: 5\n    *   train_7: 3\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The rule holds consistently: Find the active digit. Create a copy of the input array for the output. Iterate through the *input* array from index 3 to 10. If `input[i]` equals the active digit, set `output[i-1]`, `output[i]`, and `output[i+1]` to the active digit.\n*   **Trigger Indices:** The indices `i` in the *input* sequence that trigger the transformation (where `input[i] == active_digit` and `3 <= i <= 10`):\n    *   train_1: `i = 9`\n    *   train_2: `i = 6`\n    *   train_3: `i = 5`\n    *   train_4: `i = 5`, `i = 9`\n    *   train_5: `i = 9`\n    *   train_6: `i = 6`\n    *   train_7: `i = 5`\n*   **Output Verification:** The outputs consistently match the application of the rule based on the input triggers. For `train_4`, both triggers (at index 5 and 9) contribute to the final output by modifying the corresponding 3-element blocks in the output array.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
