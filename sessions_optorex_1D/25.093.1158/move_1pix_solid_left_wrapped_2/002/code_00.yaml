Task: Sequence Rotation Left (NumPy Array)

Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: (12,) # Confirmed constant length across examples
      - dtype: int   # Deduced from error context and confirmed by simulation
      - ordered: True

Actions:
  - name: Rotate Left (NumPy)
    input: Sequence (numpy.ndarray, shape=(12,), dtype=int)
    output: Sequence (numpy.ndarray, shape=(12,), dtype=int)
    description: Performs a circular shift of the array elements one position to the left. The element at index 0 moves to index 11.

Relationships:
  - type: Transformation
    from: Input Sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    to: Output Sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    rule: Apply the "Rotate Left (NumPy)" action once to the Input Sequence.
