The output sequence always has the same length as the input sequence.\n*   **Element Types:** The elements are single digits (0-9).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a positional shift of the elements within the sequence. Comparing input and output in each example, the entire sequence appears to be rotated one position to the left. The element originally at the first position (index 0) moves to the last position (index 11), and every other element shifts one position towards the beginning.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
