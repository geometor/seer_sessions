Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits, represented as space-separated strings.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence appears constant across examples (12 elements). The output sequence always has the same length as the input sequence.
*   **Element Types:** The elements are single digits (0-9).
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to be a positional shift of the elements within the sequence. Comparing input and output in each example, the entire sequence appears to be rotated one position to the left. The element originally at the first position (index 0) moves to the last position (index 11), and every other element shifts one position towards the beginning.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Rotation Left

Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: List[Integer] # Conceptually integers, though input is string digits
    properties:
      - ordered: True
      - fixed_length: 12 # Based on examples
      - elements: Single Digits (0-9)

Actions:
  - name: Rotate Left
    input: Sequence
    output: Sequence
    description: Shifts all elements one position to the left. The first element wraps around to become the last element.

Relationships:
  - type: Transformation
    from: Input Sequence
    to: Output Sequence
    rule: Apply "Rotate Left" action once to the Input Sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Perform a circular shift (rotation) of the sequence one position to the left.
3.  The element at the first position moves to the last position.
4.  All other elements shift one position forward (e.g., the element at index `i` moves to index `i-1`).
5.  Output the resulting sequence.
