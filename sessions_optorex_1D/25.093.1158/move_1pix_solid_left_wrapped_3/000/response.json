            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.\n*   **Length Consistency:** The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence (12 in all provided examples).\n*   **Element Preservation:** The multiset of numbers appears to be the same in the input and output, suggesting that elements are rearranged rather than added, removed, or changed in value.\n*   **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing inputs and outputs, it seems one specific element is removed from its original position and appended to the end of the sequence. The elements originally following the removed element shift one position to the left to fill the gap.\n\n**Identifying the Moved Element:**\n\nLet's trace which element moves in each example:\n\n1.  `9 9 9 9 9 9 [9] 0 0 0 9 9` -> `9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 [9]` (Element at index 6 moved)\n2.  `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 [3] 0 3` -> `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 [3]` (Element at index 9 moved)\n3.  `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 [7] 0 0 7 7` -> `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7 7 [7]` (Element at index 7 moved)\n4.  `0 0 [0] 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0` -> `0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 [0]` (Element at index 2 moved)\n5.  `9 9 9 9 [9] 0 9 9 9 9 9 9` -> `9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 [9]` (Element at index 4 moved)\n6.  `[3] 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3` -> `0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 [3]` (Element at index 0 moved)\n7.  `2 2 2 [2] 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2` -> `2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 [2]` (Element at index 3 moved)\n\nThe pattern emerges: the element being moved is consistently the *last* element of the *first contiguous block* of identical numbers found at the beginning of the input sequence.\n\n**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**\n\n"
