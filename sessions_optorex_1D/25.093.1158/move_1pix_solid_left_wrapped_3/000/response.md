Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
*   **Length Consistency:** The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence (12 in all provided examples).
*   **Element Preservation:** The multiset of numbers appears to be the same in the input and output, suggesting that elements are rearranged rather than added, removed, or changed in value.
*   **Transformation Pattern:** Comparing inputs and outputs, it seems one specific element is removed from its original position and appended to the end of the sequence. The elements originally following the removed element shift one position to the left to fill the gap.

**Identifying the Moved Element:**

Let's trace which element moves in each example:

1.  `9 9 9 9 9 9 [9] 0 0 0 9 9` -> `9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 [9]` (Element at index 6 moved)
2.  `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 [3] 0 3` -> `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 [3]` (Element at index 9 moved)
3.  `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 [7] 0 0 7 7` -> `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7 7 [7]` (Element at index 7 moved)
4.  `0 0 [0] 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0` -> `0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 [0]` (Element at index 2 moved)
5.  `9 9 9 9 [9] 0 9 9 9 9 9 9` -> `9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 [9]` (Element at index 4 moved)
6.  `[3] 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3` -> `0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 [3]` (Element at index 0 moved)
7.  `2 2 2 [2] 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2` -> `2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 [2]` (Element at index 3 moved)

The pattern emerges: the element being moved is consistently the *last* element of the *first contiguous block* of identical numbers found at the beginning of the input sequence.

**YAML Block Documenting Facts:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of single-digit integers
      - length: constant (12 in examples)
      - elements: preserved, but reordered
relationship: input sequence transforms into output sequence
actions:
  - action: identify_first_run
    description: Find the first contiguous run of identical integers starting from the beginning of the input sequence.
    target: input sequence
    output: index of the last element of this run
  - action: move_element_to_end
    description: Remove the element at the identified index and append it to the end of the sequence.
    target: element at the identified index
    effect: modifies the sequence order
  - action: shift_elements_left
    description: Elements originally following the removed element shift left by one position.
    target: elements after the removed element's original position
    effect: fills the gap left by the removed element
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Identify the first number in the sequence.
3.  Find the index of the last occurrence of this number within the initial contiguous block where it appears.
4.  Take the number located at this index.
5.  Remove this number from its current position in the sequence.
6.  Append this removed number to the very end of the sequence.
7.  The resulting sequence is the output.
