task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of single-digit integers
      - length: constant (12 in examples)
      - elements: preserved, but reordered
relationship: input sequence transforms into output sequence
actions:
  - action: identify_first_run
    description: Find the first contiguous run of identical integers starting from the beginning of the input sequence.
    target: input sequence
    output: index of the last element of this run
  - action: move_element_to_end
    description: Remove the element at the identified index and append it to the end of the sequence.
    target: element at the identified index
    effect: modifies the sequence order
  - action: shift_elements_left
    description: Elements originally following the removed element shift left by one position.
    target: elements after the removed element's original position
    effect: fills the gap left by the removed element
