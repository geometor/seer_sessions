            "text": "Okay, let's refine the analysis and the natural language program based on the new information that the previous code failed due to an input type mismatch.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core issue identified (`TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`) strongly suggests that the input data provided to the `transform` function was not a simple 1D list of integers as initially assumed from the string representations. Instead, it was likely a NumPy array that, when converted using `.tolist()`, resulted in a nested list structure (e.g., `[[0, 0, 5, ...]]` for a 1xN array). The block identification logic then incorrectly treated the inner list as an element, leading to the error when attempting to use this list as a dictionary key (which requires hashable types).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Correct the input handling to ensure we are working with a flat list of integers, regardless of whether the input NumPy array is 1D or 2D (specifically 1xN). Using `input_grid.flatten().tolist()` seems the most robust approach.\n2.  Re-validate the core transformation logic (identify blocks, find transfer pattern, modify block lengths, reconstruct) against all examples, assuming the corrected input handling. Based on a mental walk-through (detailed in the thought process), the existing logic appears correct for all provided examples once the input parsing is fixed.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the input data structure (likely a 1xN or flattenable NumPy array) and the confirmed transformation steps.\n\n**Metrics Gathering (Based on Re-evaluation)**\n\nAssuming the input is flattened correctly before processing:\n\n| Example | Input                               | Expected Output                     | Blocks (Input)              | Transfer Digit | Blocks (Output)            | Reconstructed Output                | Match |\n| :------ | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :---- |\n| train_1 | `0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0`           | `0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0`           | `[(0,3), (5,5), (0,4)]`     | 0              | `[(0,2), (5,5), (0,5)]`    | `0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0`           | Yes   |\n| train_2 | `4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4`           | `4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4`           | `[(4,2), (0,9), (4,1)]`     | 4              | `[(4,1), (0,9), (4,2)]`    | `4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4`           | Yes   |\n| train_3 | `2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2`           | `0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2`           | `[(2,1), (0,6), (2,5)]`     | 2              | `[(0,6), (2,6)]`           | `0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2`           | Yes   |\n| train_4 | `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7`           | `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 7`           | `[(7,8), (0,3), (7,1)]`     | 7              | `[(7,7), (0,3), (7,2)]`    | `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 7`           | Yes   |\n| train_5 | `6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6`           | `6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6`           | `[(6,8), (0,1), (6,3)]`     | 6              | `[(6,7), (0,1), (6,4)]`    | `6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6`           | Yes   |\n| train_6 | `8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`           | `8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`           | `[(8,4), (0,1), (8,7)]`     | 8              | `[(8,3), (0,1), (8,8)]`    | `8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`           | Yes   |\n| train_7 | `8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8`           | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8`           | `[(8,1), (0,8), (8,3)]`     | 8              | `[(0,8), (8,4)]`           | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8`           | Yes   |\n\nThe analysis indicates the logic should work for all examples once the input parsing is fixed.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
