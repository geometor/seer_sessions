            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates that the `transform` function was designed expecting a string input (based on the initial examples which were presented as strings), but it was executed with NumPy arrays as input during testing.\n\nThe strategy is straightforward:\n1.  Modify the input handling part of the `transform` function (and its helpers like `parse_input`) to accept a NumPy array of integers directly, instead of expecting a space-separated string.\n2.  Re-evaluate the core logic (block identification, transfer pattern finding, element shifting) to ensure it functions correctly with the array/list data structure derived from the NumPy input. The fundamental concept of identifying blocks and shifting an element seems correct based on the original string examples, but needs to be confirmed with the array input type.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nThe consistent error across all examples prevents analysis of the core transformation logic's success rate. The failure occurs at the initial input processing stage.\n\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`\n*   **Affected Examples:** All 7 training examples.\n*   **Cause:** The `parse_input` function, called by `transform`, attempts to use the string method `.split()` on the input, which is actually a NumPy array.\n\nWe can demonstrate the intended parsing logic adjusted for a NumPy array:\n\n"
