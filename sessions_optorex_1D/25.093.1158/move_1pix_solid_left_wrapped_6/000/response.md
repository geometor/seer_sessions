Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single strings representing sequences of space-separated single digits (0-9).
2.  **Sequence Length:** All examples show input and output sequences of length 12.
3.  **Content:** The sequences contain digits, primarily '0' and one other dominant non-zero digit per example. The set of digits present generally remains the same, but their positions change.
4.  **Structure:** The digits appear in contiguous blocks of identical values (e.g., `0 0 0`, `5 5 5 5 5`).
5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve shifting *one* digit from one block to another block of the *same* digit, across an intervening block of a *different* digit. Specifically, it looks like an element is moved from the *first* block of a certain digit type to the *last* block of that same digit type.

**Facts:**


```yaml
# YAML document describing objects, properties, and relationships

# Input/Output Data Structure
data_structure:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer_digit
  representation: space-separated_string
  length: 12

# Identified Objects and Properties
objects:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - contains_digits: true
      - fixed_length: 12
      - composed_of_blocks: true # Consecutive identical digits form blocks

  - object: block
    properties:
      - consists_of_identical_digits: true
      - has_digit_value: (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
      - has_length: (number of digits in the block)

# Relationships and Actions
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    description: Blocks are ordered sequentially within the main sequence.
  - type: separation
    description: Blocks of one digit type can be separated by blocks of another digit type.

actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    description: Group consecutive identical digits into blocks, noting their digit value and length.
    example_input: "0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0"
    example_output: "[Block(digit=0, length=3), Block(digit=5, length=5), Block(digit=0, length=4)]"

  - action: find_transfer_pattern
    description: >
      Locate the first block and the last block composed of the *same* digit (either 0 or a non-zero digit),
      such that they are separated by one or more blocks of a *different* digit.
    condition: Requires at least two blocks of one digit type separated by at least one block of another type.

  - action: transfer_element
    description: >
      If the transfer pattern is found, decrease the length of the first identified block by one
      and increase the length of the last identified block (of the same digit) by one.
      The separating blocks remain unchanged in position and content.
    target_objects: [first_block, last_block] # of the same digit type
    effect: first_block.length -= 1, last_block.length += 1

  - action: reconstruct_sequence
    description: Combine the modified (or original, if no transfer occurred) blocks back into a single sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a sequence of integer digits.
2.  Identify contiguous blocks of identical digits within the sequence, noting the digit value and the number of digits (length) for each block.
3.  Iterate through the unique digit values present in the blocks (e.g., 0, 5 in the first example).
4.  For each unique digit value, find the index of the *first* block containing that digit and the index of the *last* block containing that *same* digit.
5.  Check if the first block index is strictly less than the last block index (i.e., there are at least two distinct blocks of this digit).
6.  If they are distinct, check if all blocks *between* the first and last block contain a *different* digit value.
7.  If both conditions (distinct blocks of the same digit separated only by blocks of different digits) are met, perform the transfer:
    a.  Decrement the length count of the first block by one.
    b.  Increment the length count of the last block by one.
    c.  Stop searching for other patterns (assume only one such transfer occurs per input).
8.  Reconstruct the output sequence by concatenating the digits according to the (potentially modified) block lengths. Remove any blocks whose length became zero.
9.  Format the resulting sequence as a space-separated string.
