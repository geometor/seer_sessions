The set of digits present generally remains the same, but their positions change.\n4.  **Structure:** The digits appear in contiguous blocks of identical values (e.g., `0 0 0`, `5 5 5 5 5`).\n5.  **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve shifting *one* digit from one block to another block of the *same* digit, across an intervening block of a *different* digit. Specifically, it looks like an element is moved from the *first* block of a certain digit type to the *last* block of that same digit type.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Decrement the length count of the first block by one.\n    b.  Increment the length count of the last block by one.\n    c.  Stop searching for other patterns (assume only one such transfer occurs per input).\n8.
