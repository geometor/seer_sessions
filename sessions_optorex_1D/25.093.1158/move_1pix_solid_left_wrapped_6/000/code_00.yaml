# YAML document describing objects, properties, and relationships

# Input/Output Data Structure
data_structure:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer_digit
  representation: space-separated_string
  length: 12

# Identified Objects and Properties
objects:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - contains_digits: true
      - fixed_length: 12
      - composed_of_blocks: true # Consecutive identical digits form blocks

  - object: block
    properties:
      - consists_of_identical_digits: true
      - has_digit_value: (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
      - has_length: (number of digits in the block)

# Relationships and Actions
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    description: Blocks are ordered sequentially within the main sequence.
  - type: separation
    description: Blocks of one digit type can be separated by blocks of another digit type.

actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    description: Group consecutive identical digits into blocks, noting their digit value and length.
    example_input: "0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0"
    example_output: "[Block(digit=0, length=3), Block(digit=5, length=5), Block(digit=0, length=4)]"

  - action: find_transfer_pattern
    description: >
      Locate the first block and the last block composed of the *same* digit (either 0 or a non-zero digit),
      such that they are separated by one or more blocks of a *different* digit.
    condition: Requires at least two blocks of one digit type separated by at least one block of another type.

  - action: transfer_element
    description: >
      If the transfer pattern is found, decrease the length of the first identified block by one
      and increase the length of the last identified block (of the same digit) by one.
      The separating blocks remain unchanged in position and content.
    target_objects: [first_block, last_block] # of the same digit type
    effect: first_block.length -= 1, last_block.length += 1

  - action: reconstruct_sequence
    description: Combine the modified (or original, if no transfer occurred) blocks back into a single sequence.
