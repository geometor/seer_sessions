objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers
      - length: fixed (appears to be 12 in all examples)
      - ordered: yes
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9 observed)
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)

actions:
  - name: move
    actor: first_element
    target: end_of_sequence
    effect: changes the order of elements
  - name: shift_left
    actor: remaining_elements (index 1 to end)
    effect: elements move one position towards the beginning of the sequence

relationships:
  - type: positional
    between: elements
    description: Each element has a specific index in the sequence.
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by moving the first element to the end.

derived_operation:
  - name: rotate_left
    description: The entire sequence is rotated one position to the left. The element at index 0 moves to the last index, and all other elements shift one index down.
