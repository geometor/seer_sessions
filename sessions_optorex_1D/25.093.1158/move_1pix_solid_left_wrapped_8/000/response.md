## Perception

The task involves manipulating sequences of numbers. Each input is a list of integers. The corresponding output is also a list of integers of the same length. The transformation consistently involves rearranging the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the first element of the input sequence appears to be moved to the last position in the output sequence, while all other elements shift one position to the left.

## Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: integers
      - length: fixed (appears to be 12 in all examples)
      - ordered: yes
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: integer (0-9 observed)
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)

actions:
  - name: move
    actor: first_element
    target: end_of_sequence
    effect: changes the order of elements
  - name: shift_left
    actor: remaining_elements (index 1 to end)
    effect: elements move one position towards the beginning of the sequence

relationships:
  - type: positional
    between: elements
    description: Each element has a specific index in the sequence.
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    rule: The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by moving the first element to the end.

derived_operation:
  - name: rotate_left
    description: The entire sequence is rotated one position to the left. The element at index 0 moves to the last index, and all other elements shift one index down.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the input sequence of numbers.
2.  Take the first element (at index 0) from the input sequence.
3.  Create a new sequence containing all elements from the input sequence starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element.
4.  Append the element identified in step 2 (the original first element) to the end of the new sequence created in step 3.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
