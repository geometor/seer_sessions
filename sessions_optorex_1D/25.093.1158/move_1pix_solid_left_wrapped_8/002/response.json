            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided information indicates that the initial Python code, designed to perform a left rotation on a sequence, failed during execution across all training and test examples. The consistent error message, \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\", strongly suggests that the `transform` function is receiving input data as NumPy arrays rather than standard Python lists. The conditional check `if not input_sequence:` is causing this error because NumPy does not define truthiness for multi-element arrays in this way.\n\nThe core transformation logic (left rotation) appears correct based on the visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the Python code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, specifically by changing the initial check for emptiness to be compatible with NumPy arrays (e.g., using `input_sequence.size == 0`). The underlying natural language program describing the left rotation remains accurate.\n\n## Metrics\n\nBased on the error messages and simulation:\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** The `transform` function receives input as NumPy arrays (`numpy.ndarray`).\n*   **Input Shape:** The input arrays are one-dimensional (e.g., shape `(12,)` for the examples shown).\n*   **Error Source:** The `ValueError` occurs due to the boolean evaluation of a multi-element NumPy array in the line `if not input_sequence:`.\n*   **Transformation Logic Validity:** The left rotation logic, as implemented using `collections.deque`, appears to correctly produce the desired output structure when applied to the elements of the input array. The simulation showed `collections.deque(numpy_array)` works as intended for rotation.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
