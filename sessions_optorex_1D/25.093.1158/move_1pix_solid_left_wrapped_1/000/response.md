Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers, presented as space-separated strings.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence appears constant (12 elements in all examples).
*   **Core Transformation:** The transformation seems to involve rearranging the elements. Specifically, one element is removed from its position and appended to the end of the sequence.
*   **Key Element '0':** The digit `0` plays a crucial role in determining which element gets moved.
*   **Conditional Logic:** The element being moved depends on the value of the very first element in the input sequence.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: list[int]
      - length: int (appears constant at 12)
  - name: element
    type: int
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - index: int (position in the sequence)
  - name: first_element
    type: element
    description: The element at index 0 of the input sequence.
  - name: first_zero
    type: element
    description: The element with value 0 having the minimum index in the input sequence.
  - name: target_element
    type: element
    description: The specific element that is moved during the transformation.

actions:
  - name: identify_first_element
    description: Get the element at index 0.
  - name: find_first_zero_index
    description: Find the index of the first occurrence of the element 0. Returns null or raises error if 0 is not present (though 0 seems always present in examples).
  - name: select_target_element
    description: Determine which element to move based on the value of the first_element.
  - name: remove_element
    description: Remove an element from the sequence at a specific index.
  - name: append_element
    description: Add an element to the end of the sequence.

relationships:
  - type: conditional_dependency
    subject: target_element
    condition: value of first_element
    description: >
      If the first_element value is 0, the target_element is the first_element itself.
      If the first_element value is not 0, the target_element is the element at index (find_first_zero_index - 1).
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    process: Remove target_element from its original position and append it to the end of the sequence.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Check the value of the element at the first position (index 0).
3.  **Case 1:** If the first element's value is 0:
    *   Identify the element at index 0 as the `target_element`.
    *   Remove the `target_element` from the sequence.
    *   Append the `target_element` to the end of the modified sequence.
4.  **Case 2:** If the first element's value is *not* 0:
    *   Find the index of the first occurrence of the value 0 in the sequence. Let this be `first_zero_index`.
    *   Identify the element at index `first_zero_index - 1` as the `target_element`.
    *   Remove the `target_element` from the sequence.
    *   Append the `target_element` to the end of the modified sequence.
5.  Return the final sequence.
