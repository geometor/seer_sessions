            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code (`code_00.py`) aimed to implement the transformation logic derived from the initial examples. The logic involves checking the first element of the sequence: if it's 0, move that element to the end; otherwise, find the first 0 and move the element immediately preceding it to the end.\n\nThe error reported across all examples (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\") strongly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array as input, and a comparison involving this array (or a slice of it) is being used in a boolean context (like an `if` statement) where a single True/False value is expected.\n\nThe provided code (`code_00.py`) explicitly converts the input sequence to a Python list (`working_list = list(input_sequence)`) at the beginning. Theoretically, this should prevent the NumPy ambiguity error within the function's subsequent logic, as operations like `first_element = working_list[0]` and `if first_element == 0:` would then use standard Python integers and lists.\n\nGiven that the error occurred despite this list conversion, there are a few possibilities:\n1.  The test harness environment has specifics about NumPy interaction that aren't captured by simple list conversion.\n2.  The error originates *outside* the provided `transform` function, perhaps in how the test harness prepares the input or validates the output.\n3.  The input might be structured differently than assumed (e.g., a multi-dimensional array, though unlikely based on examples).\n\nHowever, adhering to the instruction to refine based on the provided information, the strategy is to ensure the implementation is robust, assuming the input *is* a NumPy array and the error *is* related to its handling within the function's scope. This involves ensuring that any value used in a condition check is explicitly a scalar Python type. The core transformation logic derived previously appears correct for all examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be `numpy.ndarray` based on the error message.\n*   **Input Shape:** Consistently a 1-dimensional array (vector) of length 12 in all training examples.\n*   **Element Type:** Integers (specifically single digits 0-9).\n*   **Error Consistency:** The same NumPy ambiguity error occurred for all 7 training examples and the test example, suggesting the issue is fundamental to the input type handling, not specific data values.\n*   **Logical Correctness:** The intended logic (move first element if 0, else move element before first 0) correctly maps input to output for all 7 training examples when simulated manually.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
