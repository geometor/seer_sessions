"""
Processes a sequence of integers represented as a space-separated string.
The transformation rule depends on the value of the first element in the sequence:
1. If the first element is 0:
   - Remove the first element (0) and append it to the end of the sequence.
2. If the first element is not 0:
   - Find the index of the first occurrence of 0 in the sequence.
   - Remove the element immediately preceding the first 0.
   - Append the removed element to the end of the sequence.
The modified sequence is returned as a space-separated string.
