objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list or numpy.ndarray # Adjusted type based on error
    properties:
      - elements: list[int]
      - length: int (observed constant at 12)
  - name: element
    type: int
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - index: int (position in the sequence)
  - name: first_element
    type: element
    description: The element at index 0 of the input sequence.
  - name: first_zero
    type: element
    description: The element with value 0 having the minimum index in the input sequence.
  - name: target_element
    type: element
    description: The specific element that is moved during the transformation.
  - name: target_index
    type: int
    description: The index of the target_element in the original sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_first_element
    description: Get the element at index 0.
  - name: find_first_zero_index
    description: Find the index of the first occurrence of the element 0. Assumes 0 is always present based on examples.
  - name: determine_target
    description: >
      Based on the value of the first_element, determine the target_element and its target_index.
      If first_element == 0, target_index is 0.
      If first_element != 0, target_index is (find_first_zero_index - 1).
  - name: remove_element_at_index
    description: Remove the element from the sequence at the specified target_index.
  - name: append_element
    description: Add the removed target_element to the end of the sequence.

relationships:
  - type: conditional_dependency
    subject: target_index
    condition: value of first_element
    description: >
      If the first_element value is 0, the target_index is 0.
      If the first_element value is not 0, the target_index is the index immediately preceding the first occurrence of 0.
  - type: transformation
    input: input_sequence (list or ndarray)
    output: output_sequence (list or ndarray)
    process: Determine the target_element based on the first element's value, remove it from its original position, and append it to the end of the sequence.
