objects:
  - input_sequence: A list or array of single-digit integers.
  - output_sequence: A list or array of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  - element_to_move: The integer located at the first position (index 0) of the input_sequence.

properties:
  - length: The number of elements in the sequence (constant between input and output).
  - first_element_index: Always 0.

actions:
  - identify_first_element: Get the element at index 0 of the input_sequence.
  - remove_first_element: Create a new sequence by taking all elements from index 1 onwards from the input_sequence.
  - append_element: Add the identified first element to the end of the new sequence.

relationships:
  - transformation_rule: The output_sequence is formed by removing the first element from the input_sequence and appending it to the end.
