objects:
  - input_sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
  - output_sequence: A list of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  - element: An individual integer within the sequence.
  - zero: The integer 0.
  - non_zero_element: An integer other than 0.

properties:
  - length: The number of elements in the sequence (constant between input and output).
  - index: The position (0-based) of an element in the sequence.
  - first_zero_index: The index of the first occurrence of 0. Can be -1 if no zeros exist.
  - first_non_zero_index: The index of the first occurrence of a non-zero element. Can be -1 if all elements are zero.
  - index_to_move: The calculated index of the element selected for relocation.
  - element_to_move: The value of the element at the `index_to_move`.

actions:
  - find_first_index: Locate the index of the first occurrence of a specific element (0) or type (non-zero).
  - determine_index_to_move: Calculate the `index_to_move` based on `first_zero_index` and `first_non_zero_index`.
  - remove_element_at_index: Delete the element from its calculated original position (`index_to_move`).
  - append_element: Add the removed element to the end of the sequence.

relationships:
  - transformation_rule: Defines how the `input_sequence` is modified to produce the `output_sequence`.
    - The element at `index_to_move` is removed and appended to the end.
    - `index_to_move` is determined conditionally:
        - If `first_zero_index` is greater than 0, `index_to_move` is `first_zero_index - 1`.
        - Else if `first_zero_index` is 0:
            - If `first_non_zero_index` is greater than 0, `index_to_move` is `first_non_zero_index - 1`.
            - Else (`first_non_zero_index` is 0 or -1), `index_to_move` is 0.
        - Else (`first_zero_index` is -1, meaning no zeros), `index_to_move` is 0.
