objects:
  - input_sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
  - output_sequence: A list of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  - element: An individual integer within the sequence.
  - zero: The integer 0.
  - non_zero_element: An integer other than 0.

properties:
  - length: The number of elements in the sequence (constant between input and output).
  - count_of_zeros: The total number of zeros in the input sequence.
  - count_of_unique_non_zeros: The number of distinct non-zero integers in the input sequence.
  - index_of_first_zero: The position (0-based index) of the first occurrence of 0 in the input sequence.
  - index_to_move: The position (0-based index) of the element selected for relocation.
  - element_to_move: The value of the element at the `index_to_move`.

actions:
  - count_elements: Determine the frequency of specific elements (like 0) or categories (like unique non-zeros).
  - find_first_index: Locate the index of the first occurrence of a specific element (like 0).
  - identify_element_to_move: Determine which element needs to be relocated based on sequence properties.
  - remove_element_at_index: Delete the element from its original position.
  - append_element: Add the removed element to the end of the sequence.

relationships:
  - transformation_rule: Defines how the `input_sequence` is modified to produce the `output_sequence`. The rule depends conditionally on `count_of_zeros`, `count_of_unique_non_zeros`, and `index_of_first_zero`.
