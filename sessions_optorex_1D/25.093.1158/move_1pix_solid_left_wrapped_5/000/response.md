**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming an input sequence of single-digit integers into an output sequence of the same length. The transformation appears to be a reordering operation where a single element from the input sequence is removed from its original position and appended to the end. The core challenge lies in identifying which specific element needs to be moved based on the properties of the input sequence. The properties influencing the choice of the element seem related to the counts of zero and unique non-zero elements within the sequence, and potentially the position of the first zero.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
  - output_sequence: A list of single-digit integers derived from the input.
  - element: An individual integer within the sequence.
  - zero: The integer 0.
  - non_zero_element: An integer other than 0.

properties:
  - length: The number of elements in the sequence (constant between input and output).
  - count_of_zeros: The total number of zeros in the input sequence.
  - count_of_unique_non_zeros: The number of distinct non-zero integers in the input sequence.
  - index_of_first_zero: The position (0-based index) of the first occurrence of 0 in the input sequence.
  - index_to_move: The position (0-based index) of the element selected for relocation.
  - element_to_move: The value of the element at the `index_to_move`.

actions:
  - count_elements: Determine the frequency of specific elements (like 0) or categories (like unique non-zeros).
  - find_first_index: Locate the index of the first occurrence of a specific element (like 0).
  - identify_element_to_move: Determine which element needs to be relocated based on sequence properties.
  - remove_element_at_index: Delete the element from its original position.
  - append_element: Add the removed element to the end of the sequence.

relationships:
  - transformation_rule: Defines how the `input_sequence` is modified to produce the `output_sequence`. The rule depends conditionally on `count_of_zeros`, `count_of_unique_non_zeros`, and `index_of_first_zero`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the `input_sequence` of integers.
2.  Calculate the `count_of_unique_non_zeros` by finding how many distinct integers greater than zero are present in the `input_sequence`.
3.  Calculate the `count_of_zeros` by counting the occurrences of the integer 0 in the `input_sequence`.
4.  Initialize `index_to_move` to 0.
5.  Check if `count_of_unique_non_zeros` is exactly 1 AND `count_of_zeros` is exactly 2.
6.  If the condition in step 5 is true:
    a.  Find the `index_of_first_zero` in the `input_sequence`.
    b.  Set `index_to_move` to `index_of_first_zero - 1`.
7.  Identify the `element_to_move` located at the determined `index_to_move` in the `input_sequence`.
8.  Create a new sequence by removing the element at `index_to_move` from the `input_sequence`.
9.  Append the `element_to_move` to the end of the new sequence.
10. Return the modified sequence as the `output_sequence`.
