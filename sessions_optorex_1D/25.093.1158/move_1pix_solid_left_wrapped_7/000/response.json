            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\nThe input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. The core transformation seems to involve locating the first non-zero digit (or the block it belongs to) and shifting or swapping elements based on its position. Zeros act as placeholders or space. The length of the sequence remains constant.\n\nTwo distinct patterns emerge based on the position of the *first* non-zero element:\n\n1.  **First Non-Zero Element is NOT at the Beginning (Index > 0):** The first non-zero element is swapped with the element immediately preceding it (which is always a zero in the examples). See `train_2`, `train_4`, `train_5`, `train_6`.\n2.  **First Non-Zero Element IS at the Beginning (Index 0):** The transformation is more complex. It involves the *end* of the initial block of non-zero numbers and the position *before* the *next* block of non-zero numbers. Specifically, the element at the end index of the first block swaps with the zero located just before the start of the second non-zero block. See `train_1`, `train_3`, `train_7`.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
