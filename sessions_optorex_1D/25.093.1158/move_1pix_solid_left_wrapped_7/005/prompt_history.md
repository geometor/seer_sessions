Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. The core transformation seems to involve locating the first non-zero digit (or the block it belongs to) and shifting or swapping elements based on its position. Zeros act as placeholders or space. The length of the sequence remains constant.

Two distinct patterns emerge based on the position of the *first* non-zero element:

1.  **First Non-Zero Element is NOT at the Beginning (Index > 0):** The first non-zero element is swapped with the element immediately preceding it (which is always a zero in the examples). See `train_2`, `train_4`, `train_5`, `train_6`.
2.  **First Non-Zero Element IS at the Beginning (Index 0):** The transformation is more complex. It involves the *end* of the initial block of non-zero numbers and the position *before* the *next* block of non-zero numbers. Specifically, the element at the end index of the first block swaps with the zero located just before the start of the second non-zero block. See `train_1`, `train_3`, `train_7`.

**Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Properties:
    - Contains single-digit integers (0-9)
    - Fixed length

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as input
    - Derived from input via element rearrangement

Objects:
  - Sequence: The list of integers.
  - Element: An individual integer within the sequence.
  - NonZeroElement: An element with a value > 0.
  - ZeroElement: An element with a value == 0.
  - Block: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroElements.

Relationships:
  - Position: Index of an element within the sequence.
  - PrecedingElement: Element at index `i-1` relative to element at index `i`.
  - FollowingElement: Element at index `i+1` relative to element at index `i`.
  - FirstNonZero: The NonZeroElement with the lowest index.
  - FirstBlock: The Block containing the FirstNonZero element (if it's part of a block starting at index 0) or just the FirstNonZero element itself.
  - NextBlock: The first Block of NonZeroElements occurring after the FirstBlock.

Actions:
  - FindIndex: Locate the index of the FirstNonZero element.
  - FindBlockEnd: Determine the last index of a contiguous Block.
  - FindNextBlockStart: Determine the starting index of the NextBlock.
  - CheckValue: Verify if an element at a given index is zero.
  - Swap: Exchange the positions of two elements in the sequence.

TransformationRule:
  - Condition: Based on the index of the FirstNonZero element.
  - Case 1 (FirstNonZero at Index > 0):
    - Action: Swap the FirstNonZero element with its PrecedingElement.
  - Case 2 (FirstNonZero at Index 0):
    - Find the end index (`end_idx`) of the FirstBlock.
    - Find the start index (`next_start_idx`) of the NextBlock.
    - Check if NextBlock exists and if the element at `next_start_idx - 1` is a ZeroElement.
    - Action (if condition met): Swap the element at `end_idx` with the element at `next_start_idx - 1`.
    - Action (otherwise - although not explicitly shown in examples, implies no change or a default behavior if conditions aren't met): The sequence remains unchanged or follows a different rule not covered. Based on provided examples, the condition is always met for Case 2.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the sequence to find the index (`first_nz_idx`) of the first non-zero element. If no non-zero element exists, return the original sequence.
3.  **If `first_nz_idx` is greater than 0:**
    a.  Swap the element at `first_nz_idx` with the element at `first_nz_idx - 1`.
4.  **If `first_nz_idx` is 0:**
    a.  Identify the value (`val`) of the element at index 0.
    b.  Find the index (`end_idx`) of the last element in the initial contiguous block of `val` starting at index 0.
    c.  Search for the start index (`next_block_start_idx`) of the *next* contiguous block of *any* non-zero number that occurs after `end_idx`.
    d.  If such a `next_block_start_idx` is found AND the element at index `next_block_start_idx - 1` is 0:
        i.  Swap the element at `end_idx` with the element at `next_block_start_idx - 1`.
    e.  (If the condition in 4d is not met, no change occurs based on the examples provided).
5.  Return the modified sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The core issue appears to be a data type mismatch or incorrect handling during execution, specifically the `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This indicates that a NumPy array (or similar structure) was used in a context expecting a single boolean value (like `if array:`). This likely happened either because the input data (strings) was converted to NumPy arrays unintentionally or because some operation within the previous code attempt resulted in an array where a simple boolean or integer comparison was needed.

The transformation logic derived previously, involving two cases based on the position of the first non-zero element, seems consistent across all provided training examples when manually checked.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Ensure Correct Input Parsing:** The input examples are given as space-separated strings. The transformation logic assumes a list of integers. The first step must be to parse the input string into a `list[int]`.
2.  **Pure Python List Operations:** The `transform` function and its helpers should operate exclusively on standard Python lists and integers. Avoid NumPy unless explicitly required and handled correctly, which doesn't seem necessary for this task.
3.  **Refine Helper Functions:** Ensure helper functions like `find_first_nonzero_index`, `find_block_end`, and `find_next_block_start` correctly handle list indices and return values compatible with standard Python conditional checks (`if index != -1:`, `if list[index] == 0:` etc.).
4.  **Re-verify Logic:** Reconfirm the two main transformation rules with the parsed list data structures.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's parse the inputs/outputs and verify the indices involved in the transformations.

**Correction during Metrics Gathering:**

The automated analysis reveals a mismatch in **Example 4**.
*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   First Non-Zero Index: 6.
*   Rule 1 (Swap first non-zero with preceding): Swap index 6 (`7`) with index 5 (`0`).
*   Simulation: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Actual Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

The simulation based on Rule 1 is incorrect for Example 4. The actual output shifts *both* `7`s one position to the left. This suggests that Rule 1 might apply to the *entire block* containing the first non-zero element, not just the single element itself.

Let's re-evaluate Rule 1: "If the first non-zero element is at index `i > 0`, swap the element at `i` with the element at `i-1`."

Revised Rule 1 Hypothesis: "If the first non-zero element is at index `i > 0`, find the contiguous block of this non-zero value starting at index `i`. Swap this entire block with the element at index `i-1` (which must be zero)." This seems overly complex (swapping a block with a single element).

Alternative Revised Rule 1 Hypothesis: "If the first non-zero element is at index `i > 0`, find the element value `v` at index `i`. Find the start index `start_idx` and end index `end_idx` of the contiguous block of `v` that includes index `i`. Swap the element at `start_idx` with the element at `start_idx - 1`." Let's test this:

*   **Example 2:** `[0, ..., 0, 7]`. First non-zero at 11. Block start=11, end=11. Swap index 11 with index 10. -> `[0, ..., 7, 0]`. Matches.
*   **Example 4:** `[..., 0, 7, 7, 0, ...]`. First non-zero at 6. Block start=6, end=7. Swap index 6 with index 5. -> `[..., 7, 0, 7, 0, ...]`. **Still doesn't match.**
*   **Example 5:** `[..., 0, 3, 0, ...]`. First non-zero at 6. Block start=6, end=6. Swap index 6 with index 5. -> `[..., 3, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.
*   **Example 6:** `[..., 0, 2, 0, ...]`. First non-zero at 8. Block start=8, end=8. Swap index 8 with index 7. -> `[..., 2, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.

It seems Example 4 is the anomaly for Rule 1. The output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` looks like the *entire block* `[7, 7]` shifted left by one position, overwriting the zero at index 5 and leaving a zero at index 7. This is more like a "shift left" operation for the first block if it doesn't start at index 0.

Let's define the rules again:

*   **Rule 1 (First non-zero index `i > 0`):** Identify the contiguous block of non-zero values starting at index `i`. Let this block be from `i` to `j`. Shift this entire block one position to the left, so it now occupies indices `i-1` to `j-1`. The element originally at index `j` moves to `j-1`, `j-1` moves to `j-2`, ..., `i` moves to `i-1`. The original value at `i-1` (which must be 0) effectively moves to index `j`.
*   **Rule 2 (First non-zero index `i = 0`):** Identify the contiguous block of the starting non-zero value. Let it end at index `j`. Find the start index `k` of the *next* non-zero block. If such a block exists and the element at index `k-1` is 0, swap the element at index `j` with the element at index `k-1`.

Testing Rule 1 (Revised Shift Logic):
*   **Example 2:** `[..., 0, 7]`. Block `[7]` at index 11. Shift left. -> `[..., 7, 0]`. Matches.
*   **Example 4:** `[..., 0, 7, 7, 0, ...]`. Block `[7, 7]` at indices 6-7. Shift left. Element at 7 moves to 6, element at 6 moves to 5. Original element at 5 (0) moves to 7. -> `[..., 7, 7, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.
*   **Example 5:** `[..., 0, 3, 0, ...]`. Block `[3]` at index 6. Shift left. -> `[..., 3, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.
*   **Example 6:** `[..., 0, 2, 0, ...]`. Block `[2]` at index 8. Shift left. -> `[..., 2, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.

This revised Rule 1 (block shift left) works for all relevant examples. Rule 2 remains the same (swap end of first block with zero before next block).

```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation (Revised)

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated single-digit integers.
  Processing: Must be parsed into a List of Integers.

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as input list.
    - Derived from input via element rearrangement based on specific rules.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The list of integers derived from the input string.
  - Element: An individual integer within the sequence.
  - NonZeroElement: An element with a value > 0.
  - ZeroElement: An element with a value == 0.
  - Block: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroElements OR any NonZeroElements depending on context.
    - FirstBlock: The first contiguous Block of NonZeroElements encountered when scanning from left to right.
    - NextBlock: The first contiguous Block of any NonZeroElements occurring after the FirstBlock (separated by at least one ZeroElement).

Properties_of_Interest:
  - FirstNonZeroIndex: The index `i` of the first NonZeroElement. Returns -1 if none exists.
  - FirstBlockStartIndex: The starting index of the FirstBlock. (Same as FirstNonZeroIndex if it exists and > -1).
  - FirstBlockEndIndex: The ending index `j` (inclusive) of the FirstBlock.
  - NextBlockStartIndex: The starting index `k` of the NextBlock. Returns -1 if none exists.
  - ElementValue: The integer value of an element at a specific index.

Actions:
  - ParseInput: Convert the input string into a list of integers.
  - FindFirstNonZeroIndex: Locate the index `i`.
  - FindBlockIndices: Determine the start (`i`) and end (`j`) indices of the FirstBlock.
  - FindNextBlockStartIndex: Determine the start index `k` of the NextBlock.
  - CheckPrecedingElement: Verify if the element at index `i-1` exists and is zero (for Rule 1). Verify if element at `k-1` exists and is zero (for Rule 2).
  - BlockShiftLeft: For Rule 1. Move the elements from index `i` to `j` one position left (to `i-1` through `j-1`). Place the original element at `i-1` (zero) into index `j`.
  - Swap: For Rule 2. Exchange the positions of the element at `j` and the element at `k-1`.

TransformationRule:
  - Handle Empty/All-Zero Case: If FirstNonZeroIndex is -1, return the list unchanged.
  - Condition: Based on the FirstNonZeroIndex `i`.
  - Case 1 (FirstNonZeroIndex `i` > 0):
    - Find the FirstBlockEndIndex `j` starting from `i`.
    - Perform BlockShiftLeft operation for indices `i` through `j`.
  - Case 2 (FirstNonZeroIndex `i` == 0):
    - Find the FirstBlockEndIndex `j` starting from `i=0`.
    - Find the NextBlockStartIndex `k` searching from index `j+1`.
    - If `k` is found AND `k-1` is a valid index AND the element at `k-1` is 0:
        - Perform Swap operation between index `j` and index `k-1`.
    - Else (no next block, or element before it isn't zero): Return the list unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  Parse the input string of space-separated digits into a list of integers (`sequence`).
2.  Create a mutable copy of the `sequence` called `output_sequence`.
3.  Find the index (`first_nz_idx`) of the first non-zero element in `output_sequence`.
4.  **If `first_nz_idx` is -1 (no non-zero elements):**
    a.  Return `output_sequence` as is.
5.  **If `first_nz_idx` is greater than 0:**
    a.  Identify the value `val` of the element at `first_nz_idx`.
    b.  Find the end index (`end_idx`) of the contiguous block of `val` starting at `first_nz_idx`.
    c.  Store the zero element currently at `first_nz_idx - 1`.
    d.  Shift each element from `first_nz_idx` up to and including `end_idx` one position to the left (i.e., move element at index `x` to index `x-1`).
    e.  Place the stored zero element (from step 5c) into the position at `end_idx`.
6.  **If `first_nz_idx` is 0:**
    a.  Identify the value `val` of the element at index 0.
    b.  Find the end index (`first_block_end_idx`) of the initial contiguous block of `val` starting at index 0.
    c.  Search for the start index (`next_block_start_idx`) of the *next* contiguous block of *any* non-zero number that occurs *after* `first_block_end_idx`.
    d.  **If `next_block_start_idx` is found (is not -1):**
        i.  Calculate the index immediately preceding the next block: `zero_idx = next_block_start_idx - 1`.
        ii. **If `zero_idx` is a valid index (>= 0) AND the element at `output_sequence[zero_idx]` is 0:**
            1.  Swap the element at `first_block_end_idx` with the element at `zero_idx` in `output_sequence`.
7.  Return the modified `output_sequence`.
