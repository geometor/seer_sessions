            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe execution results indicate a fundamental type mismatch error occurring consistently across all examples. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" strongly suggests that the `transform` function, or its helpers, received the input data in a format it wasn't designed for (likely a raw string or potentially a NumPy array instead of a simple list of integers) and attempted a boolean comparison on it.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this involves:\n1.  **Input Preprocessing:** Explicitly parse the input string (assuming that's the format based on the initial problem description) into a `list` of `int` at the beginning of the `transform` function.\n2.  **Logic Re-evaluation:** Re-examine the transformation logic based on the examples, paying close attention to the difference between single-element swaps and block shifts. The previous analysis identified two primary cases, but the action for Case 1 (first non-zero not at index 0) needs refinement. Examples `train_4`, `train_5`, and `train_6` show a *left shift* of the first non-zero block, not just a swap of the first element. Case 2 (first non-zero at index 0) appears to be correctly identified as a specific swap.\n3.  **Code Modification:** Update the Python code to include input parsing and implement the corrected logic for both cases.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's re-analyze the examples assuming the input is correctly parsed into a list of integers.\n\n"
