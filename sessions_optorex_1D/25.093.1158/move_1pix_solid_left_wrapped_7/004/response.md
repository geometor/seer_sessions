**General Assessment:**

The core issue appears to be a data type mismatch or incorrect handling during execution, specifically the `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous`. This indicates that a NumPy array (or similar structure) was used in a context expecting a single boolean value (like `if array:`). This likely happened either because the input data (strings) was converted to NumPy arrays unintentionally or because some operation within the previous code attempt resulted in an array where a simple boolean or integer comparison was needed.

The transformation logic derived previously, involving two cases based on the position of the first non-zero element, seems consistent across all provided training examples when manually checked.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Ensure Correct Input Parsing:** The input examples are given as space-separated strings. The transformation logic assumes a list of integers. The first step must be to parse the input string into a `list[int]`.
2.  **Pure Python List Operations:** The `transform` function and its helpers should operate exclusively on standard Python lists and integers. Avoid NumPy unless explicitly required and handled correctly, which doesn't seem necessary for this task.
3.  **Refine Helper Functions:** Ensure helper functions like `find_first_nonzero_index`, `find_block_end`, and `find_next_block_start` correctly handle list indices and return values compatible with standard Python conditional checks (`if index != -1:`, `if list[index] == 0:` etc.).
4.  **Re-verify Logic:** Reconfirm the two main transformation rules with the parsed list data structures.

**Metrics Gathering:**

**Correction during Metrics Gathering:**

The automated analysis reveals a mismatch in **Example 4**.
*   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   First Non-Zero Index: 6.
*   Rule 1 (Swap first non-zero with preceding): Swap index 6 (`7`) with index 5 (`0`).
*   Simulation: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
*   Actual Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

The simulation based on Rule 1 is incorrect for Example 4. The actual output shifts *both* `7`s one position to the left. This suggests that Rule 1 might apply to the *entire block* containing the first non-zero element, not just the single element itself.

Let's re-evaluate Rule 1: "If the first non-zero element is at index `i > 0`, swap the element at `i` with the element at `i-1`."

Revised Rule 1 Hypothesis: "If the first non-zero element is at index `i > 0`, find the contiguous block of this non-zero value starting at index `i`. Swap this entire block with the element at index `i-1` (which must be zero)." This seems overly complex (swapping a block with a single element).

Alternative Revised Rule 1 Hypothesis: "If the first non-zero element is at index `i > 0`, find the element value `v` at index `i`. Find the start index `start_idx` and end index `end_idx` of the contiguous block of `v` that includes index `i`. Swap the element at `start_idx` with the element at `start_idx - 1`." Let's test this:

*   **Example 2:** `[0, ..., 0, 7]`. First non-zero at 11. Block start=11, end=11. Swap index 11 with index 10. -> `[0, ..., 7, 0]`. Matches.
*   **Example 4:** `[..., 0, 7, 7, 0, ...]`. First non-zero at 6. Block start=6, end=7. Swap index 6 with index 5. -> `[..., 7, 0, 7, 0, ...]`. **Still doesn't match.**
*   **Example 5:** `[..., 0, 3, 0, ...]`. First non-zero at 6. Block start=6, end=6. Swap index 6 with index 5. -> `[..., 3, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.
*   **Example 6:** `[..., 0, 2, 0, ...]`. First non-zero at 8. Block start=8, end=8. Swap index 8 with index 7. -> `[..., 2, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.

It seems Example 4 is the anomaly for Rule 1. The output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` looks like the *entire block* `[7, 7]` shifted left by one position, overwriting the zero at index 5 and leaving a zero at index 7. This is more like a "shift left" operation for the first block if it doesn't start at index 0.

Let's define the rules again:

*   **Rule 1 (First non-zero index `i > 0`):** Identify the contiguous block of non-zero values starting at index `i`. Let this block be from `i` to `j`. Shift this entire block one position to the left, so it now occupies indices `i-1` to `j-1`. The element originally at index `j` moves to `j-1`, `j-1` moves to `j-2`, ..., `i` moves to `i-1`. The original value at `i-1` (which must be 0) effectively moves to index `j`.
*   **Rule 2 (First non-zero index `i = 0`):** Identify the contiguous block of the starting non-zero value. Let it end at index `j`. Find the start index `k` of the *next* non-zero block. If such a block exists and the element at index `k-1` is 0, swap the element at index `j` with the element at index `k-1`.

Testing Rule 1 (Revised Shift Logic):
*   **Example 2:** `[..., 0, 7]`. Block `[7]` at index 11. Shift left. -> `[..., 7, 0]`. Matches.
*   **Example 4:** `[..., 0, 7, 7, 0, ...]`. Block `[7, 7]` at indices 6-7. Shift left. Element at 7 moves to 6, element at 6 moves to 5. Original element at 5 (0) moves to 7. -> `[..., 7, 7, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.
*   **Example 5:** `[..., 0, 3, 0, ...]`. Block `[3]` at index 6. Shift left. -> `[..., 3, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.
*   **Example 6:** `[..., 0, 2, 0, ...]`. Block `[2]` at index 8. Shift left. -> `[..., 2, 0, 0, ...]`. Matches.

This revised Rule 1 (block shift left) works for all relevant examples. Rule 2 remains the same (swap end of first block with zero before next block).

```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation (Revised)

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated single-digit integers.
  Processing: Must be parsed into a List of Integers.

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as input list.
    - Derived from input via element rearrangement based on specific rules.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The list of integers derived from the input string.
  - Element: An individual integer within the sequence.
  - NonZeroElement: An element with a value > 0.
  - ZeroElement: An element with a value == 0.
  - Block: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroElements OR any NonZeroElements depending on context.
    - FirstBlock: The first contiguous Block of NonZeroElements encountered when scanning from left to right.
    - NextBlock: The first contiguous Block of any NonZeroElements occurring after the FirstBlock (separated by at least one ZeroElement).

Properties_of_Interest:
  - FirstNonZeroIndex: The index `i` of the first NonZeroElement. Returns -1 if none exists.
  - FirstBlockStartIndex: The starting index of the FirstBlock. (Same as FirstNonZeroIndex if it exists and > -1).
  - FirstBlockEndIndex: The ending index `j` (inclusive) of the FirstBlock.
  - NextBlockStartIndex: The starting index `k` of the NextBlock. Returns -1 if none exists.
  - ElementValue: The integer value of an element at a specific index.

Actions:
  - ParseInput: Convert the input string into a list of integers.
  - FindFirstNonZeroIndex: Locate the index `i`.

  - BlockShiftLeft: For Rule 1. Move the elements from index `i` to `j` one position left (to `i-1` through `j-1`). Place the original element at `i-1` (zero) into index `j`.
  - Swap: For Rule 2. Exchange the positions of the element at `j` and the element at `k-1`.

TransformationRule:
  - Handle Empty/All-Zero Case: If FirstNonZeroIndex is -1, return the list unchanged.
  - Condition: Based on the FirstNonZeroIndex `i`.
  - Case 1 (FirstNonZeroIndex `i` > 0):
    - Find the FirstBlockEndIndex `j` starting from `i`.
    - Perform BlockShiftLeft operation for indices `i` through `j`.
  - Case 2 (FirstNonZeroIndex `i` == 0):
    - Find the FirstBlockEndIndex `j` starting from `i=0`.
    - Find the NextBlockStartIndex `k` searching from index `j+1`.
    - If `k` is found AND `k-1` is a valid index AND the element at `k-1` is 0:
        - Perform Swap operation between index `j` and index `k-1`.
    - Else (no next block, or element before it isn't zero): Return the list unchanged.

**Natural Language Program (Revised):**

1.  Parse the input string of space-separated digits into a list of integers (`sequence`).
2.  Create a mutable copy of the `sequence` called `output_sequence`.
3.  Find the index (`first_nz_idx`) of the first non-zero element in `output_sequence`.
4.  **If `first_nz_idx` is -1 (no non-zero elements):**
    a.  Return `output_sequence` as is.
5.  **If `first_nz_idx` is greater than 0:**
    a.  Identify the value `val` of the element at `first_nz_idx`.
    b.  Find the end index (`end_idx`) of the contiguous block of `val` starting at `first_nz_idx`.
    c.  Store the zero element currently at `first_nz_idx - 1`.
    d.  Shift each element from `first_nz_idx` up to and including `end_idx` one position to the left (i.e., move element at index `x` to index `x-1`).
    e.  Place the stored zero element (from step 5c) into the position at `end_idx`.
6.  **If `first_nz_idx` is 0:**
    a.  Identify the value `val` of the element at index 0.
    b.  Find the end index (`first_block_end_idx`) of the initial contiguous block of `val` starting at index 0.
    c.  Search for the start index (`next_block_start_idx`) of the *next* contiguous block of *any* non-zero number that occurs *after* `first_block_end_idx`.
    d.  **If `next_block_start_idx` is found (is not -1):**
        i.  Calculate the index immediately preceding the next block: `zero_idx = next_block_start_idx - 1`.
        ii. **If `zero_idx` is a valid index (>= 0) AND the element at `output_sequence[zero_idx]` is 0:**
            1.  Swap the element at `first_block_end_idx` with the element at `zero_idx` in `output_sequence`.
7.  Return the modified `output_sequence`.
