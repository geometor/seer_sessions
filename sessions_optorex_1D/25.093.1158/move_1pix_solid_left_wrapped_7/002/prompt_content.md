"""
Transforms a sequence of integers based on the position of the first non-zero element.

1. If the first non-zero element is not at the beginning (index > 0), swap it with the preceding element (which is expected to be zero based on examples).
2. If the first non-zero element is at the beginning (index 0):
   a. Find the end of the initial contiguous block of this non-zero number.
   b. Find the start of the next block of any non-zero number occurring after the first block.
   c. If such a next block exists and the element immediately preceding it is zero, swap the element at the end of the first block with the zero preceding the next block.
3. If no non-zero elements exist, the sequence remains unchanged.
