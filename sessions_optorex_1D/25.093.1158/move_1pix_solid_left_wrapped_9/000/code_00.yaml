objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of digits
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of digits
  - name: first_element
    type: digit
    description: The digit at the first position (index 0) of the input_sequence.
properties:
  - name: sequence_length
    description: The number of digits in a sequence. It remains constant between input and output.
  - name: relative_order
    description: The order of elements relative to each other, excluding the first element. This is preserved.
actions:
  - name: identify_first_element
    input: input_sequence
    output: first_element
    description: Get the digit at the first position of the input sequence.
  - name: remove_first_element
    input: input_sequence
    output: modified_sequence
    description: Create a new sequence containing all elements of the input_sequence except the first one.
  - name: append_element
    input: 
      - modified_sequence
      - first_element
    output: output_sequence
    description: Add the first_element to the end of the modified_sequence.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The output_sequence is formed by taking the first_element of the input_sequence and appending it to the end of the sequence formed by the remaining elements.
  - type: positional_shift
    description: All elements except the first shift one position to the left in the output sequence compared to their position in the input sequence.
  - type: element_conservation
    description: All digits present in the input_sequence are also present in the output_sequence, with the same frequency.
