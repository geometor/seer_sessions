objects:
  - name: input_string
    type: string
    description: A string containing space-separated single-digit integers.
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    description: A string containing space-separated single-digit integers, representing the transformed sequence.
  - name: integer_sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: A sequence derived by parsing the input_string or used to generate the output_string.
  - name: first_element
    type: integer
    description: The integer at the first position (index 0) of the integer_sequence derived from the input_string.
properties:
  - name: sequence_length
    description: The number of integers in the sequence. It remains constant between input and output. Based on examples, length is 12.
  - name: relative_order
    description: The order of elements relative to each other, excluding the first element, is preserved in the integer_sequence transformation.
relationships:
  - type: parsing
    from: input_string
    to: integer_sequence
    rule: Split the input_string by spaces and convert each resulting substring to an integer.
  - type: transformation
    from: integer_sequence (derived from input)
    to: integer_sequence (for output)
    rule: The output integer_sequence is formed by taking the first_element of the input integer_sequence and appending it to the end of the sequence formed by the remaining elements (elements from index 1 onwards).
  - type: formatting
    from: integer_sequence (for output)
    to: output_string
    rule: Convert each integer in the sequence to its string representation and join them with single spaces.
  - type: element_conservation
    description: All digits represented in the input_string are also present in the output_string, with the same frequency.
