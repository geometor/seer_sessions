objects:
  - name: input_string
    type: string
    description: A string containing digits separated by single spaces.
  - name: intermediate_list
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence of numbers obtained after parsing the input_string.
  - name: first_element
    type: integer
    description: The number at the first position (index 0) of the intermediate_list.
  - name: remaining_elements_list
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence containing all elements of intermediate_list except the first one.
  - name: output_list
    type: list of integers
    description: The sequence formed by appending first_element to remaining_elements_list.
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    description: The final output string, formed by formatting output_list with space separators.
properties:
  - name: sequence_length
    description: The number of digits/integers in the sequence. Remains constant throughout the process.
  - name: element_type
    description: Elements are single-digit integers.
actions:
  - name: parse_string
    input: input_string
    output: intermediate_list
    description: Split the input_string by spaces and convert each part to an integer.
  - name: check_length
    input: intermediate_list
    output: boolean
    description: Determine if the list has fewer than 2 elements. If so, the list remains unchanged.
  - name: identify_and_split
    input: intermediate_list
    output:
      - first_element
      - remaining_elements_list
    description: Separate the element at index 0 from the rest of the list (elements from index 1 onwards). Applicable only if length is 2 or more.
  - name: construct_output_list
    input:
      - remaining_elements_list
      - first_element
    output: output_list
    description: Create a new list by appending the first_element to the end of the remaining_elements_list.
  - name: format_list
    input: output_list
    output: output_string
    description: Convert each integer in the output_list back to a string and join them with single spaces.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_string
    to: output_string
    rule: The output string is generated by parsing the input string into a list of numbers, moving the first number to the end of the list, and then formatting the modified list back into a space-separated string.
  - type: positional_shift (rotation)
    description: The first element moves to the last position. All other elements shift one position towards the beginning.
  - type: element_conservation
    description: All numbers present in the input are preserved in the output, maintaining their counts.
