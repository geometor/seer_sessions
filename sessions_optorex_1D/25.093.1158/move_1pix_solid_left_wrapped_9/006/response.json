            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided examples demonstrate a consistent transformation pattern across different sequences of digits. The previous code implementation failed because it likely assumed the input was a simple Python list or string, while the execution environment passed a NumPy array. The error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\" confirms this mismatch, occurring when a boolean check was performed directly on the NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the understanding and the natural language program to explicitly handle the input as a row within a 2D structure (even if it's just one row, as seen in the examples). The core transformation logic\u2014moving the first element of the sequence to the end\u2014remains the same but needs to be applied correctly to the elements *within* the input row (NumPy array).\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the examples and the code execution results:\n\n*   **Input/Output Type:** The data is structured as 2D NumPy arrays.\n*   **Dimensions:** All provided training examples have input and output arrays with a shape of `(1, 12)`, meaning 1 row and 12 columns.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation acts *horizontally* along the single row.\n*   **Element Conservation:** The multiset of elements in the input row is identical to the multiset of elements in the output row.\n*   **Consistency:** The rotational shift (first element moves to the end) applies consistently across all examples.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
