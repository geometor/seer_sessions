objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: 2D NumPy array
    description: A grid structure containing digits. In observed examples, it always has 1 row.
  - name: output_grid
    type: 2D NumPy array
    description: The resulting grid after transformation. Has the same dimensions as the input_grid.
  - name: grid_row
    type: 1D NumPy array
    description: A single row extracted from the input_grid.
  - name: first_element
    type: digit (integer)
    description: The element at the first position (index 0) of the grid_row.
properties:
  - name: grid_shape
    description: The dimensions (rows, columns) of the grid. Remains constant between input and output. Examples show (1, 12).
  - name: row_length
    description: The number of elements in a row. Remains constant. Examples show 12.
  - name: relative_order
    description: The order of elements relative to each other within the row, excluding the first element. This is preserved during the shift.
actions:
  - name: extract_row
    input: input_grid
    output: grid_row
    description: Get the first (and only observed) row from the input_grid.
  - name: identify_first_element
    input: grid_row
    output: first_element
    description: Get the element at the first index (column 0) of the grid_row.
  - name: slice_row
    input: grid_row
    output: remaining_elements
    description: Create a new 1D array containing all elements of the grid_row except the first one.
  - name: append_element_to_row
    input:
      - remaining_elements
      - first_element
    output: transformed_row
    description: Create a new 1D array by appending the first_element to the end of the remaining_elements.
  - name: construct_output_grid
    input: transformed_row
    output: output_grid
    description: Create the output_grid (likely by placing the transformed_row as the first row of a new grid with the original shape).
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_grid
    to: output_grid
    rule: The output_grid is formed by applying a circular shift (rotation) to the elements within the first row of the input_grid. The first element of the row moves to the last position, and all other elements shift one position to the left.
  - type: positional_shift
    description: Within the row, all elements except the first shift one position to the left in the output grid compared to their position in the input grid.
  - type: element_conservation
    description: All elements present in the input_grid's row are also present in the output_grid's row, with the same frequency.
