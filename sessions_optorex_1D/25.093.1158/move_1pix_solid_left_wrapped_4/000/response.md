*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of integers.
    *   The length of the output sequence is the same as the length of the input sequence in all examples.
    *   The integers within the sequences vary, including 0 and non-zero digits.
    *   The relative order of most elements seems preserved, but there's a shift.

*   **YAML Fact Document:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: Perform a left rotation on a sequence of integers.
    elements:
      - name: input_sequence
        type: list[int]
        description: The initial sequence of integers.
      - name: output_sequence
        type: list[int]
        description: The sequence after transformation.
      - name: first_element
        type: int
        description: The integer at the first position (index 0) of the input sequence.
    actions:
      - name: remove_first
        input: input_sequence
        output: modified_sequence (input_sequence without the first element)
        description: Removes the element at index 0.
      - name: append_element
        input: 
          - sequence: modified_sequence
          - element: first_element
        output: output_sequence
        description: Appends the previously removed first element to the end of the modified sequence.
    relationships:
      - type: transformation
        from: input_sequence
        to: output_sequence
        rule: The output sequence is generated by taking the first element of the input sequence and moving it to the last position, shifting all other elements one position to the left. This is equivalent to a left circular shift or rotation by one position.
      - type: identity
        property: length
        element1: input_sequence
        element2: output_sequence
        description: The length of the input and output sequences are identical.
      - type: composition
        element1: input_sequence
        element2: output_sequence
        description: The set of elements (multiset) in the input and output sequences are identical.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the first element of the input sequence.
    2.  Create a new sequence containing all elements of the input sequence *except* the first element, maintaining their relative order.
    3.  Append the identified first element to the end of this new sequence.
    4.  The resulting sequence is the output.
