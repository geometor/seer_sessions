Okay, let's analyze the provided examples.

## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence (list) of single-digit integers.
The core elements appear to be:
1.  **Zeroes (0):** These act as delimiters or placeholders.
2.  **Non-zero numbers:** These form contiguous blocks or segments within the sequence.
3.  **Contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers:** These are the primary objects being manipulated.
4.  **Position/Index:** The location of numbers and blocks within the sequence is crucial.

The transformation seems to involve identifying a specific location based on the pattern of zeros and non-zeros, and then performing a positional shift or swap involving a non-zero block and an adjacent zero. Specifically, it looks for the *first* instance where a non-zero number is followed immediately by a zero. The block of non-zero numbers ending just before this zero is identified, and then a positional adjustment occurs.

## Facts


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: List[int]
  Description: A sequence of single-digit integers.

Output:
  Type: List[int]
  Description: A transformed sequence of single-digit integers based on the input.

Objects:
  - Name: ZeroElement
    Properties:
      - value: 0
  - Name: NonZeroElement
    Properties:
      - value: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
  - Name: ContiguousNonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - elements: List[NonZeroElement]
      - start_index: int
      - end_index: int
    Description: A sequence of one or more adjacent NonZeroElements.

Relationships:
  - Type: Precedes
    Arg1: Element | Block
    Arg2: Element | Block
    Description: Arg1 appears immediately before Arg2 in the sequence.
  - Type: Follows
    Arg1: Element | Block
    Arg2: Element | Block
    Description: Arg1 appears immediately after Arg2 in the sequence.
  - Type: ContainsIndex
    Arg1: Sequence
    Arg2: Index
    Description: The sequence includes the specified index.

Identified Pattern:
  - Trigger: Finding the first index 'm' such that sequence[m] is ZeroElement AND sequence[m-1] is NonZeroElement.
  - Target Block: The ContiguousNonZeroBlock ending at index 'm-1'. Let its start index be 'k'.
  - Condition: Check if 'k' > 0.
  - Action (if k > 0): The NonZeroBlock (sequence[k:m]) and the element preceding it (sequence[k-1]) shift positions. The block moves one step left, and the preceding element moves to the position immediately after the block (index m-1).
  - Action (if k == 0): The last element of the NonZeroBlock (sequence[m-1]) swaps positions with the ZeroElement immediately following it (sequence[m]).

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Examine the input sequence from left to right, starting at the second element (index 1).
2.  Find the first index `m` where the element at `m` is 0 and the element at the preceding index `m-1` is non-zero.
3.  If no such index `m` is found (e.g., the sequence contains no zeros, or all zeros are at the beginning or only preceded by other zeros), return the input sequence unchanged.
4.  If such an index `m` is found, identify the contiguous block of non-zero numbers that ends at index `m-1`. Find the starting index `k` of this block.
5.  Check if the starting index `k` is 0.
    *   If `k` is **not** 0 (i.e., `k > 0`):
        *   Identify the element at index `k-1` (which will be 0).
        *   Identify the block of non-zero numbers from index `k` to `m-1`.
        *   Construct the output sequence by taking the elements before `k-1`, followed by the non-zero block, followed by the element originally at `k-1`, followed by the elements from index `m` onwards.
    *   If `k` **is** 0:
        *   Swap the element at index `m-1` (the last element of the non-zero block) with the element at index `m` (the zero).
        *   Construct the output sequence accordingly.
6.  Return the modified sequence.
