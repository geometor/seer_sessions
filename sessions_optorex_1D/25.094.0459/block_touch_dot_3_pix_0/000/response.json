Other non-zero numbers (`1`, `5`, `6`, `7` in the examples) seem to be movable elements.\n*   **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation primarily affects the portion of the sequence *before* the first occurrence of the number `2`. Within this left portion, all non-zero elements (excluding the `2` itself) are shifted to the right, congregating just before the `2`. All the `0`s originally in this left portion are moved to the beginning of this portion. The relative order of the non-zero, non-`2` elements within the left portion is preserved. The part of the sequence starting from the first `2` onwards remains unchanged. If `2` is not present or is at the very beginning, or if all non-zero elements are already consolidated to the right of the zeros in the left part, the sequence remains unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
