Task: Reorder elements in a sequence based on a separator.

Objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The input and output data structure.
  - name: element
    type: int
    description: Individual number within the sequence.
    properties:
      - role: Can be 'space' (0), 'separator' (2), or 'movable' (other non-zero numbers).

Region:
  - name: left_part
    description: Sub-sequence from the start up to the first 'separator' (2). If no 'separator', it's the whole sequence.
  - name: right_part
    description: Sub-sequence from the first 'separator' (2) to the end. Empty if no 'separator'.

Action:
  - name: partition
    description: Split the sequence into 'left_part' and 'right_part' based on the first occurrence of the 'separator' (2).
  - name: segregate
    on: left_part
    description: Separate 'space' elements (0) from 'movable' elements within the 'left_part'.
  - name: reorder
    on: left_part
    description: Reconstruct the 'left_part' by placing all 'space' elements first, followed by all 'movable' elements, preserving the relative order of the 'movable' elements.
  - name: concatenate
    description: Join the reordered 'left_part' with the original 'right_part' to form the final output sequence.

Relationships:
  - The 'separator' (2) defines the boundary for the reordering operation.
  - Elements in the 'right_part' are invariant.
  - Within the 'left_part', the relative order of 'movable' elements is preserved during the reordering.
