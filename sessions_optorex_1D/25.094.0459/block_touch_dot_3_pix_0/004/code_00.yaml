Task: Reorder elements in a sequence based on the first occurrence of a specific separator element.

Objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The input and output data structure, representing a 1D array or list.
  - name: element
    type: int
    description: Individual number within the sequence.
    properties:
      - role: Can be 'space' (0), 'separator' (2), or 'movable' (any other non-zero number).

Region:
  - name: left_part
    description: Sub-sequence from the start up to (but not including) the first 'separator' (2). If no 'separator', this part is the entire sequence and the 'right_part' is empty.
  - name: right_part
    description: Sub-sequence from the first 'separator' (2) to the end. Empty if no 'separator'.

Action:
  - name: partition
    description: Split the sequence into 'left_part' and 'right_part' based on the index of the first occurrence of the 'separator' (2).
  - name: segregate
    on: left_part
    description: Identify and collect all 'space' elements (0) and all 'movable' elements (non-zeros) within the 'left_part', preserving the relative order of the 'movable' elements.
  - name: reorder
    on: left_part
    description: Reconstruct the 'left_part' by first placing all the collected 'space' elements, followed by all the collected 'movable' elements (in their preserved relative order).
  - name: concatenate
    description: Join the reordered 'left_part' with the original 'right_part' to form the final output sequence.

Relationships:
  - The 'separator' (2) dictates the boundary for the reordering operation. If absent or at index 0, no reordering occurs on the 'left_part'.
  - Elements in the 'right_part' remain unchanged in position and value.
  - Within the 'left_part', the final arrangement consists of all original zeros grouped at the start, followed by all original non-zeros grouped together, maintaining the non-zeros' initial relative order.
