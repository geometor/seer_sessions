            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial hypothesis correctly identified the role of the number `2` as a separator and that the transformation only affects the portion of the sequence preceding the first `2`. However, the specific reordering logic within that \"left part\" was inaccurate. The previous code attempted to move zeros leftward while keeping non-zeros in place relative to each other, which failed in several cases.\n\nThe results show a different pattern: within the \"left part\" (before the first `2`), all zero elements are collected and placed at the very beginning of this part. All non-zero elements from this \"left part\" are then placed immediately after these collected zeros, maintaining their original relative order. This effectively shifts the block of non-zero elements to the right within the \"left part\", abutting the separator `2`. The \"right part\" (from the first `2` onwards) remains unchanged.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and the corresponding logic to implement this \"collect zeros, append non-zeros\" mechanism for the sub-sequence before the first `2`.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the \"left part\" (elements before the first `2`) for each example:\n\n"
