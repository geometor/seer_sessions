Okay, let's analyze the input-output examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both are sequences (lists) of integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence seems constant across examples (12 elements) and matches the output sequence length.
*   **Key Numbers:** The numbers `0` and `2` appear to have special roles. `0` seems to represent empty space or placeholders. `2` seems to act as a separator or a fixed point. Other non-zero numbers (`1`, `5`, `6`, `7` in the examples) seem to be movable elements.
*   **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation primarily affects the portion of the sequence *before* the first occurrence of the number `2`. Within this left portion, all non-zero elements (excluding the `2` itself) are shifted to the right, congregating just before the `2`. All the `0`s originally in this left portion are moved to the beginning of this portion. The relative order of the non-zero, non-`2` elements within the left portion is preserved. The part of the sequence starting from the first `2` onwards remains unchanged. If `2` is not present or is at the very beginning, or if all non-zero elements are already consolidated to the right of the zeros in the left part, the sequence remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Reorder elements in a sequence based on a separator.

Objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The input and output data structure.
  - name: element
    type: int
    description: Individual number within the sequence.
    properties:
      - role: Can be 'space' (0), 'separator' (2), or 'movable' (other non-zero numbers).

Region:
  - name: left_part
    description: Sub-sequence from the start up to the first 'separator' (2). If no 'separator', it's the whole sequence.
  - name: right_part
    description: Sub-sequence from the first 'separator' (2) to the end. Empty if no 'separator'.

Action:
  - name: partition
    description: Split the sequence into 'left_part' and 'right_part' based on the first occurrence of the 'separator' (2).
  - name: segregate
    on: left_part
    description: Separate 'space' elements (0) from 'movable' elements within the 'left_part'.
  - name: reorder
    on: left_part
    description: Reconstruct the 'left_part' by placing all 'space' elements first, followed by all 'movable' elements, preserving the relative order of the 'movable' elements.
  - name: concatenate
    description: Join the reordered 'left_part' with the original 'right_part' to form the final output sequence.

Relationships:
  - The 'separator' (2) defines the boundary for the reordering operation.
  - Elements in the 'right_part' are invariant.
  - Within the 'left_part', the relative order of 'movable' elements is preserved during the reordering.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the index of the first occurrence of the number `2` in the input sequence.
2.  If `2` is not found, the output is identical to the input. Proceed to step 7.
3.  If `2` is found, divide the input sequence into two parts: the "left part" containing elements before the first `2`, and the "right part" containing elements from the first `2` onwards.
4.  Process the "left part":
    a.  Create a list of all non-zero elements from the "left part", maintaining their original relative order.
    b.  Count the number of zero elements in the "left part".
    c.  Construct the "reordered left part" by creating a list containing the counted number of zeros, followed by the list of non-zero elements from step 4a.
5.  Concatenate the "reordered left part" with the original "right part".
6.  This concatenated sequence is the final output.
7.  Return the resulting sequence.

"""
Identifies the first occurrence of the number 2 in the input sequence.
If 2 is found, it partitions the sequence into a 'left part' (before the first 2) and a 'right part' (from the first 2 onwards).
Within the 'left part', it segregates the zero elements from the non-zero elements.
It then reorders the 'left part' by placing all the zero elements first, followed by the non-zero elements, maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Finally, it concatenates the reordered 'left part' with the original 'right part' to produce the output sequence.
If 2 is not found in the sequence, the original sequence is returned unchanged.
The input and output are space-separated strings of integers.
