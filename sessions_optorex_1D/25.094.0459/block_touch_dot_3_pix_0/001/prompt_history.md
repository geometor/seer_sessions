Okay, let's analyze the input-output examples to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both are sequences (lists) of integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence seems constant across examples (12 elements) and matches the output sequence length.
*   **Key Numbers:** The numbers `0` and `2` appear to have special roles. `0` seems to represent empty space or placeholders. `2` seems to act as a separator or a fixed point. Other non-zero numbers (`1`, `5`, `6`, `7` in the examples) seem to be movable elements.
*   **Transformation Pattern:** The transformation primarily affects the portion of the sequence *before* the first occurrence of the number `2`. Within this left portion, all non-zero elements (excluding the `2` itself) are shifted to the right, congregating just before the `2`. All the `0`s originally in this left portion are moved to the beginning of this portion. The relative order of the non-zero, non-`2` elements within the left portion is preserved. The part of the sequence starting from the first `2` onwards remains unchanged. If `2` is not present or is at the very beginning, or if all non-zero elements are already consolidated to the right of the zeros in the left part, the sequence remains unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Reorder elements in a sequence based on a separator.

Objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The input and output data structure.
  - name: element
    type: int
    description: Individual number within the sequence.
    properties:
      - role: Can be 'space' (0), 'separator' (2), or 'movable' (other non-zero numbers).

Region:
  - name: left_part
    description: Sub-sequence from the start up to the first 'separator' (2). If no 'separator', it's the whole sequence.
  - name: right_part
    description: Sub-sequence from the first 'separator' (2) to the end. Empty if no 'separator'.

Action:
  - name: partition
    description: Split the sequence into 'left_part' and 'right_part' based on the first occurrence of the 'separator' (2).
  - name: segregate
    on: left_part
    description: Separate 'space' elements (0) from 'movable' elements within the 'left_part'.
  - name: reorder
    on: left_part
    description: Reconstruct the 'left_part' by placing all 'space' elements first, followed by all 'movable' elements, preserving the relative order of the 'movable' elements.
  - name: concatenate
    description: Join the reordered 'left_part' with the original 'right_part' to form the final output sequence.

Relationships:
  - The 'separator' (2) defines the boundary for the reordering operation.
  - Elements in the 'right_part' are invariant.
  - Within the 'left_part', the relative order of 'movable' elements is preserved during the reordering.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the index of the first occurrence of the number `2` in the input sequence.
2.  If `2` is not found, the output is identical to the input. Proceed to step 7.
3.  If `2` is found, divide the input sequence into two parts: the "left part" containing elements before the first `2`, and the "right part" containing elements from the first `2` onwards.
4.  Process the "left part":
    a.  Create a list of all non-zero elements from the "left part", maintaining their original relative order.
    b.  Count the number of zero elements in the "left part".
    c.  Construct the "reordered left part" by creating a list containing the counted number of zeros, followed by the list of non-zero elements from step 4a.
5.  Concatenate the "reordered left part" with the original "right part".
6.  This concatenated sequence is the final output.
7.  Return the resulting sequence.
