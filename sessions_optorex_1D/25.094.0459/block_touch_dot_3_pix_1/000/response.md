*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of single-digit integers.
    *   The digit `0` appears to represent empty space or a background value.
    *   The digit `2` appears exactly once in each sequence and seems to act as a fixed pivot or reference point.
    *   Other non-zero digits (e.g., `1`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `8`) often form contiguous blocks.
    *   The transformation involves rearranging the sequence, specifically moving the non-`2`, non-zero blocks relative to the `2`.

*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Locate the index (position) of the digit `2`.
    3.  Find the contiguous block of non-zero digits that are not `2`. Identify its starting and ending indices. If no such block exists, or if it is already adjacent to `2`, the sequence remains unchanged.
    4.  Determine the segment of the sequence between the block and the digit `2`.
    5.  If this segment consists entirely of zeros:
        a.  If the block is to the left of `2`, reconstruct the sequence by placing the zeros first, then the block, then `2`, followed by the rest of the sequence. Effectively, swap the block and the intervening zeros.
        b.  If the block is to the right of `2`, reconstruct the sequence by placing the elements up to `2`, then `2`, then the block, then the zeros, followed by the rest of the sequence. Effectively, swap the block and the intervening zeros.
    6.  Output the rearranged sequence.
