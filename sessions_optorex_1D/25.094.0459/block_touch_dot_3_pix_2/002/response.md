**General Assessment:**

The primary reason for the execution failure was a mismatch between the expected input type (string) and the actual input type (NumPy array) provided by the testing environment. The core transformation logic needed refinement beyond just fixing the type error.

Initial analysis suggested swapping the *entire* adjacent blocks (value block B and zero block Z). However, examples `train_4` and `train_6` showed this was incorrect. In these cases, the value block (B) swapped only with a *segment* of the adjacent zero block (Z), specifically a segment of length 3.

Further analysis revealed a consistent rule:
1.  Find the rightmost occurrence where a block of identical digits `d` (where `d` is not 0 or 2), denoted as block B, is immediately adjacent to a block of zeros, denoted as block Z. This can be B followed by Z (BZ) or Z followed by B (ZB).
2.  Identify the full extent of block B.
3.  Identify the full extent of the *entire* adjacent block Z.
4.  Determine the segment of Z that will participate in the swap. This segment has a length equal to `min(length of Z, 3)`.
5.  If the pattern is BZ, the segment is the *first* `min(len(Z), 3)` zeros of Z.
6.  If the pattern is ZB, the segment is the *last* `min(len(Z), 3)` zeros of Z.
7.  Swap the entire block B with this identified segment of block Z.

This refined rule appears to hold for all provided training examples. The strategy is to update the natural language program and subsequently the code to implement this precise logic, ensuring it handles NumPy arrays/lists as input.

**Metrics and Example Analysis:**

Let's verify the identified blocks and swap segments for each example using the refined rule.
