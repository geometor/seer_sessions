Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers, primarily single digits (0-9).
*   The digit `0` appears frequently and seems to represent empty space or a movable element.
*   Digits other than `0` and `2` (e.g., `1`, `5`, `6`, `9`) appear in contiguous blocks of identical values.
*   The digit `2` seems to be a static element or a boundary marker; it doesn't appear to move or be part of the moving blocks.
*   The core transformation involves rearranging the sequence by moving a block of identical non-zero digits and an adjacent block of zeros.
*   Specifically, it looks like a block of identical digits (not 0 or 2) swaps places with an immediately adjacent block of zeros.
*   This swap occurs at the rightmost possible location in the sequence where such an adjacent pair exists.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Swap the positions of the rightmost adjacent pair consisting of a block of zeros and a block of identical non-zero, non-2 digits.

elements:

    description: Exchange the positions of the identified adjacent Z and B blocks.
    inputs: sequence, Z block info, B block info
    outputs: modified sequence

transformation_goal: To rearrange the sequence by swapping the identified rightmost adjacent Z and B blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Starting from the right end of the input sequence and moving left, search for the first instance where a contiguous block of one or more identical digits `d` (where `d` is not 0 and not 2) is immediately adjacent to a contiguous block of one or more zeros.
2.  This adjacent pair can be in the order `[Block of Zeros][Block of d's]` or `[Block of d's][Block of Zeros]`.
3.  Once the rightmost such adjacent pair is found, swap the entire block of zeros with the entire block of identical digits `d`.
4.  The sequence resulting from this swap is the output. If no such adjacent pair is found, the output is identical to the input.
```python
import re

"""
Transformation Rule:
1. Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2. Scan the list from right to left, looking for the boundary between adjacent elements.
3. Identify the rightmost occurrence where a contiguous block of one or more identical digits `d` (where `d` is not 0 and not 2) is immediately adjacent to a contiguous block of one or more zeros.
4. The adjacent pair can be in the order `[Block of d's][Block of Zeros]` (BZ) or `[Block of Zeros][Block of d's]` (ZB).
5. Once the rightmost such adjacent pair is found, determine the full extent (start and end indices) of both the zero block and the value block.
6. Swap the positions of these two entire blocks within the list.
7. If no such adjacent pair is found, the list remains unchanged.
8. Format the resulting list back into a space-separated string for the output.
