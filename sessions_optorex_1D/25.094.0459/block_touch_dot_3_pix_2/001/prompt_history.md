Okay, I will analyze the provided input-output pairs and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are sequences (lists) of 12 integers, primarily single digits (0-9).
*   The digit `0` appears frequently and seems to represent empty space or a movable element.
*   Digits other than `0` and `2` (e.g., `1`, `5`, `6`, `9`) appear in contiguous blocks of identical values.
*   The digit `2` seems to be a static element or a boundary marker; it doesn't appear to move or be part of the moving blocks.
*   The core transformation involves rearranging the sequence by moving a block of identical non-zero digits and an adjacent block of zeros.
*   Specifically, it looks like a block of identical digits (not 0 or 2) swaps places with an immediately adjacent block of zeros.
*   This swap occurs at the rightmost possible location in the sequence where such an adjacent pair exists.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_description: Swap the positions of the rightmost adjacent pair consisting of a block of zeros and a block of identical non-zero, non-2 digits.

elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - content: digits ranging from 0 to 9

  - object: zero_block
    alias: Z
    properties:
      - type: contiguous subsequence
      - content: one or more '0' digits

  - object: value_block
    alias: B
    properties:
      - type: contiguous subsequence
      - content: one or more identical digits 'd'
      - constraint: 'd' is not 0 and 'd' is not 2

  - object: static_marker
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - behavior: does not participate in the swap, remains in its original position.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: A zero_block (Z) and a value_block (B) are located next to each other in the sequence.
    variants:
      - order: Z immediately precedes B (Z -> B)
      - order: B immediately precedes Z (B -> Z)

action:
  - name: find_swap_pair
    description: Identify the rightmost occurrence in the sequence of an adjacent zero_block (Z) and value_block (B).
    inputs: sequence
    outputs:
      - location and content of Z block
      - location and content of B block
      - relative order (ZB or BZ)

  - name: perform_swap
    description: Exchange the positions of the identified adjacent Z and B blocks.
    inputs: sequence, Z block info, B block info
    outputs: modified sequence

transformation_goal: To rearrange the sequence by swapping the identified rightmost adjacent Z and B blocks.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Starting from the right end of the input sequence and moving left, search for the first instance where a contiguous block of one or more identical digits `d` (where `d` is not 0 and not 2) is immediately adjacent to a contiguous block of one or more zeros.
2.  This adjacent pair can be in the order `[Block of Zeros][Block of d's]` or `[Block of d's][Block of Zeros]`.
3.  Once the rightmost such adjacent pair is found, swap the entire block of zeros with the entire block of identical digits `d`.
4.  The sequence resulting from this swap is the output. If no such adjacent pair is found, the output is identical to the input.
