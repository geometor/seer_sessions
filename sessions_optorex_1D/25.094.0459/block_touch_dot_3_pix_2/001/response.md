Transformation Rule:
1. Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2. Scan the list from right to left, looking for the boundary between adjacent elements.
3. Identify the rightmost occurrence where a contiguous block of one or more identical digits `d` (where `d` is not 0 and not 2) is immediately adjacent to a contiguous block of one or more zeros.
4. The adjacent pair can be in the order `[Block of d's][Block of Zeros]` (BZ) or `[Block of Zeros][Block of d's]` (ZB).
5. Once the rightmost such adjacent pair is found, determine the full extent (start and end indices) of both the zero block and the value block.
6. Swap the positions of these two entire blocks within the list.
7. If no such adjacent pair is found, the list remains unchanged.
8. Format the resulting list back into a space-separated string for the output.
