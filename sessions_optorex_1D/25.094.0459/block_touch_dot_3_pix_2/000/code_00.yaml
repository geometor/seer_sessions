task_description: Swap the positions of the rightmost adjacent pair consisting of a block of zeros and a block of identical non-zero, non-2 digits.

elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - content: digits ranging from 0 to 9

  - object: zero_block
    alias: Z
    properties:
      - type: contiguous subsequence
      - content: one or more '0' digits

  - object: value_block
    alias: B
    properties:
      - type: contiguous subsequence
      - content: one or more identical digits 'd'
      - constraint: 'd' is not 0 and 'd' is not 2

  - object: static_marker
    properties:
      - value: 2
      - behavior: does not participate in the swap, remains in its original position.

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: A zero_block (Z) and a value_block (B) are located next to each other in the sequence.
    variants:
      - order: Z immediately precedes B (Z -> B)
      - order: B immediately precedes Z (B -> Z)

action:
  - name: find_swap_pair
    description: Identify the rightmost occurrence in the sequence of an adjacent zero_block (Z) and value_block (B).
    inputs: sequence
    outputs:
      - location and content of Z block
      - location and content of B block
      - relative order (ZB or BZ)

  - name: perform_swap
    description: Exchange the positions of the identified adjacent Z and B blocks.
    inputs: sequence, Z block info, B block info
    outputs: modified sequence

transformation_goal: To rearrange the sequence by swapping the identified rightmost adjacent Z and B blocks.
