# Objects involved in the transformation
Objects:
  - Sequence: A list of single-digit integers derived from a space-separated input string.
  - Pivot: The digit '2'. Its first occurrence dictates the partitioning.
  - Zeros: The digit '0'. Their positions are modified based on their location relative to the pivot.
  - NonZeroNonTwo: Any digit other than '0' or '2'. Their relative order is generally preserved within their partition.
  - NonZeroThrees: The digit '3', specifically when appearing in the partition before the pivot '2', triggering a special rule.

# Properties of Objects
Properties:
  - Sequence: Contains elements (digits), has a length, can be partitioned.
  - Pivot ('2'): Has an index (position) of its first occurrence. If absent, the sequence is unchanged.
  - Digits: Have a value (0-9) and a position (index) within the sequence.
  - Partitions:
      - BeforePivot: The sub-sequence of digits before the first '2'.
      - AfterPivot: The sub-sequence of digits after the first '2'.

# Actions performed on Objects
Actions:
  - Parse: Convert the input string into a list of integers.
  - FindPivot: Locate the index of the first '2'. Handle the case where '2' is absent.
  - Partition: Split the sequence into BeforePivot, Pivot ('2'), and AfterPivot based on the pivot index.
  - ProcessAfterPivot:
      - Separate Zeros and NonZeroNonTwo digits within this partition.
      - Reconstruct the partition by placing NonZeroNonTwo digits first (preserving relative order), followed by all Zeros.
  - ProcessBeforePivot:
      - Separate Zeros and NonZero digits within this partition.
      - CheckSpecialCase: Determine if NonZero digits exist, Zeros exist, and *all* NonZero digits are '3's.
      - If SpecialCase:
          - Reconstruct the partition by placing all but the last Zero first, followed by all the '3's, followed by the last Zero.
      - Else (GeneralCase):
          - Reconstruct the partition by placing all Zeros first, followed by all NonZero digits (preserving relative order).
  - Combine: Concatenate the processed BeforePivot partition, the Pivot ('2'), and the processed AfterPivot partition.
  - Format: Convert the resulting list of integers back into a space-separated output string.
