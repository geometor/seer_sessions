            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary reason for the failure across all examples is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The previous code was designed to process space-separated strings (`input_str`) but was actually provided with NumPy arrays. This caused the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` when the `parse_input` function (or equivalent logic) attempted string manipulation on the array object.\n\nThe strategy for resolution involves:\n1.  Correcting the input handling to work directly with NumPy arrays or converting them to lists immediately.\n2.  Re-evaluating the transformation logic against all examples, paying close attention to `train_2` which seemed to exhibit special behavior in the initial analysis, potentially missed by the string-based approach.\n3.  Updating the natural language program and YAML facts to accurately reflect the array input and refined logic.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nThe error message is consistent across all examples, indicating the fundamental issue is the input type mismatch. Let's re-examine the transformation based on the array structure:\n\n*   **Input Type:** 1D NumPy array of integers.\n*   **Output Type:** 1D NumPy array of integers (implied by the target format).\n*   **Pivot:** The integer `2` acts as a pivot. The array is conceptually split based on the *first* occurrence of `2`.\n*   **Post-Pivot (`after_2` section):** All zeros (`0`) in this section are moved to the end of the section, preserving the relative order of other non-zero digits.\n    *   *train_1*: After `2` is empty `[]` -> `[]`.\n    *   *train_2*: After `2` is empty `[]` -> `[]`.\n    *   *train_3*: After `2` is `[4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0]` -> `[4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_4*: After `2` is `[0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5]` -> `[5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_5*: After `2` is `[0]` -> `[0]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_6*: After `2` is `[0 8 8 0 0]` -> `[8 8 0 0 0]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_7*: After `2` is `[5 5 5]` -> `[5 5 5]`. (Matches target).\n*   **Pre-Pivot (`before_2` section):**\n    *   *General Rule:* Zeros (`0`) are moved to the beginning of this section, preserving the relative order of other non-zero digits.\n    *   *train_1*: Before `2` is `[0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_3*: Before `2` is `[0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_4*: Before `2` is `[0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_5*: Before `2` is `[0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_6*: Before `2` is `[0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *train_7*: Before `2` is `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. (Matches target).\n    *   *Special Case (`train_2`)*: Before `2` is `[3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0]`. The target output's `before_2` section is `[0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0]`. This confirms the special case: if the `before_2` section contains *only* `3`s and `0`s (and at least one of each), all zeros *except one* are moved to the start, the `3`s follow, and the last zero is placed at the end of this section.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
