It acts as a stable pivot or separator in the sequence. Its position doesn't change relative to the rearrangement happening around it.\n*   **Mobile Element (`0`):** The digit `0` is the element being moved. Its final position depends on whether it initially appeared before or after the first `2`.\n*   **Other Elements (Non-zero, Non-two):** Digits other than `0` and `2` seem to maintain their relative order within their respective sections (before or after the `2`) but shift their absolute positions to accommodate the moved `0`s.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves partitioning the sequence based on the first `2` and then rearranging the `0`s within those partitions. Zeros originally before the `2` congregate at the beginning of the pre-`2` section. Zeros originally after the `2` congregate at the end of the post-`2` section.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
