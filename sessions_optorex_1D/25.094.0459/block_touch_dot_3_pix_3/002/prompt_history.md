Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single-digit integers, presented as space-separated strings.
*   **Key Element (`2`):** The digit `2` appears to play a crucial role. It acts as a stable pivot or separator in the sequence. Its position doesn't change relative to the rearrangement happening around it.
*   **Mobile Element (`0`):** The digit `0` is the element being moved. Its final position depends on whether it initially appeared before or after the first `2`.
*   **Other Elements (Non-zero, Non-two):** Digits other than `0` and `2` seem to maintain their relative order within their respective sections (before or after the `2`) but shift their absolute positions to accommodate the moved `0`s.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation involves partitioning the sequence based on the first `2` and then rearranging the `0`s within those partitions. Zeros originally before the `2` congregate at the beginning of the pre-`2` section. Zeros originally after the `2` congregate at the end of the post-`2` section.

**YAML Facts:**


```python
"""
The transformation rule operates on a sequence of single-digit integers. 
It identifies the first occurrence of the digit '2' as a pivot point.
The sequence is split into two parts: the portion before the first '2' and the portion after it.

For the part *before* the '2':
All '0's are collected and moved to the beginning of this part.
The remaining non-zero digits maintain their original relative order after the moved '0's.

For the part *after* the '2':
All '0's are collected and moved to the end of this part.
The remaining non-zero digits maintain their original relative order before the moved '0's.

The final output sequence is constructed by concatenating:
1. The processed part before the '2'.
2. The pivot digit '2'.
3. The processed part after the '2'.

If '2' is not present, the sequence remains unchanged (although all examples contain '2').
The input and output are space-separated strings of digits.
