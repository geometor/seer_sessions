            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe primary error reported (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicates a mismatch between the expected input type (a string) and the actual type received by the `transform` function during testing (a NumPy array). This likely stems from the testing environment setup rather than the core logic defined in the natural language program. Assuming the function *should* receive a string as described in the examples, the immediate fix involves ensuring the input is correctly handled as a string.\n\nHowever, a thorough re-examination of the examples against the initial natural language program reveals that the program, while mostly correct, fails to accurately predict the output for `train_2`. This necessitates a refinement of the transformation rule itself, specifically concerning the handling of zeros appearing *before* the pivot digit '2'.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the input type mismatch error but proceed assuming the intended input is a string.\n2.  Analyze the discrepancy in `train_2` to identify the specific condition causing the deviation from the general rule.\n3.  Formulate a revised hypothesis that accounts for all examples.\n4.  Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect this refined understanding.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's re-analyze each example, focusing on the partition around the first '2' and the movement of '0's, specifically testing the hypothesis derived from Example 2: *If the non-zero digits before the '2' consist only of '3's and there are zeros present before the '2', exactly one zero remains immediately before the '2'; otherwise, all zeros before the '2' move to the far left.*\n\n| Example | Input                       | Output                      | Pivot '2' Index | Before '2'                | Non-Zeros Before | Zeros Before | Only '3's Before? | Special Case? | Output Before '2'             | After '2'           | Zeros After | Non-Zeros After | Output After '2'    | Matches Hypothesis? |\n| :------ | :-------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------- | :----------- | :---------------- | :------------ | :---------------------------- | :------------------ | :---------- | :-------------- | :------------------ | :------------------ |\n| train_1 | `0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2` | `0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 2` | 11              | `0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0` | `9 9 9 9 9 9`    | 5            | No                | No            | `0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9`     | ``                  | 0           | ``              | ``                  | Yes                 |\n| train_2 | `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 2` | `0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 2` | 11              | `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0` | `3 3 3 3 3 3 3`    | 4            | Yes               | Yes           | `0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0`     | ``                  "
