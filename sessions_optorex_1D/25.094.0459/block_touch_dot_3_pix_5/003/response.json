Accept the input sequence (a list or array of 12 integers).\n2.  Identify a 'pivot' element (always the digit '2'). Record its index.\n3.  Identify a contiguous block of identical digits (the 'payload') that are not '0' or '2'. Record its value, length, and starting index.\n4.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initialized with '0's.\n5.  Place the 'pivot' element ('2') in the new sequence at the same index it occupied in the input sequence.\n6.  Determine the target start index for placing the payload block in the output sequence:\n    - If the payload was originally to the left of the pivot (payload_start_index < pivot_index), the target start index is pivot_index - payload_length.\n    - If the payload was originally to the right of the pivot (payload_start_index > pivot_index), the target start index is pivot_index + 1.\n7.  Place the 'payload' block (repeating payload_value for payload_length times) into the output sequence starting at the calculated target start index.\n8.
