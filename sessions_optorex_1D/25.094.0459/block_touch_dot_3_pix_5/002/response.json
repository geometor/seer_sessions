            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary issue identified is an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function was designed expecting a string input, which it would then split into numbers. However, the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array directly. The core logic identified in the initial analysis (finding the pivot '2', identifying the payload block, and moving the payload adjacent to the pivot while preserving relative order) seems correct based on the input/output pairs.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is straightforward: modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array as input, eliminating the string parsing step (`.split()`). The rest of the logic for identifying elements and rearranging the array should remain largely the same.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe execution failed consistently across all examples at the input processing stage due to the type mismatch. Therefore, metrics related to the correctness of the transformation logic itself (e.g., number of correctly placed elements, identification accuracy) cannot be gathered from the failed runs.\n\n*   **Input Type:** Assumed `string`, Actual `numpy.ndarray`.\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError`.\n*   **Error Location:** Input parsing (`input_string.split()`).\n*   **Consistency:** The error occurred identically for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the trace.\n*   **Logical Validation:** A manual walkthrough of the examples confirms the intended logic (find pivot '2', find payload block, move payload adjacent to pivot) correctly maps inputs to outputs.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
