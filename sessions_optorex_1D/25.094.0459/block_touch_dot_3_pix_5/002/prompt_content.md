"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 integers based on the following rules:
1.  Identify a 'pivot' element (always the digit '2').
2.  Identify a contiguous block of identical digits (the 'payload') that are not '0' or '2'.
3.  Create a new sequence of length 12, initialized with '0's.
4.  Place the 'pivot' element ('2') in the new sequence at the same index it occupied in the input sequence.
5.  Place the 'payload' block in the new sequence immediately adjacent to the 'pivot'.
    - If the payload was originally to the left of the pivot, place it immediately to the left in the output.
    - If the payload was originally to the right of the pivot, place it immediately to the right in the output.
6.  All other positions in the output sequence remain '0'.
