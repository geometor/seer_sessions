Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the elements:**

*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
*   **Key Values:**
    *   `0`: Appears to represent a background or empty space.
    *   `2`: Acts as a fixed pivot or anchor point. There is always exactly one '2' in the input.
    *   Other non-zero digits (e.g., 4, 5, 7, 8, 9): These form contiguous blocks (the 'payload'). There is always exactly one such block in the input.
*   **Transformation Goal:** The primary action seems to be repositioning the 'payload' block so that it becomes immediately adjacent to the '2', while maintaining the original index of the '2'.

**Observations:**

1.  The length of the sequence remains constant (12).
2.  The number '2' always stays in the same position (index) from input to output.
3.  A contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (other than '2') exists in the input.
4.  In the output, this block is moved to be directly next to the '2'.
5.  If the block was originally to the left of the '2', it ends up immediately to the left of the '2' in the output.
6.  If the block was originally to the right of the '2', it ends up immediately to the right of the '2' in the output.
7.  All positions not occupied by the '2' or the moved block are filled with '0's.
8.  If the block is already adjacent to the '2' in the input (like in `train_6`), the input and output are identical.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Reposition a block of digits adjacent to a pivot element in a sequence.

Elements:
  - Type: Sequence
    Properties:
      - ContainsIntegers: true
      - Length: 12
  - Type: PivotElement
    Properties:
      - Value: 2
      - Count: 1 per sequence
      - Role: Anchor point, position is invariant between input and output.
  - Type: PayloadBlock
    Properties:
      - ContainsIntegers: true
      - Digits: Identical, non-zero, not equal to 2.
      - Contiguous: Forms a single block.
      - Count: 1 per sequence
      - Role: The object to be moved.
  - Type: BackgroundElement
    Properties:
      - Value: 0
      - Role: Fills space not occupied by Pivot or Payload in the output.

Relationships:
  - InOutput: PayloadBlock is directly adjacent to PivotElement.
  - Invariance: The index of PivotElement is the same in Input and Output.
  - RelativeOrder: The order (PayloadBlock then PivotElement OR PivotElement then PayloadBlock) is preserved from Input to Output adjacency.

Action:
  - Identify: Locate PivotElement and PayloadBlock (value, length, position) in the Input Sequence.
  - Construct: Create an Output Sequence of the same length, initialized with BackgroundElement.
  - PlacePivot: Copy PivotElement to Output Sequence at its original index.
  - PlacePayload: Copy PayloadBlock to Output Sequence immediately adjacent to the PivotElement, preserving their original relative order.
  - FillBackground: Ensure all remaining positions in Output Sequence are BackgroundElement.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new output sequence of length 12, initially filled with zeros.
2.  Find the index (`pivot_index`) of the element '2' in the input sequence.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of identical digits in the input sequence that are neither '0' nor '2'. Record the digit value (`payload_value`), the length of the block (`payload_length`), and the starting index (`payload_start_index`).
4.  Place the digit '2' into the output sequence at `pivot_index`.
5.  Determine the placement of the payload block in the output:
    *   If the payload block's `payload_start_index` in the input is less than `pivot_index` (block was originally to the left of '2'), fill the `payload_length` positions in the output sequence immediately to the left of `pivot_index` (i.e., from index `pivot_index - payload_length` up to `pivot_index - 1`) with the `payload_value`.
    *   If the payload block's `payload_start_index` in the input is greater than `pivot_index` (block was originally to the right of '2'), fill the `payload_length` positions in the output sequence immediately to the right of `pivot_index` (i.e., from index `pivot_index + 1` up to `pivot_index + payload_length`) with the `payload_value`.
6.  Return the completed output sequence.
```python
import re

"""
Transforms a sequence of 12 integers based on the following rules:
1.  Identify a 'pivot' element (always the digit '2').
2.  Identify a contiguous block of identical digits (the 'payload') that are not '0' or '2'.
3.  Create a new sequence of length 12, initialized with '0's.
4.  Place the 'pivot' element ('2') in the new sequence at the same index it occupied in the input sequence.
5.  Place the 'payload' block in the new sequence immediately adjacent to the 'pivot'.
    - If the payload was originally to the left of the pivot, place it immediately to the left in the output.
    - If the payload was originally to the right of the pivot, place it immediately to the right in the output.
6.  All other positions in the output sequence remain '0'.
