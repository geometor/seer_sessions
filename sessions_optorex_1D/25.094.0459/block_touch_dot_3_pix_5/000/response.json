            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are 1-dimensional sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.\n*   **Key Values:**\n    *   `0`: Appears to represent a background or empty space.\n    *   `2`: Acts as a fixed pivot or anchor point. There is always exactly one '2' in the input.\n    *   Other non-zero digits (e.g., 4, 5, 7, 8, 9): These form contiguous blocks (the 'payload'). There is always exactly one such block in the input.\n*   **Transformation Goal:** The primary action seems to be repositioning the 'payload' block so that it becomes immediately adjacent to the '2', while maintaining the original index of the '2'.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1.  The length of the sequence remains constant (12).\n2.  The number '2' always stays in the same position (index) from input to output.\n3.  A contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (other than '2') exists in the input.\n4.  In the output, this block is moved to be directly next to the '2'.\n5.  If the block was originally to the left of the '2', it ends up immediately to the left of the '2' in the output.\n6.  If the block was originally to the right of the '2', it ends up immediately to the right of the '2' in the output.\n7.  All positions not occupied by the '2' or the moved block are filled with '0's.\n8.  If the block is already adjacent to the '2' in the input (like in `train_6`), the input and output are identical.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
