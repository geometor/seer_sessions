Task: Reposition a block of digits adjacent to a pivot element in a sequence.

Elements:
  - Type: Sequence
    Properties:
      - ContainsIntegers: true
      - Length: 12
  - Type: PivotElement
    Properties:
      - Value: 2
      - Count: 1 per sequence
      - Role: Anchor point, position is invariant between input and output.
  - Type: PayloadBlock
    Properties:
      - ContainsIntegers: true
      - Digits: Identical, non-zero, not equal to 2.
      - Contiguous: Forms a single block.
      - Count: 1 per sequence
      - Role: The object to be moved.
  - Type: BackgroundElement
    Properties:
      - Value: 0
      - Role: Fills space not occupied by Pivot or Payload in the output.

Relationships:
  - InOutput: PayloadBlock is directly adjacent to PivotElement.
  - Invariance: The index of PivotElement is the same in Input and Output.
  - RelativeOrder: The order (PayloadBlock then PivotElement OR PivotElement then PayloadBlock) is preserved from Input to Output adjacency.

Action:
  - Identify: Locate PivotElement and PayloadBlock (value, length, position) in the Input Sequence.
  - Construct: Create an Output Sequence of the same length, initialized with BackgroundElement.
  - PlacePivot: Copy PivotElement to Output Sequence at its original index.
  - PlacePayload: Copy PayloadBlock to Output Sequence immediately adjacent to the PivotElement, preserving their original relative order.
  - FillBackground: Ensure all remaining positions in Output Sequence are BackgroundElement.
