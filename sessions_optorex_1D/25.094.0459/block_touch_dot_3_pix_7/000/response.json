The object block moves towards the '2' by swapping with the adjacent empty block that lies between it and the '2'.\n    *   If the object block is already adjacent to the '2', or if there isn't an adjacent empty block between the object block and the '2', no swap occurs, and the input remains unchanged.\n    *   Cases with no single object block (e.g., multiple blocks, or only '0's and '2's) also result in no change.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
