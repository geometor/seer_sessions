This error typically occurs in Python when a multi-element array (like a NumPy array or sometimes a list comparison that results in multiple booleans) is used in a context expecting a single boolean (e.g., `if array:`).\n    *   Reviewing the code, the error likely stemmed from the block content swapping logic:\n        "

If `len1 != len2`, this logic incorrectly modifies the list length or structure, potentially leading to downstream errors or incorrect results even if it didn't raise the specific \"ambiguous truth value\" error directly (perhaps the test environment converted lists to NumPy arrays implicitly somewhere, triggering the error upon faulty comparison/evaluation).\n    *   The core logic identified (find blocks, locate '2', find single object block, check adjacent empty block towards '2', swap) seems generally correct based on examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.\n    *   However, applying this \"swap adjacent blocks\" rule strictly leads to outputs for examples 4 and 7 that differ from the provided target outputs.\n        *   `train_4`: Rule predicts `[0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, target is `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]`.\n        *   `train_7`: Rule predicts `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 2]`, target is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 2]`.\n    *   **Strategy:** Assume the \"swap adjacent blocks\" rule derived from examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 is the intended core logic.
