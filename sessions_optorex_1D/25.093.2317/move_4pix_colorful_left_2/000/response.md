*   **Perception:**
    *   The input is a sequence of 12 digits separated by spaces.
    *   The output is also a sequence of 12 digits separated by spaces.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs reveals a consistent pattern: the sequence appears to be shifted cyclically to the left.
    *   Specifically, the first four digits of the input sequence are moved to the end of the sequence in the output, while the remaining digits shift to the left to fill the beginning positions. This is equivalent to a cyclic left shift by 4 positions.

*   **Facts:**

    relationships:
      - The output sequence is the result of applying a cyclic left shift of 4 positions to the input sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Perform a cyclic left shift on the sequence by 4 positions.
    3.  The resulting sequence is the output.
