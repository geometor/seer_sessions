"""
Transforms an input NumPy array of integers by identifying the contiguous 
segment containing all non-zero elements (from the first non-zero to the last 
non-zero) and shifting this segment 4 positions to the left within an array 
of the same shape, padding the remaining positions with zeros. If no non-zero 
elements exist, the output is all zeros. If the shift moves the start of the 
segment to a negative index, the segment is placed starting at index 0, 
effectively truncating the part that would have been shifted off the left edge
(though the examples provided imply the full segment fits when target_start_idx >= 0).
Based on the error logs from previous runs and re-analysis, the implementation 
below should correctly reflect the logic derived from the examples.
