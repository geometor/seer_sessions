Zeros act primarily as padding.\n*   **Transformation:** The block of numbers containing all the non-zero elements is moved within the sequence. The relative order of the non-zero numbers (and any zeros between the first and last non-zero number) is preserved.\n*   **Movement Pattern:** The segment containing the non-zero numbers appears to be shifted to the left. Comparing the starting position of the segment in the input and output reveals a consistent shift.\n\n**Analysis of the Shift:**\n\nLet's define the \"active segment\" as the sub-sequence starting from the first non-zero number and ending with the last non-zero number in the input.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `... 4 9 3 7` (starts index 8). Output `... 4 9 3 7 ...` (starts index 4). Shift = 4 left.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `... 1 7 7 4 4 0` (segment `1 7 7 4 4`, starts index 6). Output `0 0 1 7 7 4 4 ...` (segment `1 7 7 4 4`, starts index 2). Shift = 4 left.\n*   **Example 7:** Input `... 1 1 5 4 8 1 2 0` (segment `1 1 5 4 8 1 2`, starts index 4). Output `1 1 5 4 8 1 2 ...` (segment `1 1 5 4 8 1 2`, starts index 0). Shift = 4 left.\n\nThe observation holds true for all examples: the segment identified by the first to the last non-zero element is shifted exactly 4 positions to the left.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
