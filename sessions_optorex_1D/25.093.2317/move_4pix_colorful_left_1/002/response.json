            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe primary error across all examples (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the input data type in the previous analysis. The input is not a space-separated string but rather a list-like structure, likely a NumPy array or a standard Python list, containing integers.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (locating the first and last non-zero elements, extracting the segment between them, calculating a new starting position by shifting left by 4 positions (or until the start), and reconstructing the sequence with appropriate padding) appears consistent with the input/output pairs when the input is treated as a list/array of integers.\n\nThe strategy is to revise the understanding of the input format and adjust the natural language program and subsequent code implementation to operate directly on a list/array of integers, removing the string parsing step.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe following metrics were re-evaluated assuming the input is a list of integers:\n\n| Example | Input List                                | Length | First NZ Idx | Last NZ Idx | Core Segment          | Input Leading Zeros | Calculated Output Leading Zeros (max(0, Input Leading Zeros - 4)) | Expected Output                           | Matches? |\n| :------ | :---------------------------------------- | :----- | :----------- | :---------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,3,5,0]`               | 12     | 8            | 10          | `[8,3,5]`             | 8                   | 4                                                                 | `[0,0,0,0,8,3,5,0,0,0,0,0]`               | Yes      |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,0,9,2,7,2,3,3,4,0]`               | 12     | 4            | 10          | `[9,2,7,2,3,3,4]`     | 4                   | 0                                                                 | `[9,2,7,2,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0]`               | Yes      |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,9,1,6,7,3,4]`               | 12     | 5            | 11          | `[7,9,1,6,7,3,4]`     | 5                   | 1                                                                 | `[0,7,9,1,6,7,3,4,0,0,0,0]`               | Yes      |\n| train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0]`               | 12     | 4            | 5           | `[7,6]`               | 4                   | 0                                                                 | `[7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`               | Yes      |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,5,8,1,2]`               | 12     | 6            | 11          | `[8,8,5,8,1,2]`       | 6                   | 2                                                                 | `[0,0,8,8,5,8,1,2,0,0,0,0]`               | Yes      |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0]`               | 12     | 6            | 7           | `[3,3]`               | 6                   | 2                                                                 | `[0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`               | Yes      |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,0,0,0,9,2,0,0,0,0,0]`               | 12     | 5            | 6           | `[9,2]`               | 5                   | 1                                                                 | `[0,9,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`               | Yes      |\n\nThe analysis confirms the core logic holds for all training examples when the input is treated as a list/array of integers.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
