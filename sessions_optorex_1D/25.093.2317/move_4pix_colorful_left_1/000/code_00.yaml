task_description: Rearrange a sequence of digits by shifting the core non-zero segment to the left.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers (derived from space-separated string)
      - length: constant between input and output
      - items: single digits (0-9)
  - object: core_segment
    description: The subsequence starting from the first non-zero digit and ending at the last non-zero digit, inclusive.
    properties:
      - content: digits (non-zero and potentially included zeros)
      - location_input: defined by the index of the first non-zero digit (number of leading zeros)
      - location_output: derived from the input location
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    action: identify_core_segment
    inputs: [input_sequence]
    outputs: [core_segment, first_nonzero_index, last_nonzero_index]
  - type: transformation
    action: calculate_output_position
    inputs: [first_nonzero_index]
    outputs: [output_leading_zeros]
    rule: output_leading_zeros = max(0, first_nonzero_index - 4)
  - type: transformation
    action: reconstruct_output
    inputs: [output_leading_zeros, core_segment, input_sequence_length]
    outputs: [output_sequence]
    rule: Concatenate 'output_leading_zeros' count of zeros, the 'core_segment', and trailing zeros to match 'input_sequence_length'.
special_cases:
  - condition: Input sequence contains only zeros.
    result: Output sequence is identical to the input sequence. (The core segment is empty, leading zeros calculation still applies but doesn't change the sequence visually).
