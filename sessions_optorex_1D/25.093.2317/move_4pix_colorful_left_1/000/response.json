They can be interpreted as lists or arrays of integers.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains constant between the input and the output in all examples.\n3.  **Core Content:** The non-zero digits and the zeros situated between the first and last non-zero digits seem to form a \"core segment\" or \"payload\". This core segment appears unchanged in the output.\n4.  **Positional Shift:** The primary transformation is a positional shift of this core segment within the sequence. The core segment consistently moves towards the beginning of the sequence (left shift).\n5.  **Shift Magnitude:** The amount of the left shift appears deterministic. By comparing the number of leading zeros in the input versus the output, we can deduce the rule.\n    *   train_1: 8 leading zeros in -> 4 leading zeros out (Shift of 4 positions left)\n    *   train_2: 4 leading zeros in -> 0 leading zeros out (Shift of 4 positions left)\n    *   train_3: 5 leading zeros in -> 1 leading zero out (Shift of 4 positions left)\n    *   train_4: 4 leading zeros in -> 0 leading zeros out (Shift of 4 positions left)\n    *   train_5: 6 leading zeros in -> 2 leading zeros out (Shift of 4 positions left)\n    *   train_6: 6 leading zeros in -> 2 leading zeros out (Shift of 4 positions left)\n    *   train_7: 5 leading zeros in -> 1 leading zero out (Shift of 4 positions left)\n    The number of leading zeros in the output is consistently 4 less than the number of leading zeros in the input, with a minimum of 0 leading zeros.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
