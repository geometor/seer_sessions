            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: find the contiguous block between the first and last non-zero digits in the input sequence and shift this block 4 positions to the left in the output sequence, padding the remaining positions with zeros. The provided training examples consistently support this rule. The reported error, \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\", is typically associated with using a NumPy array in a boolean context where a single True/False value is expected (e.g., `if my_numpy_array:`). Since the provided Python code primarily uses standard Python lists and integer comparisons (`!= 0`), this error suggests either:\n    1.  The execution environment or testing harness implicitly converts lists to NumPy arrays at some point before a boolean check.\n    2.  An earlier version of the code (perhaps the first one shown with `import numpy as np`) was used, and NumPy operations were involved, leading to the error.\n    3.  There's a misunderstanding of where exactly the error occurred within the execution flow.\n\n    Assuming the transformation logic derived from the examples is correct, the strategy is to ensure the implementation relies purely on standard Python list operations that are not ambiguous in boolean contexts and re-verify the logic against the examples. The natural language program itself appears sound based on the examples.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    Let's re-analyze the examples to confirm the pattern and parameters. We'll denote the input sequence as `I`, the output sequence as `O`, the length as `N`, the index of the first non-zero element as `first_nz`, the index of the last non-zero element as `last_nz`, the extracted block as `B`, the length of the block as `len(B)`, and the calculated output start index as `out_start`.\n\n    | Example | N  | `first_nz` | `last_nz` | Block `B`         | `len(B)` | `out_start` (`first_nz` - 4) | Matches Output |\n    | :------ | :- | :--------- | :-------- | :---------------- | :------- | :--------------------------- | :------------- |\n    | train_1 | 12 | 4          | 7         | `[9, 3, 2, 5]`    | 4        | 0                            | Yes            |\n    | train_2 | 12 | 5          | 10        | `[6, 8, 3, 4, 9, 8]` | 6        | 1                            | Yes            |\n    | train_3 | 12 | 6          | 9         | `[4, 6, 3, 4]`    | 4        | 2                            | Yes            |\n    | train_4 | 12 | 6          | 8         | `[8, 1, 7]`       | 3        | 2                            | Yes            |\n    | train_5 | 12 | 5          | 11        | `[3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 7, 1]` | 7        | 1                            | Yes            |\n    | train_6 | 12 | 10         | 11        | `[8, 1]`          | 2        | 6                            | Yes            |\n    | train_7 | 12 | 5          | 7         | `[2, 8, 7]`       | 3        | 1                            | Yes            |\n\n    The analysis confirms the rule: the block from `first_nz` to `last_nz` (inclusive) is shifted left by 4 positions (`out_start = first_nz - 4`). The rule holds for all provided training examples. The implementation error needs correction, but the underlying logic seems robust for these cases.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
