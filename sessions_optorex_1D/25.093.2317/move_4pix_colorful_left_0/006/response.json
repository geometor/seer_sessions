            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples. The metrics gathered confirm that the task involves:\n1.  Identifying the contiguous block of digits between the first and last non-zero elements in the input sequence.\n2.  Shifting this identified block exactly 4 positions to the left.\n3.  Constructing the output sequence by placing the shifted block into an array of zeros of the same length as the input.\n\nThe error message (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") encountered during testing likely stems from the execution environment or a potential type mismatch (e.g., the function receiving a NumPy array instead of a standard list, causing issues with comparisons like `x != 0` if `x` itself was an array element), rather than a flaw in the fundamental transformation logic derived from the examples. The strategy is to refine the description of the logic based on the consistent patterns observed and ensure the implementation details (to be handled by the coder) are robust against potential type issues if the execution environment uses NumPy arrays.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nThe following metrics were gathered using `tool_code` execution to analyze the relationship between input and output for each training example:\n\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for all examples.\n*   **Block Identification:** The block is correctly identified as the sub-sequence from the index of the first non-zero digit (`input_first_nz_idx`) to the index of the last non-zero digit (`input_last_nz_idx`), inclusive.\n*   **Shift Amount:** The difference between the `input_first_nz_idx` and the `actual_output_start_idx` (the index of the first non-zero digit in the output) is consistently 4 for all examples.\n*   **Block Placement:** The calculated starting position for the block in the output (`input_first_nz_idx - 4`) perfectly matches the observed starting position (`actual_output_start_idx`).\n*   **Block Content:** The content of the extracted `input_block` matches the corresponding segment in the `output` sequence.\n*   **Padding:** Positions in the output sequence outside the placed block are filled with zeros.\n\n**Summary Table (from `tool_code` output):**\n\n| Example  | Input First NZ Idx | Input Last NZ Idx | Input Block         | Block Len | Calc Output Start | Actual Output Start | Actual Shift | Block Match |\n| :------- | :----------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :-------- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :----------- | :---------- |\n| train_1  | 4                  | 7                 | `[9, 3, 2, 5]`      | 4         | 0                 | 0                   | 4            | True        |\n| train_2  | 5                  | 10                | `[6, 8, 3, 4, 9, 8]`| 6         | 1                 | 1                   | 4            | True        |\n| train_3  | 6                  | 9                 | `[4, 6, 3, 4]`      | 4         | 2                 | 2                   | 4            | True        |\n| train_4  | 6                  | 8                 | `[8, 1, 7]`         | 3         | 2                 | 2                   | 4            | True        |\n| train_5  | 5                  | 11                | `[3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 7, 1]` | 7       | 1                 | 1                   | 4            | True        |\n| train_6  | 10                 | 11                | `[8, 1]`            | 2         | 6                 | 6                   | 4            | True        |\n| train_7  | 5                  | 7                 | `[2, 8, 7]`         | 3         | 1                 | 1                   | 4            | True        |\n\nThis analysis confirms the transformation rule is robust across the training set.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
