task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - representation: space-separated single digits in input/output strings
      - length: fixed (12 in all examples)
      - elements: single digits (0-9)
  - object: digit_block
    properties:
      - source: derived from input sequence
      - content: contiguous subsequence
      - definition: starts at the index of the first non-zero digit, ends at the index of the last non-zero digit (inclusive)
      - includes: all digits (zero and non-zero) within its defined start and end indices
  - object: index
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - role: 0-based position within a sequence
  - object: shift_amount
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 4 (constant based on examples)
      - direction: leftwards (output index < input index)
relationships_and_actions:
  - action: parse_input
    description: Convert the input string into a list of integers.
  - action: find_indices
    description: Identify the index of the first non-zero digit (`first_nz_idx`) and the last non-zero digit (`last_nz_idx`) in the input list.
    condition: If no non-zero digits exist, the output is a sequence of all zeros.
  - action: extract_block
    description: Extract the contiguous sub-list (the `digit_block`) from the input list, starting at `first_nz_idx` and ending at `last_nz_idx` (inclusive).
  - action: calculate_target_index
    description: Determine the starting index (`output_start_idx`) for the `digit_block` in the output sequence.
    formula: output_start_idx = first_nz_idx - shift_amount (where shift_amount is 4)
  - action: construct_output
    description: Create the output sequence.
    steps:
      - Initialize a new list of the same length as the input, filled with zeros.
      - Place the extracted `digit_block` into the new list starting at the calculated `output_start_idx`. Ensure placement respects the bounds of the list (though examples show blocks fit).
  - action: format_output
    description: Convert the resulting list of integers back into a space-separated string.
