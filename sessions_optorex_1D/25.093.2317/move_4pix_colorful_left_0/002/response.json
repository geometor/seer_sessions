            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The core transformation logic identified previously (finding the block between the first and last non-zero digits and shifting it left by 4 positions) appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples. The execution errors reported stemmed from a mismatch between the expected input format in the `transform` function (string) and the format likely used during testing (list or NumPy array). The fix involves adjusting the function to accept a list/array directly, removing the string parsing step.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The following metrics were derived by analyzing the input/output pairs and confirmed using the `code_execution` tool:\n\n    | Example | Input Sequence                                | First NZ Idx | Last NZ Idx | Extracted Block       | Output Start Idx (First NZ Idx - 4) | Expected Output Sequence                      | Logic Matches |\n    | :------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :----------- | :---------- | :-------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------ |\n    | train_1 | `[0,0,0,0,9,3,2,5,0,0,0,0]`                   | 4            | 7           | `[9,3,2,5]`           | 0                                   | `[9,3,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | Yes           |\n    | train_2 | `[0,0,0,0,0,6,8,3,4,9,8,0]`                   | 5            | 10          | `[6,8,3,4,9,8]`       | 1                                   | `[0,6,8,3,4,9,8,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | Yes           |\n    | train_3 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6,3,4,0,0]`                   | 6            | 9           | `[4,6,3,4]`           | 2                                   | `[0,0,4,6,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | Yes           |\n    | train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,7,0,0,0]`                   | 6            | 8           | `[8,1,7]`           | 2                                   | `[0,0,8,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | Yes           |\n    | train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,3,4,2,1,2,7,1]`                   | 5            | 11          | `[3,4,2,1,2,7,1]`     | 1                                   | `[0,3,4,2,1,2,7,1,0,0,0,0]`                   | Yes           |\n    | train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1]`                   | 10           | 11          | `[8,1]`             | 6                                   | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1,0,0,0,0]`                   | Yes           |\n    | train_7 | `[0,0,0,0,0,2,8,7,0,0,0,0]`                   | 5            | 7           | `[2,8,7]`           | 1                                   | `[0,2,8,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                   | Yes           |\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
