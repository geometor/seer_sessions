*   **General Assessment:**
    The core transformation logic identified previously (finding the block between the first and last non-zero digits and shifting it left by 4 positions) appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples. The execution errors reported stemmed from a mismatch between the expected input format in the `transform` function (string) and the format likely used during testing (list or NumPy array). The fix involves adjusting the function to accept a list/array directly, removing the string parsing step.

*   **Metrics:**
    The following metrics were derived by analyzing the input/output pairs and confirmed using the `code_execution` tool:

          - Initialize output_sequence of the correct length with all zeros.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of digits (as a list or array of integers).
    2.  Determine the length of the input sequence (`n`).
    3.  Find the index of the first non-zero digit in the input sequence (let this be `first_nz_idx`).
    4.  If no non-zero digit is found (`first_nz_idx` is None), create an output sequence of length `n` containing only zeros and return it.
    5.  Find the index of the last non-zero digit in the input sequence (let this be `last_nz_idx`).
    6.  Extract the contiguous sub-sequence (the "block") from the input sequence, starting at `first_nz_idx` and ending at `last_nz_idx` (inclusive).
    7.  Calculate the target starting index for this block in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from `first_nz_idx` (let this be `output_start_idx`).
    8.  Create a new sequence of length `n`, initially filled entirely with zeros (this is the `output_sequence`).
    9.  Determine the ending index for placing the block in the output sequence (`output_end_idx = output_start_idx + length_of_block`).
    10. Copy the extracted `block` into the `output_sequence` starting at `output_start_idx` and ending just before `output_end_idx`. Ensure indices stay within the bounds [0, n-1].
    11. Return the `output_sequence`.
