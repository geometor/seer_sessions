task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    role: input
    properties:
      - length: variable (consistently 12 in examples)
      - content: contains zeros and a core_block
  - object: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    role: output
    properties:
      - length: same as input sequence
      - content: derived from input sequence
  - object: core_block
    definition: contiguous subsequence starting with the first non-zero element and ending with the last non-zero element in the input sequence (inclusive of any intervening zeros)
    properties:
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index in the input sequence
      - content: sequence of integers from the input
  - object: zero
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: padding_element
  - action: identify_core_block
    input: input_sequence
    output: core_block, start_index, end_index
  - action: calculate_output_start_index
    input: start_index_of_core_block_in_input
    operation: subtract 4
    output: start_index_of_core_block_in_output
  - action: construct_output_sequence
    inputs:
      - sequence_length
      - core_block
      - output_start_index
    steps:
      - create a list of zeros with the given sequence_length
      - place the core_block into the list starting at output_start_index
    output: output_sequence
  - relationship: shift
    subject: core_block
    direction: left
    magnitude: 4 positions
    context: transformation from input sequence to output sequence
