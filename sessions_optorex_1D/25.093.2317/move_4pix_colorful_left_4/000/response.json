Each input sequence consists of integers, predominantly zeros, with a contiguous block of non-zero numbers (potentially containing zeros within that block). The transformation consistently involves shifting this \"core block\" of numbers to the left by a fixed amount within the sequence, while maintaining the overall sequence length by padding with zeros.\n\n1.  **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of integers.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence (all examples have length 12).\n3.  **Key Feature:** The presence of a contiguous block of numbers starting and ending with a non-zero number. Zeros before the first non-zero and after the last non-zero act as padding.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core block (from the first non-zero element to the last non-zero element, inclusive) is identified and moved leftwards.\n5.  **Shift Amount:** The leftward shift appears to be constant across all examples. Comparing the start index of the block in the input and output reveals a shift of 4 positions to the left (e.g., train_1: starts at index 7 -> starts at index 3; train_2: starts at index 8 -> starts at index 4; train_3: starts at index 4 -> starts at index 0).\n6.  **Padding:** The positions vacated by the shift on the right, and any positions before the new start index on the left, are filled with zeros.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
