"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers by identifying a 'core block' 
(from the first non-zero element to the last non-zero element, inclusive) 
and shifting this block 4 positions to the left within a new sequence of 
the same length, initialized with zeros. Zeros pad the sequence on the right 
after the shifted block. Elements shifted beyond the beginning (index < 0) 
or end (index >= length) of the sequence are discarded. The final output is 
returned as a list of integers.
