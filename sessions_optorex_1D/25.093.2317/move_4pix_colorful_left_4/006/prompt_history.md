Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves manipulating sequences of integers. Each input sequence consists of integers, predominantly zeros, with a contiguous block of non-zero numbers (potentially containing zeros within that block). The transformation consistently involves shifting this "core block" of numbers to the left by a fixed amount within the sequence, while maintaining the overall sequence length by padding with zeros.

1.  **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence (all examples have length 12).
3.  **Key Feature:** The presence of a contiguous block of numbers starting and ending with a non-zero number. Zeros before the first non-zero and after the last non-zero act as padding.
4.  **Transformation:** The core block (from the first non-zero element to the last non-zero element, inclusive) is identified and moved leftwards.
5.  **Shift Amount:** The leftward shift appears to be constant across all examples. Comparing the start index of the block in the input and output reveals a shift of 4 positions to the left (e.g., train_1: starts at index 7 -> starts at index 3; train_2: starts at index 8 -> starts at index 4; train_3: starts at index 4 -> starts at index 0).
6.  **Padding:** The positions vacated by the shift on the right, and any positions before the new start index on the left, are filled with zeros.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the input sequence of integers.
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero integer (`first_nz_idx`) and the index of the last non-zero integer (`last_nz_idx`) in the input sequence.
3.  If no non-zero integers are found, return the input sequence as is.
4.  Extract the "core block" subsequence from the input sequence, starting at `first_nz_idx` and ending at `last_nz_idx` (inclusive).
5.  Calculate the target starting index for the core block in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from `first_nz_idx`. Let this be `output_start_idx`.
6.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with zeros.
7.  Place the extracted core block into this new sequence, starting at the calculated `output_start_idx`.
8.  Return the newly constructed sequence.
