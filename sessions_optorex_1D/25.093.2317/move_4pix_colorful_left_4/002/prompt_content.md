Identifies a 'core block' of numbers in the input sequence (starting with the 
first non-zero and ending with the last non-zero). This core block is then 
shifted 4 positions to the left within a sequence of the same length, initialized 
with zeros. Zeros pad the sequence on the right after the shifted block.
