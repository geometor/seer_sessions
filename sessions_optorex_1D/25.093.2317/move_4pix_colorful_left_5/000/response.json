This corresponds to a cyclic shift or left rotation of the sequence.\n    *   Testing this hypothesis across all examples confirms that the output is consistently obtained by rotating the input sequence 4 positions to the left. For example, in `train_1`, the input `0 0 0 0 7 1 3 2 2 7 4 0` becomes `7 1 3 2 2 7 4 0 0 0 0 0` after moving the first four `0`s to the end. In `train_3`, `0 0 0 0 0 3 4 9 2 1 0 0` becomes `0 3 4 9 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0` after moving the first four `0`s to the end.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
