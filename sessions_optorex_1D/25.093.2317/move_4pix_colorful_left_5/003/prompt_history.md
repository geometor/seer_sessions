*   **Perception:**
    *   The input and output are both sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   The digits present in the output are the same as the digits in the input, but their order is changed.
    *   Comparing inputs and outputs, it appears the sequence is being shifted or rotated.
    *   Specifically, the first four elements of the input sequence seem to be moved to the end of the sequence in the output. This corresponds to a cyclic shift or left rotation of the sequence.
    *   Testing this hypothesis across all examples confirms that the output is consistently obtained by rotating the input sequence 4 positions to the left. For example, in `train_1`, the input `0 0 0 0 7 1 3 2 2 7 4 0` becomes `7 1 3 2 2 7 4 0 0 0 0 0` after moving the first four `0`s to the end. In `train_3`, `0 0 0 0 0 3 4 9 2 1 0 0` becomes `0 3 4 9 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0` after moving the first four `0`s to the end.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The previous code failed because it assumed the input `input_grid` was a string, while it was actually provided as a NumPy array. The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` confirms this type mismatch. The core logic identified (a cyclic left shift by 4 positions) appears correct based on the visual inspection of the examples, but the implementation needs to be adapted to operate on NumPy arrays. The strategy is to rewrite the transformation function using NumPy array slicing and concatenation instead of string methods.

*   **Metrics:**
    The code failed on all examples at the `input_grid.split(' ')` line due to the type mismatch. To confirm the input structure, let's inspect the properties of the input for `train_1`.
    

*code_execution:*
```python
    import numpy as np

    # Reconstruct the input for train_1 based on the problem description
    input_data_train_1 = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 1, 3, 2, 2, 7, 4, 0])

    print(f"Example train_1 input type: {type(input_data_train_1)}")
    print(f"Example train_1 input shape: {input_data_train_1.shape}")
    print(f"Example train_1 input dtype: {input_data_train_1.dtype}")
    print(f"Example train_1 input length: {len(input_data_train_1)}")

    # Expected output for train_1
    output_data_train_1 = np.array([7, 1, 3, 2, 2, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

    # Perform the intended shift using numpy to verify the logic
    shift_amount = 4
    shifted_array = np.roll(input_data_train_1, -shift_amount) # Negative shift for left rotation in np.roll

    print(f"Input (train_1): {input_data_train_1}")
    print(f"Expected Output (train_1): {output_data_train_1}")
    print(f"Calculated Shifted Output (train_1): {shifted_array}")
    print(f"Logic matches expected output: {np.array_equal(shifted_array, output_data_train_1)}")
    
```

outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example train_1 input type: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
Example train_1 input shape: (12,)
Example train_1 input dtype: int64
Example train_1 input length: 12

Calculated Shifted Output (train_1): [7 1 3 2 2 7 4 0 0 0 0 0]
Logic matches expected output: True

```
    The metrics confirm the input is a 1D NumPy array of shape (12,) containing integers. The `np.roll` function confirms that a left cyclic shift of 4 positions correctly transforms the input to the expected output for `train_1`. This reinforces the initial hypothesis about the transformation rule. The code needs to be updated to handle this NumPy array input format.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Take the input 1D NumPy array containing 12 integers.

    3.  The resulting array is the output.
