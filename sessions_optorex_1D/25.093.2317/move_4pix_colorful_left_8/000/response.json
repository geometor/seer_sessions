This block may also contain zeros if they fall between the first and last non-zero elements.\n4.  **Transformation:** The primary transformation is the shifting (movement) of this \"content block\" within the sequence.\n5.  **Padding:** The positions outside the moved content block in the output sequence are filled with zeros.\n6.  **Movement Pattern:** The content block appears to shift leftwards by a specific amount (4 positions), but it doesn't shift past the beginning of the sequence (index 0). The relative order of the numbers within the content block is preserved.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Scan the list to find the index of the first non-zero integer (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero integer (`end_index`).\n4.  If no non-zero integers are found, create an output list consisting of zeros with the same length as the input list, format it as a space-separated string, and return it.\n5.
