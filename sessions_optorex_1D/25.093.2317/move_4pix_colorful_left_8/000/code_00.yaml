Task: Shift a content block within a sequence of integers.

Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      Type: List of integers.
      Origin: Parsed from the input string.
      Properties:
        - length: The total number of integers in the sequence.
        - elements: Individual integer values at specific indices.
  - Output_Sequence:
      Type: List of integers.
      Destination: Formatted into the output string.
      Properties:
        - length: Same as Input_Sequence length.
        - elements: Derived from Input_Sequence based on transformation rule.
  - Content_Block:
      Type: Sub-list of integers.
      Origin: Extracted from Input_Sequence.
      Definition: The contiguous segment of the Input_Sequence starting at the index of the first non-zero integer and ending at the index of the last non-zero integer.
      Properties:
        - start_index_input: The index in Input_Sequence where the block begins.
        - end_index_input: The index in Input_Sequence where the block ends.
        - length: Number of elements in the block (end_index_input - start_index_input + 1).
        - elements: The sequence of integers within the block, preserving relative order.
  - Zero_Element:
      Type: Integer.
      Value: 0.
      Role: Acts as padding/background in the sequences.

Relationships:
  - Derivation: Output_Sequence is derived from Input_Sequence.
  - Extraction: Content_Block is extracted from Input_Sequence.
  - Preservation: The relative order of elements within the Content_Block is maintained from Input_Sequence to Output_Sequence.
  - Positioning: The starting position of the Content_Block in the Output_Sequence depends on its starting position in the Input_Sequence.

Actions:
  - Parse: Convert input string to Input_Sequence (list of integers).
  - Identify_Block: Find the start_index_input and end_index_input of the Content_Block by locating the first and last non-zero elements. Handle the case where no non-zero elements exist.
  - Extract: Create the Content_Block sub-list from Input_Sequence.
  - Calculate_Output_Start: Determine the target starting index for the Content_Block in the Output_Sequence using the rule: `output_start = max(0, start_index_input - 4)`.
  - Initialize_Output: Create an Output_Sequence of the same length as Input_Sequence, filled with zeros.
  - Place_Block: Copy the elements of the Content_Block into the Output_Sequence starting at the calculated `output_start` index.
  - Format: Convert the final Output_Sequence back to a space-separated string.
