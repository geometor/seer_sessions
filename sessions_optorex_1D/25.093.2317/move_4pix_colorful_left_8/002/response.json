            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe consistent error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples clearly indicates that the `transform` function is receiving a NumPy array as input, not the anticipated space-separated string. The previous perception and resulting code correctly identified the core transformation logic (finding a content block and shifting it left by 4, capped at index 0) but made an incorrect assumption about the input data type.\n\nThe strategy for resolution is straightforward:\n1.  Modify the function signature and internal logic to accept and operate directly on NumPy arrays.\n2.  Replace string/list-based operations (like `.split()`, list iteration for finding indices, list creation, `.join()`) with their NumPy equivalents (like `np.nonzero`, array slicing, `np.zeros`).\n3.  Ensure the function returns a NumPy array as required by the execution environment.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe primary metric revealed by the execution results is the input data type.\n*   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (for all examples)\n*   **Expected Input Type (Previous Code):** `str`\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError` (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) (for all examples)\n*   **Consistency:** The error is identical across all training and test examples, confirming the input type mismatch is universal for this task.\n\nNo further code execution is needed at this stage; the error messages provide sufficient information about the type mismatch.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"

Determine the minimum (`start_index_input`) and maximum (`end_index_input`) of these indices. Handle the case where no non-zero elements exist.\n  - Extract_Block: Create the Content_Block sub-array by slicing the Input_Array from `start_index_input` to `end_index_input` (inclusive).\n  - Calculate_Output_Start: Determine the target starting index (`output_start`) for the Content_Block in the Output_Array using the rule: `output_start = max(0, start_index_input - 4)`.\n  - Initialize_Output_Array: Create an Output_Array of the same shape and type as the Input_Array, filled with zeros (e.g., using `numpy.zeros_like`).\n  - Place_Block: Copy the elements of the Content_Block into the Output_Array starting at the calculated `output_start` index using array slicing assignment.\n  - Return_Array: Return the final Output_Array.\n```"
