**General Assessment:**

The provided results indicate that the previously generated code failed to correctly transform any of the examples. The `Transformed Output` consistently matches the `Input`, suggesting a potential bug in the execution or implementation of the previous transformation logic, where the shift operation was not applied.

However, by comparing the `Input` and `Expected Output` for each example, a clear and consistent transformation rule emerges. The core idea of shifting a block of content leftwards holds, but the definition of the "content block" and the placement logic need refinement based on the examples.

The strategy is to redefine the content block and verify the shift calculation against all provided examples. The block appears to start at the first non-zero element and has a maximum length of 8, including any subsequent zeros within that length limit. The leftward shift is consistently 4 positions, bounded by the start of the sequence (index 0).

**Metrics Analysis:**

We will analyze each example to determine the key parameters according to the revised hypothesis:
*   `N`: Length of the sequence (always 12).
*   `start_index`: Index of the first non-zero element in the input.
*   `block_len`: Length of the content block, calculated as `min(8, N - start_index)`.
*   `content_block`: The actual sub-sequence extracted from the input starting at `start_index` with length `block_len`.
*   `output_start`: The calculated starting index for the block in the output, `max(0, start_index - 4)`.
*   `expected_block_at_output_start`: The sub-sequence from the `Expected Output` at the calculated `output_start` position with length `block_len`.

**Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a specific content block within a sequence of integers leftwards.

Objects:
  - Input_Sequence:
      Type: List of integers (derived from space-separated string).
      Properties:
        - length (N): The total number of integers (e.g., 12).
        - elements: Integer values at specific indices.
  - Output_Sequence:
      Type: List of integers (formatted to space-separated string).
      Properties:
        - length (N): Same as Input_Sequence length.
        - elements: Derived from Input_Sequence based on transformation rule.
  - Content_Block:
      Type: Sub-list of integers.
      Origin: Extracted from Input_Sequence.
      Definition: The contiguous segment of the Input_Sequence starting at the index of the first non-zero integer (`start_index`).
      Properties:
        - start_index_input: The index in Input_Sequence where the block begins (first non-zero element). Null if all zeros.
        - length: The number of elements in the block, calculated as `min(8, N - start_index_input)`. If `start_index_input` is null, length is 0.
        - elements: The sequence of integers within the block (including any zeros within its calculated length).
  - Zero_Element:
      Type: Integer.
      Value: 0.
      Role: Acts as padding/background in the sequences and can be part of the Content_Block if it falls within the block's calculated length.

Relationships:
  - Derivation: Output_Sequence is derived from Input_Sequence.
  - Extraction: Content_Block is extracted from Input_Sequence based on `start_index_input` and calculated `length`.
  - Preservation: The relative order of elements within the Content_Block is maintained from Input_Sequence to Output_Sequence.
  - Positioning: The starting position of the Content_Block in the Output_Sequence (`output_start_index`) is determined by the `start_index_input`.

Actions:
  - Parse: Convert input string to Input_Sequence list.
  - Find_First_Non_Zero: Locate the index (`start_index_input`) of the first non-zero element in Input_Sequence. Handle the case where no non-zero elements exist.
  - Calculate_Block_Length: Determine the length of the Content_Block using `block_len = min(8, N - start_index_input)`.
  - Extract_Block: Create the Content_Block sub-list from Input_Sequence starting at `start_index_input` with the calculated `block_len`.
  - Calculate_Output_Start: Determine the target starting index for the Content_Block in the Output_Sequence using the rule: `output_start_index = max(0, start_index_input - 4)`.
  - Initialize_Output: Create an Output_Sequence of length N, filled with zeros.
  - Place_Block: Copy the elements of the Content_Block into the Output_Sequence starting at the calculated `output_start_index`.
  - Format: Convert the final Output_Sequence back to a space-separated string.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a string of space-separated integers.
2.  Convert the input string into a list of integers (`Input_Sequence`) of length `N`.
3.  Find the index of the first non-zero integer in `Input_Sequence`. Let this be `start_index`.
4.  If no non-zero integer is found (`start_index` does not exist):
    a. Create an `Output_Sequence` consisting of `N` zeros.
    b. Format `Output_Sequence` as a space-separated string and return it.
5.  If a non-zero integer is found at `start_index`:
    a. Calculate the length of the block to be moved: `block_len = min(8, N - start_index)`.
    b. Extract the sub-list (`Content_Block`) from `Input_Sequence` starting at `start_index` and continuing for `block_len` elements.
    c. Calculate the target starting index (`output_start`) for placing this block in the output: `output_start = max(0, start_index - 4)`.
    d. Create a new list (`Output_Sequence`) of length `N`, initially filled with zeros.
    e. Place the extracted `Content_Block` into `Output_Sequence`, starting at the `output_start` index. The elements of `Content_Block` will occupy indices from `output_start` up to `output_start + block_len - 1`.
    f. Convert `Output_Sequence` back into a string of space-separated integers.
    g. Return the resulting string.
