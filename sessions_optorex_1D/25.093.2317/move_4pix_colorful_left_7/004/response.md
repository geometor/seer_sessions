## General Assessment

The provided results indicate that the tested code (`code_00.py`) failed to implement the intended transformation. Instead of performing a circular left shift, it returned the input sequence unchanged for all examples. The "Pixels Off" and low "Score" values confirm this complete mismatch between the actual and expected outputs.

The initial analysis identified the transformation as a circular left shift by 4 positions, which aligns perfectly with the *expected* outputs provided in the examples. Therefore, the error lies not in the understanding of the transformation rule, but in the implementation or execution environment mismatch of the tested code. Specifically, the tested code likely did not correctly handle the input format (string) and output format (string), assuming it received a sequence type directly. The original code block containing parsing and formatting functions was likely closer to the correct implementation needed for the test harness.

The strategy is to:
1. Re-affirm the transformation rule (circular left shift by 4).
2. Update the documentation (YAML) and natural language program to explicitly include the necessary steps of parsing the input string into a sequence, performing the shift, and formatting the resulting sequence back into a string.

## Metrics Gathering

The transformation rule is consistently a circular left shift by 4 positions across all examples. Let's verify this programmatically for a couple of examples.

**Example 1 Verification:**
Input: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0`
Expected Output: `0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
Applying Left Shift 4:

``` python
import collections

input_str = "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0"
data = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]
shift = 4
d = collections.deque(data)
d.rotate(-shift) # Negative value rotates left
shifted_list = list(d)
output_str = " ".join(map(str, shifted_list))
print(f'{output_str=}')
```
```
output_str='0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0'

```
**Example 5 Verification:**
Input: `0 0 0 0 8 3 6 4 9 5 3 0`
Expected Output: `8 3 6 4 9 5 3 0 0 0 0 0`
Applying Left Shift 4:

``` python
import collections

input_str = "0 0 0 0 8 3 6 4 9 5 3 0"
data = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]
shift = 4
d = collections.deque(data)
d.rotate(-shift) # Negative value rotates left
shifted_list = list(d)
output_str = " ".join(map(str, shifted_list))
print(f'{output_str=}')
```
```
output_str='8 3 6 4 9 5 3 0 0 0 0 0'

```
The programmatic verification confirms that a circular left shift of 4 positions on the parsed input sequence yields the expected output string for these examples. The failure reported for `code_00.py` strongly suggests it did not perform these parsing, shifting, and formatting steps correctly within the test environment.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the input, which is a string containing 12 space-separated integers. Convert this string into a list (or equivalent sequence) of 12 integers.
2.  **Perform Circular Shift:** Apply a circular left shift operation to the list of integers by 4 positions. This means the first 4 elements move to the end of the list, and all other elements shift 4 positions to the left.
3.  **Format Output:** Convert the resulting shifted list of integers back into a string format, with integers separated by single spaces.
4.  **Output:** Return the formatted string.
