*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   All sequences (input and output) have the same length (12 elements).
    *   The core content consists of a contiguous block of digits that starts with the first non-zero digit and ends with the last non-zero digit in the input sequence. This block may contain internal zeros.
    *   The remaining elements are zeros, appearing before (leading) and after (trailing) the core block.
    *   The transformation involves repositioning the core block within the sequence.

## Example 1:

## General Assessment

The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a string) and the actual input type provided during testing (a NumPy array). The function attempted to use the string method `.split()` on a NumPy array, causing the failure.

The strategy for resolving this is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept and process NumPy arrays (or lists, as NumPy arrays can often be treated similarly for element access and slicing in this context). This involves removing the string-parsing step (`input_str.split()`) and adapting any necessary logic to operate on array elements or slices.

The core transformation logic hypothesized previously (identifying the first-to-last non-zero block and shifting it left by 4 positions, clamped at index 0) appears sound, as confirmed by simulating the logic on the NumPy array inputs.

## Metrics

The following metrics were gathered by applying the core transformation logic (adapted for NumPy arrays) to each training example:

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input sequence (a NumPy array of 12 integers).
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero element (`first_nz`).
3.  If no non-zero element is found (`first_nz` is -1), return the original input sequence.
4.  Find the index of the last non-zero element (`last_nz`).
5.  Extract the sub-sequence (the "core block") from index `first_nz` to `last_nz` (inclusive) from the input sequence.
6.  Calculate the target starting index (`new_start`) for placing the core block in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from `first_nz`, ensuring the result is not less than 0 (`new_start = max(0, first_nz - 4)`).
7.  Create a new sequence of 12 zeros (same type and length as input).
8.  Determine the number of elements from the core block that can fit into the new sequence starting at `new_start` without exceeding the sequence length (12).
9.  Copy that determined number of elements from the beginning of the core block into the new sequence, starting at the `new_start` index.
10. Return the new sequence.
