*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   All sequences (input and output) have the same length (12 elements).
    *   The core content consists of a contiguous block of digits that starts with the first non-zero digit and ends with the last non-zero digit in the input sequence. This block may contain internal zeros.
    *   The remaining elements are zeros, appearing before (leading) and after (trailing) the core block.
    *   The transformation involves repositioning the core block within the sequence.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment:**

The error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) across all examples clearly indicate that the input data type assumption was incorrect. The previous code expected a space-separated string, but the actual input appears to be a NumPy array (or potentially a list, which behaves similarly in this context). The core transformation logic—identifying the first and last non-zero elements, extracting the block between them, and shifting it left by 4 positions (or to index 0 if the shift goes negative)—seems consistent with the input/output pairs when applied to the sequence of numbers directly.

**Strategy:**

The primary step is to modify the understanding of the input format. Instead of expecting a string and parsing it, the program should directly work with the input sequence (assumed to be a list or NumPy array of integers). This involves removing the string splitting and joining operations from the transformation logic. The underlying algorithm of finding the non-zero block and shifting it remains the same.

**Metrics:**

The metrics gathered via code execution confirm the indices and calculated shifts based on the core logic:

*   **Example 1:** `first_nz=5`, `last_nz=11`, `core_block=[1, 9, 5, 9, 6, 3, 8]`, `new_start=1`. Output matches `[0, 1, 9, 5, 9, 6, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   **Example 2:** `first_nz=4`, `last_nz=7`, `core_block=[3, 6, 7, 6]`, `new_start=0`. Output matches `[3, 6, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   **Example 3:** `first_nz=10`, `last_nz=11`, `core_block=[3, 3]`, `new_start=6`. Output matches `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   **Example 4:** `first_nz=4`, `last_nz=9`, `core_block=[5, 6, 4, 1, 4, 8]`, `new_start=0`. Output matches `[5, 6, 4, 1, 4, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   **Example 5:** `first_nz=5`, `last_nz=5`, `core_block=[4]`, `new_start=1`. Output matches `[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   **Example 6:** `first_nz=4`, `last_nz=10`, `core_block=[3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 6, 5]`, `new_start=0`. Output matches `[3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
*   **Example 7:** `first_nz=5`, `last_nz=9`, `core_block=[5, 9, 4, 7, 7]`, `new_start=1`. Output matches `[0, 5, 9, 4, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

The transformation logic consistently explains the relationship between input and output across all examples, provided the input is treated as a sequence of numbers.

7.  Create a new sequence of 12 zeros (this will be the output sequence).
