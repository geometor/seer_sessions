*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The inputs and outputs are sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    *   All sequences (input and output) have the same length (12 elements).
    *   The core content consists of a contiguous block of digits that starts with the first non-zero digit and ends with the last non-zero digit in the input sequence. This block may contain internal zeros.
    *   The remaining elements are zeros, appearing before (leading) and after (trailing) the core block.
    *   The transformation involves repositioning the core block within the sequence.

*   **YAML Facts:**

      details:
        - identify the start index (first_nz) of the core_block in the input
        - calculate the new start index (new_start) for the core_block in the output: new_start = max(0, first_nz - 4)
        - place the core_block at the new_start index in an output sequence of the same length, initialized with zeros
        - the remaining positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros, effectively redistributing the original leading and trailing zeros.
    edge_case:
      - condition: input sequence contains only zeros
        output: return the input sequence unchanged

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The execution results show that the provided code (`code_00.py`) failed to produce the expected outputs, instead returning the original inputs. This indicates a failure in the code's execution or implementation, rather than an incorrect understanding of the core transformation logic derived previously.

A detailed analysis of the input/output pairs, confirmed by the `tool_code` metrics, reinforces the initial hypothesis: the transformation involves identifying a 'core block' (from the first non-zero digit to the last non-zero digit) and shifting this block left by exactly 4 positions. The shift is bounded, meaning the block's new starting position cannot be less than index 0.

The strategy is to disregard the erroneous execution results of `code_00.py` for refining the logic itself, and instead rely on the consistent pattern observed in the *expected* input/output pairs. We will refine the YAML facts and the natural language program based on this confirmed "shift left by 4, clamped at index 0" rule.

**Metrics:**

The `tool_code` analysis provided the following key metrics, validating the transformation rule across all examples:

| Example | Input `first_nz` | Input `last_nz` | Core Block Length | Expected `new_start` (`max(0, first_nz - 4)`) | Actual `new_start` in Output | Calculated Shift (`first_nz - actual_new_start`) |

  steps:
    - 1: Find the index of the first non-zero element in the `input_sequence`, `first_nz`.
    - 2: If `first_nz` is not found (sequence is all zeros), return the `input_sequence` unchanged.
    - 3: Find the index of the last non-zero element in the `input_sequence`, `last_nz`.
    - 4: Extract the `core_block` = `input_sequence[first_nz : last_nz + 1]`.
    - 5: Calculate the target starting index for the `core_block` in the `output_sequence`: `new_start = max(0, first_nz - 4)`.
    - 6: Initialize `output_sequence` as a list of 12 zeros.
    - 7: Determine the number of elements from `core_block` that can fit into `output_sequence` starting at `new_start`: `num_elements_to_copy = min(len(core_block), 12 - new_start)`.
    - 8: Copy the first `num_elements_to_copy` elements from `core_block` into `output_sequence` starting at index `new_start`. Specifically: `output_sequence[new_start : new_start + num_elements_to_copy] = core_block[0 : num_elements_to_copy]`.
    - 9: Return the `output_sequence`.
edge_case:
  - condition: input sequence contains only zeros.
    action: return the input sequence directly.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Examine the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Locate the index of the first non-zero integer (`first_nz`).
3.  If no non-zero integer is present, the task is complete; return the original sequence.
4.  If non-zero integers exist, locate the index of the last non-zero integer (`last_nz`).
5.  Identify the 'core block' as the contiguous sub-sequence from `first_nz` to `last_nz`, inclusive.
6.  Calculate the intended new starting index for this core block by subtracting 4 from `first_nz`.
7.  Adjust this new starting index: if it is less than 0, set it to 0. Call this final value `new_start`.
8.  Create a new sequence of 12 zeros.
9.  Copy the elements of the 'core block' into the new sequence, starting at the `new_start` index. Ensure that you do not attempt to write past the end of the 12-element new sequence; truncate the core block if necessary.
10. Return the newly constructed sequence.
