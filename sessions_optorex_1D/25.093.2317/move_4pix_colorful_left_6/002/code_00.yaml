task_elements:
  - item: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list or array of integers
      - length: 12
  - item: core_block
    properties:
      - type: sub-sequence
      - definition: contiguous elements from the first non-zero digit to the last non-zero digit (inclusive) in the input sequence
      - contains: digits (can include internal zeros)
  - item: surrounding_zeros
    properties:
      - type: sequence elements
      - value: 0
      - position: outside the core_block in the input; fill remaining positions in the output
transformation:
  action: shift_left_block
  target: core_block
  details:
    - receive the input sequence (list/array of 12 integers)
    - identify the index of the first non-zero element (first_nz)
    - if no non-zero element exists, return the input sequence
    - identify the index of the last non-zero element (last_nz)
    - extract the core_block from first_nz to last_nz (inclusive)
    - calculate the new starting index for the core_block in the output: new_start = max(0, first_nz - 4)
    - create a new output sequence of 12 zeros
    - place the extracted core_block into the output sequence starting at new_start
    - ensure the core_block does not write past the end of the 12-element output sequence
    - return the modified output sequence (list/array of 12 integers)
edge_case:
  - condition: input sequence contains only zeros
    output: return the input sequence unchanged
