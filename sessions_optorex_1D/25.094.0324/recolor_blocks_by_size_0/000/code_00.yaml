task_description: Transform sequences of 0s and 3s based on the relative lengths of contiguous groups of 3s.
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - contains_zeros: True
      - contains_threes: True (input only)
      - contains_ones: True (output only)
      - contains_twos: True (output only)
  - type: number
    value: 0
    role: separator/unchanged background
  - type: number
    value: 3
    role: input value subject to transformation
  - type: number
    value: 1
    role: output value replacing 3s
  - type: number
    value: 2
    role: output value replacing 3s
  - type: object
    name: group_of_threes
    description: A contiguous subsequence containing only the number 3.
    properties:
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer
      - length: integer (count of 3s)
      - order: position relative to other groups (e.g., first, second)
relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: group_of_threes (input)
    to: group_of_ones_or_twos (output)
    properties:
      - preserves_length: True
      - preserves_position: True
  - type: comparison
    objects: [group_of_threes (first), group_of_threes (second)]
    property: length
    determines: which output value (1 or 2) replaces each group.
actions:
  - name: identify_groups
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of group_of_threes objects (with properties like index, length)
    condition: Assumes exactly two groups exist in the input examples.
  - name: compare_lengths
    input: two group_of_threes objects (first and second)
    output: boolean (is first group longer than second?)
  - name: assign_output_values
    input: comparison_result, two group_of_threes objects
    output: mapping of input group to output value (1 or 2)
    rule: |
      If first group is longer, assign 1 to first group, 2 to second group.
      Otherwise (first group is shorter or equal), assign 2 to first group, 1 to second group.
  - name: construct_output
    input: input_sequence, group_assignments
    output: output_sequence
    process: |
      Initialize output as a copy of input.
      Iterate through identified groups.
      Replace the 3s within each group's range in the output sequence with the assigned output value (1 or 2).
      Keep 0s unchanged.
