The numbers `1` and `2` appear only in the output, replacing the `3`s.\n4.  **Grouping:** The non-zero numbers (`3` in the input, `1` and `2` in the output) occur in contiguous groups or runs.\n5.  **Transformation Focus:** The core transformation happens to the groups of `3`s. Zeros remain unchanged in their positions.\n6.  **Group Correspondence:** Each group of `3`s in the input corresponds to a group of either `1`s or `2`s in the output, maintaining the same length and position as the original group.\n7.  **Relational Aspect:** The value (`1` or `2`) assigned to replace a group of `3`s seems to depend on the relationship between the groups of `3`s within the same input sequence. Specifically, comparing the lengths of the groups appears crucial.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
