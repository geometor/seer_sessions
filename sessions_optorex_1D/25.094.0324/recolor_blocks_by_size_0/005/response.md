"""
Transforms a 1D sequence containing 0s and 3s by identifying two contiguous groups 
of 3s and replacing them based on their relative lengths. Zeros remain unchanged.

1. Identify all contiguous groups (subsequences) consisting solely of the number 3.
2. Assume exactly two such groups are found. Let Group1 be the first group (smaller start index) 
   and Group2 be the second group.
3. Compare the lengths of Group1 and Group2.
4. If Group1 is strictly longer than Group2, replace the 3s in Group1 with 1s and the 3s 
   in Group2 with 2s in the output.
5. Otherwise (if Group1 is shorter or equal in length to Group2), replace the 3s in 
   Group1 with 2s and the 3s in Group2 with 1s in the output.
6. Keep all 0s unchanged in their original positions.
