Zeros remain unchanged.\n\nThe transformation logic is as follows:\n1. Identify all contiguous groups (subsequences) consisting solely of the number 3.\n2. The logic specifically applies only when exactly two such groups are found. Let Group1 be \n   the group that appears first (smaller start index) and Group2 be the group that appears second.\n3. Compare the lengths of Group1 and Group2.\n4. If Group1 is strictly longer than Group2, replace the 3s in Group1 with 1s and the 3s \n   in Group2 with 2s in the output sequence.\n5. Otherwise (if Group1 is shorter than or equal in length to Group2), replace the 3s in \n   Group1 with 2s and the 3s in Group2 with 1s in the output sequence.\n6. Keep all 0s unchanged in their original positions.\n7. If the number of groups of 3s is not exactly two, the input sequence is returned unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_groups_of_threes(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds contiguous groups of the number 3 in a list or 1D array of numbers.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers: A list or 1D NumPy array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a group\n        and contains 'start' index (inclusive), 'end' index (inclusive), \n        and 'length'.
