task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 3]
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - constraint: same length as input_sequence
  - object: digit_zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
    relationship:
      - maps directly from input to output at the same position
  - object: digit_three
    properties:
      - value: 3
    relationship:
      - appears in contiguous groups in the input
      - is transformed to either 1 or 2 in the output
  - object: group_of_threes
    properties:
      - definition: a contiguous subsequence of only '3's within the input_sequence
      - attribute: length (number of '3's in the group)
      - attribute: start_index
      - attribute: end_index
    relationship:
      - there are exactly two such groups in each input example
      - the lengths of the two groups are always different in the examples
      - comparison: one group is 'longer', the other is 'shorter'
    action:
      - identify all such groups in the input
      - determine their lengths and positions
actions_on_groups:
  - action: map_longer_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the maximum length
    effect: replace all '3's within this group's range with '1's in the output_sequence
  - action: map_shorter_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the minimum length (among the two groups)
    effect: replace all '3's within this group's range with '2's in the output_sequence
