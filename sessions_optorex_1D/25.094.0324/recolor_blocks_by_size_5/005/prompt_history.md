Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input consists of sequences of digits, specifically '0' and '3'.
*   The output also consists of sequences of digits, specifically '0', '1', and '2'.
*   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
*   The digit '0' in the input seems to remain '0' in the output in the same position.
*   The digit '3' in the input is transformed into either '1' or '2' in the output.
*   The transformation of '3's depends on the contiguous groups (runs) they form.
*   In all examples, there are exactly two distinct contiguous groups of '3's.
*   The lengths of these groups determine whether they are replaced by '1's or '2's.
*   The longer group of '3's is replaced by '1's.
*   The shorter group of '3's is replaced by '2's.

**YAML Facts:**

      - attribute: length (number of '3's in the group)
      - attribute: start_index
      - attribute: end_index
    relationship:
      - there are exactly two such groups in each input example
      - the lengths of the two groups are always different in the examples
      - comparison: one group is 'longer', the other is 'shorter'
    action:
      - identify all such groups in the input
      - determine their lengths and positions
actions_on_groups:
  - action: map_longer_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the maximum length
    effect: replace all '3's within this group's range with '1's in the output_sequence
  - action: map_shorter_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the minimum length (among the two groups)
    effect: replace all '3's within this group's range with '2's in the output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous groups (sequences) consisting solely of the digit '3'. Record the start index, end index, and length of each group found.
3.  From the identified groups of '3's, determine which group has the maximum length and which has the minimum length. (Based on the examples, there will be exactly two groups with different lengths).
4.  Iterate through the indices corresponding to the longest group of '3's (from its start index to its end index). For each index in this range, set the value in the output sequence to '1'.
5.  Iterate through the indices corresponding to the shorter group of '3's (from its start index to its end index). For each index in this range, set the value in the output sequence to '2'.
6.  Leave all digits that were originally '0' in the input unchanged in the output sequence (this is implicitly handled by initializing the output as a copy and only modifying the '3's).
7.  Return the modified output sequence.

## Example 1:
Error: Input grid must be 1-dimensional
**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error message "Input grid must be 1-dimensional" consistently appears for all examples. This indicates the `transform` function, which expects a 1D NumPy array as input (`input_grid: np.ndarray`), received data in a different format during testing. The function's internal check `if input_grid.ndim != 1:` triggered the error.

The core transformation logic (identifying two groups of '3's, finding the longer and shorter, and replacing them with '1's and '2's respectively) developed from the initial analysis appears correct based on the input/output pairs, but it relies on the input being a 1D array.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Acknowledge Input Format:** Recognize that the provided examples are given as space-separated strings, but the Python function expects a 1D NumPy array. The transformation process must include converting the input string into this format *before* applying the core logic.
2.  **Validate Logic:** Assume the input format issue is resolved (i.e., the function receives a proper 1D NumPy array). Re-verify that the logic of finding two groups of 3s, comparing lengths, and replacing holds for all provided training examples.
3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to explicitly include the input format conversion step and reiterate the core transformation rule based on the 1D array representation.

**Metrics Gathering**

The primary metric from the failed tests is the error type and message: `ValueError: Input grid must be 1-dimensional`. This occurred for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example shown. This confirms a systematic issue with the input data format presented to the function during execution, not necessarily a flaw in the transformation *logic* itself, assuming the logic is applied to a correctly formatted 1D array.

Let's re-verify the group finding and replacement logic using `tool_code` simulating correct 1D array input for a few examples.

The simulation confirms that the core logic (finding two groups of 3s, replacing longer with 1s, shorter with 2s) correctly transforms the inputs to the expected outputs for all training examples *when* the input is treated as a 1D sequence/array. The errors encountered during execution were solely due to the `transform` function not receiving the input in the expected 1D NumPy array format.

  - object: digit_zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
    relationship:
      - maps directly from input_sequence_1d to output_sequence_1d at the same index.
  - object: digit_three
    properties:
      - value: 3
    relationship:
      - appears in contiguous groups (runs) in the input_sequence_1d.
      - is transformed to either 1 or 2 in the output_sequence_1d based on group properties.
  - object: group_of_threes
    properties:
      - definition: a contiguous subsequence of only '3's within the input_sequence_1d.
      - attribute: length (number of '3's in the group).
      - attribute: start_index.
      - attribute: end_index.
    relationship:
      - constraint: there are exactly two such groups in each valid input example.
      - constraint: the lengths of the two groups are always different in the examples.
      - comparison: one group is identified as 'longer', the other as 'shorter' based on length.
    action:
      - identify all such groups in the input_sequence_1d.
      - determine their lengths and positions (start/end indices).
transformation_rule:
  - step: Initialize the output_sequence_1d as a copy of the input_sequence_1d.
  - step: Identify the two distinct contiguous groups of '3's.
  - step: Compare the lengths of the two identified groups.
  - step: Map the longer group: For the indices corresponding to the group with the maximum length, set the values in the output_sequence_1d to 1.
  - step: Map the shorter group: For the indices corresponding to the group with the minimum length, set the values in the output_sequence_1d to 2.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Parse Input:** Receive the input as a string of space-separated digits. Convert this string into a 1-dimensional numerical array (e.g., a NumPy array or a list of integers) containing only 0s and 3s. Let this be `input_array`.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a copy of the `input_array`. Let this be `output_array`.
3.  **Find Groups:** Scan the `input_array` to locate all contiguous sequences (groups or runs) composed entirely of the number 3. For each group found, record its starting index, ending index, and its length (number of 3s).
4.  **Identify Specific Groups:** Based on the problem examples, confirm that exactly two such groups of 3s exist. Identify the group with the greater length (the 'longer' group) and the group with the lesser length (the 'shorter' group).
5.  **Transform Longer Group:** Modify the `output_array`: for all indices from the start index to the end index (inclusive) of the longer group, change the value at that index to 1.
6.  **Transform Shorter Group:** Modify the `output_array`: for all indices from the start index to the end index (inclusive) of the shorter group, change the value at that index to 2.
7.  **Format Output:** Convert the modified `output_array` back into a string of space-separated digits.
8.  **Return:** Return the resulting string.
