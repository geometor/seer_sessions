            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a string, based on the function definition `transform(input_str: str)`) and the actual data type being passed during testing (a NumPy array, `numpy.ndarray`).\n\nThe core logic derived from the initial examples (identifying two groups of '3's, replacing the longer group with '1's and the shorter group with '2's, leaving '0's unchanged) appears sound based on the initial perception. The failure is purely at the input interface level.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a 1D NumPy array directly as input (`input_grid: np.ndarray`).\n2.  Remove the initial string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).\n3.  Remove the final string formatting step (`\" \".join(...)`).\n4.  Ensure the function returns a NumPy array.\n5.  The helper function `find_groups_of_value` already correctly accepts a NumPy array, so it requires no changes.\n6.  Update the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to reflect the direct handling of NumPy arrays.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nSince the code failed during input processing for all examples, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic (group lengths, counts) were generated. The only metric is the consistent Type Error across all test cases, confirming the input type mismatch. No `tool_code` execution is needed to diagnose this specific error.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
