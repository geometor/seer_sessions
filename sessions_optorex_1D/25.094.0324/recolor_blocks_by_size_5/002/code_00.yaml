task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence of integers (e.g., list or numpy array)
      - allowed_values: [0, 3]
      - name: input_list
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: sequence of integers (e.g., list or numpy array)
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - constraint: same length as input_sequence
      - name: output_list
  - object: digit_zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
    relationship:
      - maps directly from input_list to output_list at the same position
  - object: digit_three
    properties:
      - value: 3
    relationship:
      - appears in contiguous groups in input_list
      - is transformed to either 1 or 2 in output_list based on group properties
  - object: group_of_threes
    properties:
      - definition: a contiguous subsequence of only 3s within input_list
      - attribute: length (number of 3s in the group)
      - attribute: start_index
      - attribute: end_index
    relationship:
      - count: exactly two such groups exist in each input example
      - comparison: one group is 'longer', the other is 'shorter' (lengths are distinct)
    action:
      - identify all such groups in input_list
      - determine their lengths and positions (start/end indices)
actions_on_groups:
  - action: map_longer_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the maximum length
    effect: replace all 3s within this group's index range with 1s in output_list
  - action: map_shorter_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the minimum length
    effect: replace all 3s within this group's index range with 2s in output_list
