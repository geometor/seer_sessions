"""
Transforms a 1D sequence of 0s and 3s according to the following rules:
1. Digits '0' remain '0'.
2. Identifies exactly two contiguous groups (runs) of '3's in the input sequence.
3. Replaces the '3's in the longer group with '1's.
4. Replaces the '3's in the shorter group with '2's.
The output sequence has the same length as the input.
