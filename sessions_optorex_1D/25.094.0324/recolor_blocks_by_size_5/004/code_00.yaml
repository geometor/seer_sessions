task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence_1d
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_format string after parsing and conversion
      - type: 1D numpy array of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 3]
  - object: output_sequence_1d
    properties:
      - type: 1D numpy array of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - constraint: same length as input_sequence_1d
  - object: digit_zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
    relationship:
      - maps directly from input_sequence_1d to output_sequence_1d at the same index.
  - object: digit_three
    properties:
      - value: 3
    relationship:
      - appears in contiguous groups (runs) in the input_sequence_1d.
      - is transformed to either 1 or 2 in the output_sequence_1d based on group properties.
  - object: group_of_threes
    properties:
      - definition: a contiguous subsequence of only '3's within the input_sequence_1d.
      - attribute: length (number of '3's in the group).
      - attribute: start_index.
      - attribute: end_index.
    relationship:
      - constraint: there are exactly two such groups in each valid input example.
      - constraint: the lengths of the two groups are always different in the examples.
      - comparison: one group is identified as 'longer', the other as 'shorter' based on length.
    action:
      - identify all such groups in the input_sequence_1d.
      - determine their lengths and positions (start/end indices).
transformation_rule:
  - step: Initialize the output_sequence_1d as a copy of the input_sequence_1d.
  - step: Identify the two distinct contiguous groups of '3's.
  - step: Compare the lengths of the two identified groups.
  - step: Map the longer group: For the indices corresponding to the group with the maximum length, set the values in the output_sequence_1d to 1.
  - step: Map the shorter group: For the indices corresponding to the group with the minimum length, set the values in the output_sequence_1d to 2.
