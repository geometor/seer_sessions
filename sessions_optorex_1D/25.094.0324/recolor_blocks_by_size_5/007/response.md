import numpy as np

"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array containing 0s and 3s according to the following rules:
1. Identifies exactly two contiguous groups (runs) of '3's in the input array.
2. Replaces the '3's in the longer group with '1's.
3. Replaces the '3's in the shorter group with '2's.
4. Digits '0' remain '0'.
The output array has the same shape and length as the input array. If exactly two groups of 3s are not found, the original array is returned.
