Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   The input consists of sequences of digits, specifically '0' and '3'.
*   The output also consists of sequences of digits, specifically '0', '1', and '2'.
*   The length of the input sequence is preserved in the output sequence.
*   The digit '0' in the input seems to remain '0' in the output in the same position.
*   The digit '3' in the input is transformed into either '1' or '2' in the output.
*   The transformation of '3's depends on the contiguous groups (runs) they form.
*   In all examples, there are exactly two distinct contiguous groups of '3's.
*   The lengths of these groups determine whether they are replaced by '1's or '2's.
*   The longer group of '3's is replaced by '1's.
*   The shorter group of '3's is replaced by '2's.

      - attribute: start_index
      - attribute: end_index
    relationship:
      - there are exactly two such groups in each input example
      - the lengths of the two groups are always different in the examples
      - comparison: one group is 'longer', the other is 'shorter'
    action:
      - identify all such groups in the input
      - determine their lengths and positions
actions_on_groups:
  - action: map_longer_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the maximum length
    effect: replace all '3's within this group's range with '1's in the output_sequence
  - action: map_shorter_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the minimum length (among the two groups)
    effect: replace all '3's within this group's range with '2's in the output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous groups (sequences) consisting solely of the digit '3'. Record the start index, end index, and length of each group found.
3.  From the identified groups of '3's, determine which group has the maximum length and which has the minimum length. (Based on the examples, there will be exactly two groups with different lengths).
4.  Iterate through the indices corresponding to the longest group of '3's (from its start index to its end index). For each index in this range, set the value in the output sequence to '1'.
5.  Iterate through the indices corresponding to the shorter group of '3's (from its start index to its end index). For each index in this range, set the value in the output sequence to '2'.
6.  Leave all digits that were originally '0' in the input unchanged in the output sequence (this is implicitly handled by initializing the output as a copy and only modifying the '3's).
7.  Return the modified output sequence.

Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently occurs across all examples. This indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type of the `transform` function (a string, based on the function definition `transform(input_str: str)`) and the actual data type being passed during testing (a NumPy array, `numpy.ndarray`).

The core logic derived from the initial examples (identifying two groups of '3's, replacing the longer group with '1's and the shorter group with '2's, leaving '0's unchanged) appears sound based on the initial perception. The failure is purely at the input interface level.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a 1D NumPy array directly as input (`input_grid: np.ndarray`).
2.  Remove the initial string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).
3.  Remove the final string formatting step (`" ".join(...)`).
4.  Ensure the function returns a NumPy array.
5.  The helper function `find_groups_of_value` already correctly accepts a NumPy array, so it requires no changes.
6.  Update the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) to reflect the direct handling of NumPy arrays.

**Metrics Gathering**

Since the code failed during input processing for all examples, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic (group lengths, counts) were generated. The only metric is the consistent Type Error across all test cases, confirming the input type mismatch. No `tool_code` execution is needed to diagnose this specific error.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_grid
    properties:
      - type: 1D numpy array
      - element_type: integer
      - allowed_values: [0, 3]
  - object: output_grid
    properties:
      - type: 1D numpy array
      - element_type: integer
      - allowed_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - constraint: same shape and length as input_grid
  - object: digit_zero
    properties:
      - value: 0
    relationship:
      - maps directly from input_grid to output_grid at the same index
  - object: digit_three
    properties:
      - value: 3
    relationship:
      - appears in contiguous groups in the input_grid
      - is transformed to either 1 or 2 in the output_grid
  - object: group_of_threes
    properties:
      - definition: a contiguous subsequence of only '3's within the input_grid
      - attribute: length (number of '3's in the group)
      - attribute: start_index
      - attribute: end_index
    relationship:
      - there are exactly two such groups in each valid input example
      - the lengths of the two groups are different
      - comparison: one group is 'longer', the other is 'shorter'
    action:
      - identify all such groups in the input_grid using their indices and lengths
actions_on_groups:
  - action: map_longer_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the maximum length
    effect: replace elements with value '3' within this group's index range with '1's in the output_grid
  - action: map_shorter_group
    condition: applies to the group_of_threes with the minimum length
    effect: replace elements with value '3' within this group's index range with '2's in the output_grid
processing_flow:
  - step: 1. Receive the input_grid (1D NumPy array).
  - step: 2. Create a copy of the input_grid as the initial output_grid.
  - step: 3. Find all contiguous groups of value '3' in the input_grid.
  - step: 4. Check if exactly two groups were found.
  - step: 5. If two groups found, identify the longer and shorter groups based on length.
  - step: 6. Modify the output_grid by replacing '3's with '1's at the indices of the longer group.
  - step: 7. Modify the output_grid by replacing '3's with '2's at the indices of the shorter group.
  - step: 8. Return the modified output_grid.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept a 1D NumPy array, `input_grid`, containing integers 0 and 3.
2.  Create a copy of `input_grid` named `output_grid`.
3.  Identify all contiguous groups (runs) of the value 3 within `input_grid`. For each group, determine its starting index, ending index, and length.
4.  Verify that exactly two groups of 3s were found.
5.  If two groups are found, compare their lengths to identify the group with the maximum length ('longer group') and the group with the minimum length ('shorter group').
6.  For the index range corresponding to the 'longer group' (from its start index to its end index, inclusive), update the values in `output_grid` at these indices to 1.
7.  For the index range corresponding to the 'shorter group' (from its start index to its end index, inclusive), update the values in `output_grid` at these indices to 2.
8.  If exactly two groups were not found, return the `output_grid` without performing the replacements described in steps 6 and 7 (it will be identical to the `input_grid`).
9.  Return the final `output_grid`.
