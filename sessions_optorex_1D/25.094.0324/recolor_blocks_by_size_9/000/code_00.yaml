objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: Represents both the input and output data structures.
  - name: segment
    type: contiguous sub-sequence of identical digits
    description: The sequence can be broken down into segments (e.g., [0, 0], [3, 3, 3], [0]).
  - name: group_of_zeros
    type: segment
    properties:
      - value: 0
    description: A segment consisting only of zeros.
  - name: group_of_threes
    type: segment
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - length: integer (number of digits in the group)
      - order: integer (1st, 2nd group of threes encountered)
    description: A segment consisting only of threes. The examples provided always contain exactly two such groups.

relationships:
  - type: comparison
    between: [group_of_threes (order 1), group_of_threes (order 2)]
    property: length
    result: determines which group transforms to '1's and which to '2's.

actions:
  - name: identify_segments
    input: sequence
    output: list of segments
    description: Break the input sequence into contiguous segments of identical digits.
  - name: filter_groups_of_threes
    input: list of segments
    output: ordered list of group_of_threes (Group 1, Group 2)
    description: Extract the segments containing only '3's, preserving their order of appearance.
  - name: compare_lengths
    input: [Group 1, Group 2]
    output: comparison result (Group 1 shorter, Group 1 longer)
    description: Compare the lengths of the two identified groups of threes.
  - name: transform_group
    input: group_of_threes, target_digit (1 or 2)
    output: segment (of target_digit with same length)
    description: Replace a group of threes with a segment of the same length, filled with the target digit.
  - name: preserve_zeros
    input: group_of_zeros
    output: group_of_zeros
    description: Groups of zeros remain unchanged.
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    input: list of transformed/preserved segments
    output: final output sequence
    description: Combine the segments back in their original order.
