The output sequences contain '0', '1', and '2'. The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the input sequence.\n\nThe digit '0' appears to act as a separator and remains unchanged in the output. The transformation rule applies specifically to contiguous groups (or runs) of the digit '3'. All examples show exactly two such groups of '3's separated by '0's.\n\nThe core logic involves identifying these two groups of '3's, comparing their lengths, and then replacing each group with a sequence of either '1's or '2's based on this comparison. The group that appeared first in the input sequence (left-to-right) is designated as Group 1, and the second as Group 2. The replacement value ('1' or '2') depends on whether Group 1 is shorter or longer than Group 2.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
