**Perception:**

The input and output consist of sequences of single digits. The input sequences contain only the digits '0' and '3'. The output sequences contain '0', '1', and '2'. The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the input sequence.

The digit '0' appears to act as a separator and remains unchanged in the output. The transformation rule applies specifically to contiguous groups (or runs) of the digit '3'. All examples show exactly two such groups of '3's separated by '0's.

The core logic involves identifying these two groups of '3's, comparing their lengths, and then replacing each group with a sequence of either '1's or '2's based on this comparison. The group that appeared first in the input sequence (left-to-right) is designated as Group 1, and the second as Group 2. The replacement value ('1' or '2') depends on whether Group 1 is shorter or longer than Group 2.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Process the input sequence from left to right to identify contiguous segments of identical digits.
2.  Isolate the segments that consist solely of the digit '3'. Label these segments as `Group 1` and `Group 2` based on their order of appearance in the input sequence. (The provided examples always have exactly two such groups).
3.  Keep track of the segments consisting solely of the digit '0'; these will remain unchanged.
4.  Compare the length (number of digits) of `Group 1` with the length of `Group 2`.
5.  If the length of `Group 1` is less than the length of `Group 2`:
    a.  Replace every '3' in `Group 1` with the digit '2'.
    b.  Replace every '3' in `Group 2` with the digit '1'.
6.  If the length of `Group 1` is greater than the length of `Group 2`:
    a.  Replace every '3' in `Group 1` with the digit '1'.
    b.  Replace every '3' in `Group 2` with the digit '2'.
7.  (Handle the case where lengths are equal, if necessary, though not present in examples. A default might be G1->1, G2->2 or vice versa).
8.  Reconstruct the output sequence by concatenating the preserved '0' segments and the newly transformed '1' or '2' segments in their original order.
```python
import math
import re # Using regex might simplify finding groups

"""
Identifies contiguous groups of the digit '3' in the input sequence.
Compares the lengths of the first two such groups found.
If the first group is shorter than the second, replaces the first group with '2's and the second with '1's.
Otherwise (if the first group is longer or equal in length to the second), replaces the first group with '1's and the second with '2's.
Digits '0' remain unchanged.
The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
