"""
Transforms an input sequence containing 0s and 3s based on the lengths of contiguous groups of 3s.

Rule:
1.  Identify all distinct contiguous groups (runs) of the number 3 in the input sequence. Assume there are exactly two such groups.
2.  Convert the input (potentially a NumPy array) to a Python list.
3.  Compare the lengths of the two groups.
4.  Elements corresponding to the longer group of 3s in the input are replaced with 1s in the output sequence.
5.  Elements corresponding to the shorter group of 3s in the input are replaced with 2s in the output sequence.
6.  Elements that are 0 in the input remain 0 in the output.
7.  If the two groups of 3s have the same length, the group that appears earlier in the sequence (smaller start index) is treated as the 'longer' one (mapped to 1s).
