Objects:
  - InputSequence: A list of integers (0s and 3s).
  - OutputSequence: A list of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s), same length as InputSequence.
  - Number_0: An integer value that acts as a separator and remains unchanged.
  - Number_3: An integer value that is subject to transformation.
  - GroupOf3s: A contiguous subsequence within InputSequence consisting only of the number 3.
  - TransformationValue: The integer (1 or 2) used to replace a GroupOf3s.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: The number of elements in InputSequence and OutputSequence.
  - GroupLength: The number of 3s in a GroupOf3s.
  - GroupPosition: The starting and ending indices of a GroupOf3s in the InputSequence.
  - GroupOrder: The sequential index (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) of a GroupOf3s based on its appearance from left to right.

Relationships:
  - Separation: GroupsOf3s are separated by one or more Number_0s.
  - Correspondence: Each position in InputSequence corresponds to the same position in OutputSequence.
  - Alternation: The TransformationValue assigned to consecutive GroupsOf3s alternates between 1 and 2.
  - Dependency: The initial TransformationValue (for the first group) depends on the relative lengths of the first two GroupsOf3s.

Actions:
  - IdentifyGroups: Scan the InputSequence to find all GroupsOf3s and their properties (length, position, order).
  - CompareLengths: Compare the GroupLength of the first group (G1) with the GroupLength of the second group (G2), if G2 exists.
  - DetermineInitialValue: Assign the initial TransformationValue (P1) based on the length comparison (P1=1 if len(G1) > len(G2), else P1=2). Handle the case where only one group exists (P1=1).
  - AssignAlternatingValues: Assign TransformationValues to subsequent groups by alternating (P2 is the opposite of P1, P3 is the same as P1, etc.).
  - ReplaceNumbers: Construct the OutputSequence by keeping Number_0s and replacing the 3s within each GroupOf3s with its assigned TransformationValue.
