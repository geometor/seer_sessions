**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of integers. The input sequences consist only of the integers `0` and `3`. The output sequences consist of integers `0`, `1`, and `2`. The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.

The core transformation focuses on contiguous blocks or "groups" of the number `3`. The number `0` acts as a separator between these groups and remains unchanged in the output. Each group of `3`s in the input is replaced entirely by either `1`s or `2`s in the output.

The specific replacement value (`1` or `2`) for each group depends on an alternating pattern. This pattern itself is initialized based on a comparison of the lengths of the first two groups of `3`s found in the sequence.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputSequence: A list of integers (0s and 3s).
  - OutputSequence: A list of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s), same length as InputSequence.
  - Number_0: An integer value that acts as a separator and remains unchanged.
  - Number_3: An integer value that is subject to transformation.
  - GroupOf3s: A contiguous subsequence within InputSequence consisting only of the number 3.
  - TransformationValue: The integer (1 or 2) used to replace a GroupOf3s.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: The number of elements in InputSequence and OutputSequence.
  - GroupLength: The number of 3s in a GroupOf3s.
  - GroupPosition: The starting and ending indices of a GroupOf3s in the InputSequence.
  - GroupOrder: The sequential index (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) of a GroupOf3s based on its appearance from left to right.

Relationships:
  - Separation: GroupsOf3s are separated by one or more Number_0s.
  - Correspondence: Each position in InputSequence corresponds to the same position in OutputSequence.
  - Alternation: The TransformationValue assigned to consecutive GroupsOf3s alternates between 1 and 2.
  - Dependency: The initial TransformationValue (for the first group) depends on the relative lengths of the first two GroupsOf3s.

Actions:
  - IdentifyGroups: Scan the InputSequence to find all GroupsOf3s and their properties (length, position, order).
  - CompareLengths: Compare the GroupLength of the first group (G1) with the GroupLength of the second group (G2), if G2 exists.
  - DetermineInitialValue: Assign the initial TransformationValue (P1) based on the length comparison (P1=1 if len(G1) > len(G2), else P1=2). Handle the case where only one group exists (P1=1).
  - AssignAlternatingValues: Assign TransformationValues to subsequent groups by alternating (P2 is the opposite of P1, P3 is the same as P1, etc.).
  - ReplaceNumbers: Construct the OutputSequence by keeping Number_0s and replacing the 3s within each GroupOf3s with its assigned TransformationValue.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous groups of the number `3`. Record the start index, end index, and length for each group found. Store these groups in a list, maintaining their order of appearance.
3.  If no groups of `3`s are found, copy the input sequence (which must be all `0`s) to the output sequence and terminate.
4.  Determine the initial transformation value (`P1`) for the first group (`G1`):
    a.  If there is only one group (`G1`), set `P1 = 1`.
    b.  If there are two or more groups (`G1`, `G2`, ...):
        i.  Compare the length of
