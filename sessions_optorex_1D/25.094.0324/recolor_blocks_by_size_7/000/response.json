The output sequences consist of integers `0`, `1`, and `2`. The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.\n\nThe core transformation focuses on contiguous blocks or \"groups\" of the number `3`. The number `0` acts as a separator between these groups and remains unchanged in the output. Each group of `3`s in the input is replaced entirely by either `1`s or `2`s in the output.\n\nThe specific replacement value (`1` or `2`) for each group depends on an alternating pattern. This pattern itself is initialized based on a comparison of the lengths of the first two groups of `3`s found in the sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
