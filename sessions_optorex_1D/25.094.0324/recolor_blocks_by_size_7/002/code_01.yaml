Objects:
  - InputSequence: A sequence (list or array) of integers, containing only 0s and 3s.
  - OutputSequence: A sequence (list or array) of integers, containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s, with the same length as InputSequence.
  - Number_0: An integer value (0) that acts as a separator and remains unchanged during transformation.
  - Number_3: An integer value (3) that is transformed into either 1 or 2.
  - GroupOf3s: A contiguous subsequence within InputSequence consisting only of the number 3. Identified by start index, end index, and length.
  - TransformationValue: The integer (1 or 2) used to replace all 3s within a specific GroupOf3s.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: The number of elements in InputSequence and OutputSequence.
  - GroupLength: The number of 3s in a GroupOf3s.
  - GroupOrder: The sequential index (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) of a GroupOf3s based on its appearance from left to right in the InputSequence.

Relationships:
  - Separation: GroupsOf3s are separated by one or more Number_0s.
  - Correspondence: Each position in InputSequence corresponds to the same position in OutputSequence.
  - Alternation: The TransformationValue assigned to consecutive GroupsOf3s alternates between 1 and 2 (1 -> 2, 2 -> 1).
  - InitialValueDependency: The TransformationValue for the first GroupOf3s (G1) depends on the relative lengths of G1 and the second GroupOf3s (G2):
      - If only G1 exists, its TransformationValue is 1.
      - If G1 and G2 exist:
          - If length(G1) > length(G2), G1's TransformationValue is 1.
          - If length(G1) <= length(G2), G1's TransformationValue is 2.

Actions:
  - IdentifyGroups: Scan the InputSequence to find all GroupsOf3s, recording their start index, end index, and length. Maintain their order.
  - DetermineInitialValue:
      - Check the number of identified groups.
      - If 0 groups, return the input sequence unchanged.
      - If 1 group, set the initial TransformationValue to 1.
      - If 2 or more groups, compare the lengths of the first two groups (G1, G2) and set the initial TransformationValue (1 if len(G1) > len(G2), else 2).
  - AssignAlternatingValues: Iterate through the identified groups. Assign the determined initial TransformationValue to the first group. For each subsequent group, assign the opposite TransformationValue to the one assigned to the previous group.
  - ConstructOutput: Create the OutputSequence by copying the InputSequence. Then, for each identified GroupOf3s, replace the elements within its start and end indices with its assigned TransformationValue.
