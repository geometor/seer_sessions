"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 3s based on contiguous groups of 3s.

1. Identifies contiguous groups of the number 3 in the input sequence. 0s act as separators and remain unchanged.
2. Determines an initial transformation value (1 or 2) for the first group of 3s based on the lengths of the first two groups:
   - If only one group exists, the value is 1.
   - If the first group is strictly longer than the second, the value is 1.
   - Otherwise (first group is shorter or equal in length to the second), the value is 2.
3. Assigns transformation values (1 or 2) to subsequent groups by alternating from the initial value (1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 1).
4. Constructs the output sequence by replacing the 3s within each group with its assigned transformation value, while keeping the 0s unchanged.
