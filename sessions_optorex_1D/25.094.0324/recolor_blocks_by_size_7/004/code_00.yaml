Objects:
  - InputSequence: A list of integers consisting of 0s and 3s.
  - OutputSequence: A list of integers consisting of 0s, 1s, and 2s, having the same length as the InputSequence.
  - Number_0: An integer value (0) that acts as a separator and remains unchanged during transformation.
  - Number_3: An integer value (3) that is transformed into 1 or 2 based on group context.
  - GroupOf3s: A contiguous subsequence within InputSequence consisting solely of the number 3. Identified by start index, end index, and length.
  - TransformationValue: The integer (1 or 2) used to replace all 3s within a specific GroupOf3s.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: The number of elements in InputSequence and OutputSequence (they are identical).
  - GroupOrder: The sequential order (1st, 2nd, 3rd...) in which groups of 3s appear in the InputSequence from left to right.
  - GroupLength: The count of 3s within a GroupOf3s.
  - FirstGroup (G1): The GroupOf3s with GroupOrder=1.
  - SecondGroup (G2): The GroupOf3s with GroupOrder=2 (if it exists).
  - InitialTransformationValue: The TransformationValue assigned to the FirstGroup.
  - SubsequentTransformationValue: The TransformationValue assigned to groups other than the FirstGroup.

Relationships:
  - Correspondence: Each element at index `i` in InputSequence corresponds to the element at index `i` in OutputSequence.
  - Invariance: Number_0s in InputSequence map directly to Number_0s at the same positions in OutputSequence.
  - Replacement: All Number_3s within a specific GroupOf3s in InputSequence are replaced by the *same* TransformationValue (either 1 or 2) in the OutputSequence.
  - Alternation: The TransformationValue alternates between 1 and 2 for consecutive groups based on their GroupOrder. If G1 gets value `V`, G2 gets `3-V`, G3 gets `V`, G4 gets `3-V`, and so on.
  - InitialValueDependency: The InitialTransformationValue depends on the lengths of the FirstGroup (G1) and SecondGroup (G2):
      - If only G1 exists: InitialTransformationValue is 1.
      - If G1 and G2 exist:
          - If length(G1) > length(G2): InitialTransformationValue is 1.
          - If length(G1) <= length(G2): InitialTransformationValue is 2.

Actions:
  - IdentifyGroups: Scan InputSequence to find all GroupsOf3s, recording their start index, end index, length, and GroupOrder.
  - DetermineInitialValue: Calculate the InitialTransformationValue based on the InitialValueDependency rule (comparing lengths of G1 and G2, or handling the single-group case).
  - AssignTransformationValues: Starting with the InitialTransformationValue for G1, assign alternating values (1 then 2 then 1... or 2 then 1 then 2...) to all identified groups according to their GroupOrder.
  - ConstructOutput: Create the OutputSequence by:
      - Copying Number_0s from InputSequence directly.
      - Replacing Number_3s within each GroupOf3s with the TransformationValue assigned to that group.
