**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of integers. The input sequences consist only of the integers `0` and `3`. The output sequences consist of integers `0`, `1`, and `2`. The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.

The core transformation focuses on contiguous blocks or "groups" of the number `3`. The number `0` acts as a separator between these groups and remains unchanged in the output. Each group of `3`s in the input is replaced entirely by either `1`s or `2`s in the output.

The specific replacement value (`1` or `2`) for each group depends on an alternating pattern. This pattern itself is initialized based on a comparison of the lengths of the first two groups of `3`s found in the sequence.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Objects:
  - InputSequence: A list of integers (0s and 3s).
  - OutputSequence: A list of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s), same length as InputSequence.
  - Number_0: An integer value that acts as a separator and remains unchanged.
  - Number_3: An integer value that is subject to transformation.
  - GroupOf3s: A contiguous subsequence within InputSequence consisting only of the number 3.
  - TransformationValue: The integer (1 or 2) used to replace a GroupOf3s.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: The number of elements in InputSequence and OutputSequence.
  - GroupLength: The number of 3s in a GroupOf3s.
  - GroupPosition: The starting and ending indices of a GroupOf3s in the InputSequence.
  - GroupOrder: The sequential index (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) of a GroupOf3s based on its appearance from left to right.

Relationships:
  - Separation: GroupsOf3s are separated by one or more Number_0s.
  - Correspondence: Each position in InputSequence corresponds to the same position in OutputSequence.
  - Alternation: The TransformationValue assigned to consecutive GroupsOf3s alternates between 1 and 2.
  - Dependency: The initial TransformationValue (for the first group) depends on the relative lengths of the first two GroupsOf3s.

Actions:
  - IdentifyGroups: Scan the InputSequence to find all GroupsOf3s and their properties (length, position, order).
  - CompareLengths: Compare the GroupLength of the first group (G1) with the GroupLength of the second group (G2), if G2 exists.
  - DetermineInitialValue: Assign the initial TransformationValue (P1) based on the length comparison (P1=1 if len(G1) > len(G2), else P1=2). Handle the case where only one group exists (P1=1).
  - AssignAlternatingValues: Assign TransformationValues to subsequent groups by alternating (P2 is the opposite of P1, P3 is the same as P1, etc.).
  - ReplaceNumbers: Construct the OutputSequence by keeping Number_0s and replacing the 3s within each GroupOf3s with its assigned TransformationValue.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous groups of the number `3`. Record the start index, end index, and length for each group found. Store these groups in a list, maintaining their order of appearance.
3.  If no groups of `3`s are found, copy the input sequence (which must be all `0`s) to the output sequence and terminate.
4.  Determine the initial transformation value (`P1`) for the first group (`G1`):
    a.  If there is only one group (`G1`), set `P1 = 1`.
    b.  If there are two or more groups (`G1`, `G2`, ...):
        i.  Compare the length of

"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 3s based on contiguous groups of 3s.

1. Identifies contiguous groups of the number 3 in the input sequence. 0s act as separators.
2. Determines an initial transformation value (1 or 2) for the first group of 3s based on the lengths of the first two groups:
   - If only one group exists, the value is 1.
   - If the first group is longer than the second, the value is 1.
   - Otherwise (first group is shorter or equal in length to the second), the value is 2.
3. Assigns transformation values (1 or 2) to subsequent groups by alternating from the initial value.
4. Constructs the output sequence by replacing the 3s within each group with its assigned transformation value, while keeping the 0s unchanged.
