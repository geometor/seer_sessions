Objects:
  - InputSequence: A list of integers consisting solely of 0s and 3s.
  - OutputSequence: A list of integers consisting of 0s, 1s, and 2s, having the same length as the InputSequence.
  - SeparatorElement: The integer 0, which remains unchanged and separates groups.
  - TargetElement: The integer 3, which is part of groups to be transformed.
  - GroupOfTarget: A contiguous subsequence within InputSequence composed entirely of TargetElement (3).
  - TransformationValue: The integer (1 or 2) used to replace TargetElements within a GroupOfTarget.

Properties:
  - SequenceLength: The total number of elements in the InputSequence/OutputSequence.
  - GroupStartIndex: The 0-based index where a GroupOfTarget begins in the InputSequence.
  - GroupEndIndex: The 0-based index where a GroupOfTarget ends in the InputSequence.
  - GroupLength: The number of TargetElements (3s) in a GroupOfTarget.
  - GroupOrder: The sequential position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) of a GroupOfTarget as it appears from left to right in the InputSequence.
  - InitialTransformationValue: The TransformationValue assigned to the first GroupOfTarget (G1).

Relationships:
  - Identity: SeparatorElements (0s) in the InputSequence map directly to the same value at the same position in the OutputSequence.
  - GroupMapping: Each GroupOfTarget in the InputSequence corresponds to a segment in the OutputSequence where the original TargetElements (3s) are replaced by a single TransformationValue (1 or 2).
  - Alternation: The TransformationValue assigned to consecutive GroupOfTargets alternates between 1 and 2. (e.g., if G1 maps to 1, G2 maps to 2, G3 maps to 1, ...).
  - LengthDependency: The InitialTransformationValue depends on the relative GroupLengths of the first (G1) and second (G2) GroupOfTargets.

Actions:
  - FindGroups: Identify all GroupOfTargets in the InputSequence, recording their start index, end index, and length. Maintain the order of appearance.
  - DetermineInitialValue:
    - If zero or one GroupOfTarget exists, handle appropriately (if zero groups, output is same as input; if one group (G1), InitialTransformationValue is 1).
    - If two or more groups exist (G1, G2, ...), compare GroupLength(G1) and GroupLength(G2).
    - Assign InitialTransformationValue = 1 if GroupLength(G1) > GroupLength(G2).
    - Assign InitialTransformationValue = 2 if GroupLength(G1) <= GroupLength(G2).
  - AssignGroupValues: Assign a TransformationValue to each GroupOfTarget, starting with the InitialTransformationValue for G1 and alternating for subsequent groups (G2 gets the opposite of G1, G3 gets the same as G1, etc.).
  - ConstructOutput: Create the OutputSequence by copying SeparatorElements (0s) from the InputSequence and replacing TargetElements (3s) within each GroupOfTarget with that group's assigned TransformationValue.
