Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Data Format:** Both input and output are sequences (or lists) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Values:** The input sequences contain only the integers 0 and 3. The output sequences contain 0, 1, and 2.
3.  **Length Preservation:** The output sequence always has the same length as the corresponding input sequence.
4.  **Mapping 0:** The integer 0 in the input consistently maps to 0 in the output at the same position.
5.  **Mapping 3:** The integer 3 in the input maps to either 1 or 2 in the output. The specific mapping (3->1 or 3->2) seems to depend on context.
6.  **Contiguous Blocks:** The mapping of 3s appears related to contiguous blocks (runs) of 3s in the input.
7.  **Block Order Dependence:** Comparing examples, the *first* block of 3s encountered (reading left-to-right) maps differently than *subsequent* blocks of 3s.
8.  **Initial Element Influence:** The mapping rule for the first vs. subsequent blocks of 3s seems to depend on whether the entire input sequence starts with a 0 or a 3.
    *   If the input starts with 0: The first block of 3s maps to 2s, and subsequent blocks map to 1s. (See train\_1, train\_3, train\_5, train\_7)
    *   If the input starts with 3: The first block of 3s maps to 1s, and subsequent blocks map to 2s. (See train\_2, train\_4, train\_6)

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 3]
      - first_element: either 0 or 3
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: same as input_sequence
  - name: block_of_3s
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - composed_of: integer 3
      - location: within input_sequence
      - index: ordinal position (1st, 2nd, ...) among blocks of 3s

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_sequence element
    to: output_sequence element
    conditions:
      - if input element is 0, output element is 0.
      - if input element is 3:
          - mapping depends on whether the 3 belongs to the first block_of_3s or a subsequent block_of_3s.
          - the specific rule (first_block -> 1 or first_block -> 2) depends on the first_element of the input_sequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    actor: transformation_process
    input: input_sequence
    output: identified blocks_of_3s with their ordinal index
  - name: determine_mapping_rule
    actor: transformation_process
    input: first_element of input_sequence
    output: rule (e.g., first_block->2, subsequent->1 OR first_block->1, subsequent->2)
  - name: apply_mapping
    actor: transformation_process
    input: input_sequence, identified_blocks, mapping_rule
    output: output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Determine the mapping rule based on the first element of the input sequence:
    *   If the first element is 0, set `first_block_map_value = 2` and `subsequent_block_map_value = 1`.
    *   If the first element is 3, set `first_block_map_value = 1` and `subsequent_block_map_value = 2`.
3.  Initialize a counter `block_index` to 0.
4.  Initialize a variable `current_map_value` to store the value to map the current block of 3s to.
5.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from 0 to length-1.
6.  Get the current input element `input_val = input_sequence[i]`.
7.  If `input_val` is 0:
    *   Set the corresponding element in the output sequence `output_sequence[i] = 0`.
8.  If `input_val` is 3:
    *   Check if this is the start of a new block of 3s (either `i == 0` or the previous element `input_sequence[i-1]` was 0).
    *   If it is the start of a new block:
        *   Increment `block_index` by 1.
        *   If `block_index` is 1, set `current_map_value = first_block_map_value`.
        *   Else (if `block_index` > 1), set `current_map_value = subsequent_block_map_value`.
    *   Set the corresponding element in the output sequence `output_sequence[i] = current_map_value`.
9.  Return the completed output sequence.
