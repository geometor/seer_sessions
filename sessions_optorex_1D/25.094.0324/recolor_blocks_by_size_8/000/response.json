The output sequences contain 0, 1, and 2.\n3.  **Length Preservation:** The output sequence always has the same length as the corresponding input sequence.\n4.  **Mapping 0:** The integer 0 in the input consistently maps to 0 in the output at the same position.\n5.  **Mapping 3:** The integer 3 in the input maps to either 1 or 2 in the output. The specific mapping (3->1 or 3->2) seems to depend on context.\n6.  **Contiguous Blocks:** The mapping of 3s appears related to contiguous blocks (runs) of 3s in the input.\n7.  **Block Order Dependence:** Comparing examples, the *first* block of 3s encountered (reading left-to-right) maps differently than *subsequent* blocks of 3s.\n8.  **Initial Element Influence:** The mapping rule for the first vs. subsequent blocks of 3s seems to depend on whether the entire input sequence starts with a 0 or a 3.\n    *   If the input starts with 0: The first block of 3s maps to 2s, and subsequent blocks map to 1s. (See train\\_1, train\\_3, train\\_5, train\\_7)\n    *   If the input starts with 3: The first block of 3s maps to 1s, and subsequent blocks map to 2s. (See train\\_2, train\\_4, train\\_6)\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
