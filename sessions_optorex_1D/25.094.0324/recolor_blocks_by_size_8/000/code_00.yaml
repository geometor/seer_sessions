objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 3]
      - first_element: either 0 or 3
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - contains_values: [0, 1, 2]
      - length: same as input_sequence
  - name: block_of_3s
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - composed_of: integer 3
      - location: within input_sequence
      - index: ordinal position (1st, 2nd, ...) among blocks of 3s

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_sequence element
    to: output_sequence element
    conditions:
      - if input element is 0, output element is 0.
      - if input element is 3:
          - mapping depends on whether the 3 belongs to the first block_of_3s or a subsequent block_of_3s.
          - the specific rule (first_block -> 1 or first_block -> 2) depends on the first_element of the input_sequence.
