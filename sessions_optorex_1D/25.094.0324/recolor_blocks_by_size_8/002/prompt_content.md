"""
Transforms an input sequence of 0s and 3s into an output sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s based on the following rules:

1.  The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Each 0 in the input sequence maps to a 0 in the output sequence at the same position.
3.  Contiguous blocks (runs) of 3s in the input sequence are mapped to either 1s or 2s in the output sequence.
4.  The mapping rule depends on the first element of the input sequence:
    - If the input sequence starts with 0: The first block of 3s maps to 2s, and all subsequent blocks of 3s map to 1s.
    - If the input sequence starts with 3: The first block of 3s maps to 1s, and all subsequent blocks of 3s map to 2s.
