```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms an input 1D NumPy array of 0s and 3s into an output 1D NumPy array of 0s, 1s, and 2s based on the following rules:

1.  The output array has the same length as the input array.
2.  Each 0 in the input array maps to a 0 in the output array at the same position.
3.  Contiguous blocks (runs) of 3s in the input array are mapped to either 1s or 2s in the output array.
4.  The mapping rule depends on the first element of the input array:
    - If the input array starts with 0: The first block of 3s maps to 2s, and all subsequent blocks of 3s map to 1s.
    - If the input array starts with 3: The first block of 3s maps to 1s, and all subsequent blocks of 3s map to 2s.
