            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the feedback and refine the approach.\n\n**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" consistently occurred across all examples. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function, designed to accept a 1D NumPy array, was actually passed a multi-dimensional array (likely 2D) by the testing environment. The condition `if input_grid[0] == 0:` (and potentially others like it) fails because `input_grid[0]` returns the first *row* (an array) rather than the first *element* when `input_grid` is 2D.\n\nThe strategy is to adapt the understanding and the program to handle this potential multi-dimensional input. The core transformation logic, which depends on linear sequence processing (identifying contiguous blocks of '3's in reading order and mapping them based on the very first element and block order), appears correct based on the original input/output pairs. Therefore, the input grid should be treated as a flattened, 1D sequence for the purpose of applying the transformation rule.\n\n**Metrics and Observations**\n\n*   **Consistency:** The same ambiguity error occurred for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the error report.\n*   **Error Location:** The error points to conditional checks involving array elements (e.g., `input_grid[0] == 0`). This happens when comparing an array slice (like a row) to a scalar.\n*   **Implication:** The testing environment likely parses the input strings (e.g., \"0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 3 3 3\") into multi-dimensional NumPy arrays, even though the transformation logic operates linearly.\n*   **Core Logic Validity:** Despite the error, the underlying logic identified previously (mapping 0->0, mapping blocks of 3s to 1 or 2 based on the first element and block order) seems consistent with the string-based examples. The issue is the data structure mismatch.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
