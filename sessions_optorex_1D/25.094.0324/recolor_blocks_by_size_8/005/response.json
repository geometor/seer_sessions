Each 0 in the flattened sequence maps to a 0 in the output.\n2.  Contiguous blocks (runs) of 3s in the flattened sequence are mapped to either 1s or 2s.\n3.  The mapping rule for blocks of 3s depends on the very first element of the flattened sequence:\n    - If the first element is 0: The first block of 3s maps to 2s, and all subsequent blocks map to 1s.\n    - If the first element is 3: The first block of 3s maps to 1s, and all subsequent blocks map to 2s.\nThe final output grid has the same shape as the input grid.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input NumPy grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A NumPy array (potentially multi-dimensional) containing integers (0s and 3s).\n\n    Returns:\n        A NumPy array of the same shape containing the transformed sequence (0s, 1s, 2s).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Store the original shape of the input grid\n    original_shape = input_grid.shape\n    \n    # Flatten the input grid to process it as a 1D sequence\n    flattened_input = input_grid.flatten()\n    n = flattened_input.shape[0]\n\n    # Handle empty input\n    if n == 0:\n        # Return an empty array with the original shape (which might be (0,) or (0, 0), etc.)\n        return np.array([], dtype=int).reshape(original_shape)\n\n    # Initialize a flattened output array with zeros\n    flattened_output = np.zeros(n, dtype=int)\n\n    # Determine the mapping rule based on the very first element of the flattened input\n    first_block_map_value = 0\n    subsequent_block_map_value = 0\n    \n    # Check if the flattened array has at least one element before accessing index 0\n    if n > 0:\n        if flattened_input[0] == 0:\n            first_block_map_value = 2\n            subsequent_block_map_value = 1\n        elif flattened_input[0] == 3:\n            first_block_map_value = 1\n            subsequent_block_map_value = 2\n        # Assuming input only contains 0 or 3\n\n    # Initialize block tracking variables\n    block_count = 0\n    current_map_value = 0 # Stores the value to map the current block of 3s to\n\n    # Iterate through the flattened input sequence\n    for i in range(n):\n        input_val = flattened_input[i]\n\n        # Handle 0s: output is already 0, so just assign and continue\n        if input_val == 0:\n            flattened_output[i] = 0\n            continue # Skip the rest of the loop for 0s\n\n        # Handle 3s\n        elif input_val == 3:\n            # Check if this is the start of a new block of 3s in the flattened sequence\n            # A new block starts at index 0 if the value is 3,\n            # or if the current value is 3 and the previous was 0.\n            is_new_block_start = (i == 0) or (flattened_input[i-1] == 0)\n\n            if is_new_block_start:\n                # Increment block counter\n                block_count += 1\n                # Determine the mapping value for this new block\n                if block_count == 1:\n                    current_map_value = first_block_map_value\n                else:\n                    current_map_value = subsequent_block_map_value\n\n            # Set the output value using the mapping value for the current block\n            flattened_output[i] = current_map_value\n            \n        # Optional: Handle unexpected input values if necessary\n        # else:\n        #     pass # Or raise an error, or assign a default\n\n    # Reshape the flattened output array back to the original input grid shape\n    output_grid = flattened_output.reshape(original_shape)\n\n    return output_grid\n```"
