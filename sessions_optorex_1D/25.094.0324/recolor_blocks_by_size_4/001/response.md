"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 3s into a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
The transformation rules are:
1. 0s in the input remain 0s in the output at the same positions.
2. The input sequence contains exactly two contiguous blocks of 3s.
3. The longer block of 3s in the input is replaced by a block of 1s of the same length in the output.
4. The shorter block of 3s in the input is replaced by a block of 2s of the same length in the output.
