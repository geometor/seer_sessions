Input is expected to be a 1D list or NumPy array of integers (0s and 3s). It will be processed as a flat 1D list.\n2. 0s in the input remain 0s in the output at the same positions.\n3. The input sequence must contain exactly two contiguous blocks of 3s.\n4. The lengths of these two blocks are compared:\n    a. If the lengths differ, the longer block of 3s is replaced by 1s, and the shorter block by 2s.\n    b. If the lengths are equal, the block appearing earlier in the sequence (smaller start index) is replaced by 1s, and the block appearing later is replaced by 2s.\n5. The output is a list of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s) with the same length as the input.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_blocks(sequence, value):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all contiguous blocks of a specified value in a 1D sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: The input list (must be 1D).\n        value: The value to find blocks of.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a block\n        and contains 'start' (index), 'end' (index), and 'length'.\n        Returns an empty list if no blocks are found.\n    \"\"\"\n    blocks = []\n    in_block = False\n    start_index = -1\n    n = len(sequence)\n\n    for i, element in enumerate(sequence):\n        # Start of a new block\n        if element == value and not in_block:\n            in_block = True\n            start_index = i\n        # End of a block (current element is different)\n        elif element != value and in_block:\n            in_block = False\n            end_index = i - 1\n            length = end_index - start_index + 1\n            blocks.append({'start': start_index, 'end': end_index, 'length': length})\n        # Continue in block - no action needed here\n\n    # Handle a block that extends to the very end of the sequence\n    if in_block:\n        end_index = n - 1\n        length = end_index - start_index + 1\n        blocks.append({'start': start_index, 'end': end_index, 'length': length})\n\n    return blocks\n\ndef transform(input_data):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        input_data: A list or 1D numpy array of integers (0s and 3s).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s) representing the transformed sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a flat list\n    if isinstance(input_data, np.ndarray):\n        # Flatten if multi-dimensional, then convert to list\n        processed_sequence = input_data.flatten().tolist()\n    elif isinstance(input_data, list):\n         # Attempt to flatten if it's a list of lists (e.g., [[0, 0, 3,...]])\n        if input_data and isinstance(input_data[0], list):\n             processed_sequence = [item for sublist in input_data for item in sublist]\n        else:\n             processed_sequence = list(input_data) # Ensure it's a mutable copy\n    else:\n        # Handle other unexpected types if necessary\n        raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list or NumPy array.\")\n        \n    # Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the processed input\n    output_sequence = list(processed_sequence)\n\n    # Find all contiguous blocks of the digit 3\n    blocks_of_3s = find_blocks(processed_sequence, 3)\n\n    # Check if exactly two blocks were found, as expected from the problem description.\n    if len(blocks_of_3s) != 2:\n        # According to the observed pattern, there should be exactly two blocks.\n        # If not, return the sequence unmodified as the rule doesn't apply.\n        # Consider raising an error if this situation indicates invalid input per stricter rules.\n        print(f\"Warning: Expected 2 blocks of 3s, but found {len(blocks_of_3s)}.
