"""
Transforms a 1D sequence of 0s and 3s into a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s based on contiguous blocks of 3s.

The transformation rules are:
1. Input is expected to be a 1D list or NumPy array of integers (0s and 3s). It will be processed as a flat 1D list.
2. 0s in the input remain 0s in the output at the same positions.
3. The input sequence must contain exactly two contiguous blocks of 3s.
4. The lengths of these two blocks are compared:
    a. If the lengths differ, the longer block of 3s is replaced by 1s, and the shorter block by 2s.
    b. If the lengths are equal, the block appearing earlier in the sequence (smaller start index) is replaced by 1s, and the block appearing later is replaced by 2s.
5. The output is a list of integers (0s, 1s, and 2s) with the same length as the input.
