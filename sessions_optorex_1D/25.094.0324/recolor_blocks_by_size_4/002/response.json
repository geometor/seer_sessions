            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe analysis confirms that the core logic identified previously (finding two blocks of 3s, replacing the longer block with 1s and the shorter block with 2s) is correct and consistent across all provided training examples. The errors encountered during the initial code execution (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly suggest an issue related to the data type being passed to the function in the testing environment (likely a NumPy array instead of a standard Python list), rather than a flaw in the transformation logic itself.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the implementation slightly to ensure robustness against list-like inputs (like NumPy arrays) by explicitly converting the input to a standard Python list within the function. The fundamental natural language program describing the transformation remains valid.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution performed the following analysis on each training example:\n1.  **Input Parsing:** Successfully converted input strings to lists of integers.\n2.  **Block Identification:** Used the `find_blocks` function to locate contiguous blocks of the value `3`.\n    *   Example 1: Blocks at [2:7] (len 5), [8:11] (len 3)\n    *   Example 2: Blocks at [0:7] (len 7), [9:11] (len 2)\n    *   Example 3: Blocks at [4:6] (len 2), [9:12] (len 3)\n    *   Example 4: Blocks at [2:4] (len 2), [6:10] (len 4)\n    *   Example 5: Blocks at [3:5] (len 2), [9:12] (len 3)\n    *   Example 6: Blocks at [1:5] (len 4), [9:12] (len 3)\n    *   Example 7: Blocks at [1:3] (len 2), [5:11] (len 6)\n3.  **Length Comparison:** Compared the lengths of the two identified blocks in each example.\n    *   Example 1: 5 > 3\n    *   Example 2: 7 > 2\n    *   Example 3: 3 > 2\n    *   Example 4: 4 > 2\n    *   Example 5: 3 > 2\n    *   Example 6: 4 > 3\n    *   Example 7: 6 > 2\n4.  **Rule Application & Verification:** Simulated the transformation by replacing the longer block's elements with `1` and the shorter block's elements with `2` in a copy of the input. Confirmed that this reconstructed output matched the provided target output for all seven examples.\n5.  **Consistency Check:** All examples consistently followed the rule: find two blocks of 3s, identify the longer and shorter, replace with 1s and 2s respectively, keep 0s unchanged. All examples had exactly two blocks, and their lengths were always different.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
