task_type: sequence_transformation
input_elements:
  - type: integer
    values: [0, 3]
output_elements:
  - type: integer
    values: [0, 1, 2]
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
  - name: block_of_3s
    type: contiguous subsequence of the integer 3
    properties:
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - position: start and end indices in the main sequence
relationships:
  - type: identity
    description: Input 0 maps directly to output 0 at the same position.
  - type: transformation
    description: Input 3 maps to either output 1 or output 2.
  - type: grouping
    description: Input 3s are processed based on contiguous blocks.
  - type: comparison
    description: The lengths of the two blocks of 3s determine their output mapping.
rules:
  - description: There are exactly two blocks of 3s in the input sequence.
  - description: The longer block of 3s is transformed into a block of 1s of the same length.
  - description: The shorter block of 3s is transformed into a block of 2s of the same length.
assumptions:
  - The input sequence always contains exactly two distinct blocks of consecutive 3s.
  - The two blocks of 3s will always have different lengths (no tie-breaking needed based on examples).
