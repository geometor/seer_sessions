In all examples, there are exactly two distinct blocks of consecutive 3s separated by one or more 0s.\n6.  **Length Dependence:** Comparing the blocks of 3s within each input, one block is consistently transformed into 1s, and the other into 2s. Observing the lengths of these blocks reveals a pattern: the *longer* block of 3s is always transformed into 1s, and the *shorter* block of 3s is always transformed into 2s.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
