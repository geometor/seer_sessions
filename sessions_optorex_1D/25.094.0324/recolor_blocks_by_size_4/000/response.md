Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Data Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Values:** The digits observed are 0 and 3 in the input, and 0, 1, and 2 in the output.
3.  **Conservation:** The digit 0 appears to be conserved; its position and value remain unchanged from input to output in all examples.
4.  **Transformation:** The digit 3 in the input is transformed into either 1 or 2 in the output.
5.  **Grouping:** The transformation of 3s seems related to contiguous blocks or sequences of 3s. In all examples, there are exactly two distinct blocks of consecutive 3s separated by one or more 0s.
6.  **Length Dependence:** Comparing the blocks of 3s within each input, one block is consistently transformed into 1s, and the other into 2s. Observing the lengths of these blocks reveals a pattern: the *longer* block of 3s is always transformed into 1s, and the *shorter* block of 3s is always transformed into 2s.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_elements:
  - type: integer
    values: [0, 3]
output_elements:
  - type: integer
    values: [0, 1, 2]
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
  - name: block_of_3s
    type: contiguous subsequence of the integer 3
    properties:
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - position: start and end indices in the main sequence
relationships:
  - type: identity
    description: Input 0 maps directly to output 0 at the same position.
  - type: transformation
    description: Input 3 maps to either output 1 or output 2.
  - type: grouping
    description: Input 3s are processed based on contiguous blocks.
  - type: comparison
    description: The lengths of the two blocks of 3s determine their output mapping.
rules:
  - description: There are exactly two blocks of 3s in the input sequence.
  - description: The longer block of 3s is transformed into a block of 1s of the same length.
  - description: The shorter block of 3s is transformed into a block of 2s of the same length.
assumptions:
  - The input sequence always contains exactly two distinct blocks of consecutive 3s.
  - The two blocks of 3s will always have different lengths (no tie-breaking needed based on examples).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Identify all contiguous blocks of the digit 3 in the input sequence. Record their starting positions, ending positions, and lengths.
3.  Find the two blocks of 3s identified in the previous step. (Based on the examples, assume there will always be exactly two).
4.  Compare the lengths of these two blocks.
5.  Identify the block with the greater length and the block with the lesser length.
6.  Iterate through the input sequence index by index:
    a.  If the digit at the current index is 0, place a 0 in the corresponding position in the output sequence.
    b.  If the digit at the current index is 3 and belongs to the *longer* block of 3s, place a 1 in the corresponding position in the output sequence.
    c.  If the digit at the current index is 3 and belongs to the *shorter* block of 3s, place a 2 in the corresponding position in the output sequence.
7.  Return the completed output sequence.
