            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe execution results show a consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` across all examples. This strongly indicates that the input provided to the `transform` function during testing is likely a NumPy array, and a boolean comparison within the code (specifically `element == value` or `element != value` in the `find_blocks` function) is being performed on an array-like object where a single boolean is expected. This happens if the iteration variable `element` is itself an array (e.g., if the input was unexpectedly multi-dimensional) or if the comparison logic implicitly creates a boolean array.\n\nGiven the problem description and input/output formats, the most probable cause is that the input sequence, while representing 1D data, is passed as a NumPy array, and the iteration or comparison logic is faulting. The previous code attempted to mitigate this by converting the input to a list (`processed_sequence = list(input_sequence)`), but the error might still occur if the `find_blocks` function doesn't operate on this converted list or if the input is nested (e.g., `[[0, 0, 3,...]]`).\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Input Handling:** Ensure the code explicitly handles potential NumPy array inputs and operates on a flattened, 1D list structure. This might involve checking the input type/shape or simply reinforcing the conversion to a standard Python list *before* iterating for block finding.\n2.  **Refine `find_blocks`:** Ensure the `find_blocks` function iterates over a standard list or correctly handles element-wise comparison for NumPy arrays if direct conversion isn't sufficient (though conversion is safer).\n3.  **Tie-breaking:** Explicitly define the tie-breaking rule for blocks of equal length, which was noted as an ambiguity previously. A reasonable rule is to use positional order (first block becomes 1s, second becomes 2s).\n4.  **NL Program Update:** Refine the natural language program to include input type clarification and the explicit tie-breaking rule.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe primary metric from the failed execution is the consistent `ValueError` across all test cases. This points to a systematic type-handling issue rather than a logic flaw specific to certain inputs. The core logic of identifying two blocks of 3s, comparing lengths, and mapping the longer to 1s and shorter to 2s appears sound based on manual inspection of the examples provided initially. The key is ensuring the implementation correctly processes the input data type.\n\nLet's re-confirm block details for one example (train_4):\nInput: `[0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]`\n*   Block 1: `start=2`, `end=3`, `length=2`\n*   Block 2: `start=6`, `end=9`, `length=4`\n*   Comparison: Block 2 (length 4) > Block 1 (length 2)\n*   `longer_block` = Block 2 (indices 6-9) -> maps to 1s\n*   `shorter_block` = Block 1 (indices 2-3) -> maps to 2s\n*   Expected Output: `[0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]` (Matches train_4 output)\n\nThe logic holds. The implementation needs fixing for type handling.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
