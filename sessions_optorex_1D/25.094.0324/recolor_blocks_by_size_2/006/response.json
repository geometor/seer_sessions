            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided results indicate that the `transform` function, as executed by the testing harness, consistently failed to modify the input sequence, returning the original input as the output for all examples. However, a manual trace of the provided Python code (`code_00.py`) against the examples suggests that the implemented logic *should* produce the correct outputs based on the initial analysis (identifying two blocks of '3's and swapping their transformation to '1's or '2's based on the length of the first block).\n\nThis discrepancy strongly suggests an issue external to the core logic, likely related to:\n1.  **Execution Environment**: The testing harness might not be executing the provided `transform` function correctly.\n2.  **Input/Output Mismatch**: The harness might be expecting a different function signature or data type (e.g., string processing instead of numpy arrays, despite the function signature) than what was provided.\n3.  **Code Version Mismatch**: The code reported as `code_00.py` in the prompt might not be the exact code run by the harness that produced the failed results.\n\n**Strategy:**\nAssuming the Python code (`code_00.py`) correctly represents the intended transformation logic derived from the examples, the strategy is to:\n1.  Verify the logic's correctness against the examples using code execution.\n2.  Refine the documentation (YAML, Natural Language Program) based on this verified logic.\n3.  Proceed with the assumption that the transformation rule identified (based on the two blocks of '3's and the length of the first block) is correct, and the execution failure was an anomaly of the testing process.\n\n## Metrics Analysis\n\nWe will use code execution to re-evaluate the examples based on the intended logic within the provided `transform` function.\n\n"

Let's reconsider the examples where the first block length is > 2:\n\n*   `train_5`: Input `0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3`, Output `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 2`. Block lengths: 5, 2. First length > 2. Output: 1s then 2s. (Matches rule)\n*   `train_6`: Input `0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3`, Output `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2`. Block lengths: 5, 3. First length > 2. Output: 1s then 2s. (Matches rule)\n*   `test_1`: Input `3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0`, Output `2 2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0`. Block lengths: 3, 4. First length > 2. Output: 2s then 1s. (Contradicts rule)\n\nIt seems the rule needs modification. The difference in `test_1` is that the *second* block is longer than the *first* block (length 4 vs 3). In `train_5` and `train_6`, the first block was longer than the second.\n\n**New Hypothesis:** Compare the lengths of the two blocks.\n*   If `length(Block1) > length(Block2)`: First block -> 1s, Second block -> 2s.\n*   If `length(Block1) <= length(Block2)`: First block -> 2s, Second block -> 1s.\n\nLet's test this new hypothesis:\n*   `train_1`: Lengths (2, 4). 2 <= 4. Rule: 1->2, 2->1. Output: `0 2 2 ... 1 1 1 1`. Matches.\n*   `train_2`: Lengths (2, 6). 2 <= 6. Rule: 1->2, 2->1. Output: `2 2 ... 1 1 1 1 1 1`. Matches.\n*   `train_3`: Lengths (2, 8). 2 <= 8. Rule: 1->2, 2->1. Output: `2 2 ... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`. Matches.\n*   `train_4`: Lengths (2, 5). 2 <= 5. Rule: 1->2, 2->1. Output: `0 2 2 ... 1 1 1 1 1`. Matches.\n*   `train_5`: Lengths (5, 2). 5 > 2. Rule: 1->1, 2->2. Output: `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 ... 2 2`. Matches.\n*   `train_6`: Lengths (5, 3). 5 > 3. Rule: 1->1, 2->2. Output: `0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 ... 2 2 2`. Matches.\n*   `train_7`: Lengths (2, 5). 2 <= 5. Rule: 1->2, 2->1. Output: `0 0 0 2 2 ... 1 1 1 1 1`. Matches.\n*   `test_1`: Lengths (3, 4). 3 <= 4. Rule: 1->2, 2->1. Output: `2 2 2 ... 1 1 1 1`. Matches.\n\nThis revised hypothesis successfully explains all training examples and the previously problematic test example.\n\n## Updated YAML Facts\n\n"
