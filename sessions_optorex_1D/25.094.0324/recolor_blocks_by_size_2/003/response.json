Identifies all contiguous blocks (runs) of the integer '3' in the input sequence.\n2.  Assumes exactly two such blocks exist based on observed examples.\n3.  Checks the length of the first block encountered.\n4.  If the first block's length is greater than 2:\n    - Integers in the first block are replaced with '1'.\n    - Integers in the second block are replaced with '2'.\n5.  Otherwise (if the first block's length is 2 or less):\n    - Integers in the first block are replaced with '2'.\n    - Integers in the second block are replaced with '1'.\n6.
