Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format**: Both input and output are sequences of single digits (specifically 0 and 3 in the input, and 0, 1, and 2 in the output) separated by spaces. The length of the sequence is preserved (12 digits in all examples).
2.  **Key Elements**: The digits `0` and `3` are the primary components of the input. The digit `0` appears to remain unchanged in the output. The digit `3` is transformed into either `1` or `2`.
3.  **Pattern**: The transformation of `3`s seems related to contiguous blocks or runs of `3`s. In all examples, there are exactly two distinct blocks of consecutive `3`s.
4.  **Transformation Logic**:
    *   Digits `0` are mapped directly to `0` in the output.
    *   Digits `3` are mapped to either `1` or `2`.
    *   The mapping (`3`->`1` or `3`->`2`) depends on which block of `3`s the digit belongs to (the first block or the second block encountered sequentially) and a condition related to the first block.
5.  **Condition Discovery**: By comparing examples where the first block of `3`s becomes `2`s (train 1, 2, 3, 4, 7) versus examples where it becomes `1`s (train 5, 6), the distinguishing factor appears to be the *length* of the first block of `3`s.
    *   If the first block of `3`s has a length of 2 (or potentially less, although only length 2 is seen), it transforms into `2`s, and the second block transforms into `1`s.
    *   If the first block of `3`s has a length greater than 2 (length 5 in examples 5 and 6), it transforms into `1`s, and the second block transforms into `2`s.

    description: How input digits correspond to output digits.
    details:
      - Input '0' maps to Output '0'.

  - type: conditional_logic
    description: The rule determining whether the first block of '3's becomes '1's or '2's.
    details: Based on the length of the first block of '3's. If length > 2, pattern is '1 then 2'. Otherwise, pattern is '2 then 1'.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify all contiguous blocks (runs) consisting solely of the digit `3`. Record their start and end positions. Note the order in which these blocks appear. (Assume there will always be exactly two such blocks based on the examples).
3.  Let `Block1` be the first block of `3`s found and `Block2` be the second block of `3`s found.
4.  Calculate the length of `Block1`.
5.  Create a new sequence, initially a copy of the input sequence.
6.  If the length of `Block1` is greater than 2:
    *   Replace all digits corresponding to `Block1` in the new sequence with `1`.
    *   Replace all digits corresponding to `Block2` in the new sequence with `2`.
7.  Else (if the length of `Block1` is 2 or less):
    *   Replace all digits corresponding to `Block1` in the new sequence with `2`.
    *   Replace all digits corresponding to `Block2` in the new sequence with `1`.
8.  Ensure all digits that were originally `0` remain `0` in the new sequence.
9.  Format the new sequence as a space-separated string for the output.
```python
import re

"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on contiguous blocks of '3's.

1.  Parses the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Identifies all contiguous blocks (runs) of the digit '3' in the input list.
3.  Assumes exactly two blocks of '3's exist based on the provided examples.
4.  Checks the length of the first block of '3's.
5.  Creates an output list, initially copying the input list.
6.  If the first block's length is greater than 2:
    - Replaces digits in the first block's positions with '1'.
    - Replaces digits in the second block's positions with '2'.
7.  Otherwise (if the first block's length is 2 or less):
    - Replaces digits in the first block's positions with '2'.
    - Replaces digits in the second block's positions with '1'.
8.  Digits originally '0' remain '0'.
9.  Formats the transformed list back into a space-separated string.
