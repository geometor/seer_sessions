            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe primary issue identified by the execution results is an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, based on the initial presentation of the examples. However, the execution environment passed the input as a NumPy array, causing the `input_str.split()` method call to fail.\n\nThe underlying transformation logic identified in the dreamer phase (identifying two contiguous blocks of '3's and swapping their replacement values between '1' and '2' based on the length of the first block) appears consistent with the input/output pairs when viewed as sequences of integers.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the approach to directly handle the input as a sequence (list or array) of integers, removing the string parsing step. The core block identification and conditional replacement logic should be retained but applied directly to the integer sequence.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nBased on the analysis of the training examples, treating inputs and outputs as lists/arrays of integers:\n\n| Example | Input Array                             | Output Array                            | Block 1 (idx, len) | Block 2 (idx, len) | First Block Len > 2? | Expected Transformation | Actual Output Matches? |\n| :------ | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3]`             | `[0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]`             | (1-2, 2)           | (8-11, 4)          | False                | Block1->2, Block2->1  | Yes                  |\n| train_2 | `[3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0]`             | `[2,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0]`             | (0-1, 2)           | (4-9, 6)           | False                | Block1->2, Block2->1  | Yes                  |\n| train_3 | `[3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0]`             | `[2,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]`             | (0-1, 2)           | (3-10, 8)          | False                | Block1->2, Block2->1  | Yes                  |\n| train_4 | `[0,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3]`             | `[0,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]`             | (1-2, 2)           | (7-11, 5)          | False                | Block1->2, Block2->1  | Yes                  |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3]`             | `[0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,2,2]`             | (3-7, 5)           | (10-11, 2)         | True                 | Block1->1, Block2->2  | Yes                  |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3]`             | `[0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,2,2,2]`             | (3-7, 5)           | (9-11, 3)          | True                 | Block1->1, Block2->2  | Yes                  |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3]`             | `[0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]`             | (3-4, 2)           | (7-11, 5)          | False                | Block1->2, Block2->1  | Yes                  |\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   Input/Output are consistently 1D sequences of 12 integers.\n*   Inputs contain only 0s and 3s. Outputs contain 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n*   All examples contain exactly two distinct blocks of consecutive 3s.\n*   The transformation rule based on the length of the first block (threshold > 2) correctly predicts the output for all training examples.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
