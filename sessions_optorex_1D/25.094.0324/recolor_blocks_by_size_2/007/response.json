Identifies the two contiguous blocks (runs) of the integer '3' in the input sequence. It assumes exactly two such blocks exist.\n2.  Compares the lengths of the first block (Block1) and the second block (Block2).\n3.  If the length of Block1 is strictly greater than the length of Block2:\n    - Integers in Block1 are replaced with '1'.\n    - Integers in Block2 are replaced with '2'.\n4.  Otherwise (if the length of Block1 is less than or equal to the length of Block2):\n    - Integers in Block1 are replaced with '2'.\n    - Integers in Block2 are replaced with '1'.\n5.
