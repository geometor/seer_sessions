Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format**: Both input and output are sequences of single digits (specifically 0 and 3 in the input, and 0, 1, and 2 in the output) separated by spaces. The length of the sequence is preserved (12 digits in all examples).
2.  **Key Elements**: The digits `0` and `3` are the primary components of the input. The digit `0` appears to remain unchanged in the output. The digit `3` is transformed into either `1` or `2`.
3.  **Pattern**: The transformation of `3`s seems related to contiguous blocks or runs of `3`s. In all examples, there are exactly two distinct blocks of consecutive `3`s.
4.  **Transformation Logic**:
    *   Digits `0` are mapped directly to `0` in the output.
    *   Digits `3` are mapped to either `1` or `2`.
    *   The mapping (`3`->`1` or `3`->`2`) depends on which block of `3`s the digit belongs to (the first block or the second block encountered sequentially) and a condition related to the first block.
5.  **Condition Discovery**: By comparing examples where the first block of `3`s becomes `2`s (train 1, 2, 3, 4, 7) versus examples where it becomes `1`s (train 5, 6), the distinguishing factor appears to be the *length* of the first block of `3`s.
    *   If the first block of `3`s has a length of 2 (or potentially less, although only length 2 is seen), it transforms into `2`s, and the second block transforms into `1`s.
    *   If the first block of `3`s has a length greater than 2 (length 5 in examples 5 and 6), it transforms into `1`s, and the second block transforms into `2`s.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A space-separated string of digits representing the input or output.
    properties:
      - length: The number of digits in the sequence (consistently 12).
      - values: The digits contained within (0, 1, 2, 3).
  - object: digit
    description: An individual number within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The integer value (0, 1, 2, or 3).
      - position: The index within the sequence.
  - object: block
    description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits (specifically '3' in the input).
    properties:
      - value: The digit composing the block (always 3 in input).
      - start_index: The position of the first digit in the block.
      - end_index: The position of the last digit in the block.
      - length: The number of digits in the block.
    relationships:
      - order: Blocks appear sequentially within the main sequence. We can identify the 'first' block, 'second' block, etc.
actions:
  - action: identify_blocks
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of the digit '3'.
    inputs:
      - input sequence
    outputs:
      - list of blocks (each with start_index, end_index, length).
  - action: determine_transformation_pattern
    description: Check the length of the first identified block of '3's to decide the replacement values.
    inputs:
      - first block of '3's
    outputs:
      - pattern_type: ('2 then 1' or '1 then 2')
  - action: apply_transformation
    description: Create the output sequence by applying the determined pattern to the blocks of '3's and keeping '0's unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input sequence
      - identified blocks
      - pattern_type
    outputs:
      - output sequence
relationships:
  - type: mapping
    description: How input digits correspond to output digits.
    details:
      - Input '0' maps to Output '0'.
      - Input '3' maps to Output '1' or '2' based on block properties and order.
  - type: conditional_logic
    description: The rule determining whether the first block of '3's becomes '1's or '2's.
    details: Based on the length of the first block of '3's. If length > 2, pattern is '1 then 2'. Otherwise, pattern is '2 then 1'.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify all contiguous blocks (runs) consisting solely of the digit `3`. Record their start and end positions. Note the order in which these blocks appear. (Assume there will always be exactly two such blocks based on the examples).
3.  Let `Block1` be the first block of `3`s found and `Block2` be the second block of `3`s found.
4.  Calculate the length of `Block1`.
5.  Create a new sequence, initially a copy of the input sequence.
6.  If the length of `Block1` is greater than 2:
    *   Replace all digits corresponding to `Block1` in the new sequence with `1`.
    *   Replace all digits corresponding to `Block2` in the new sequence with `2`.
7.  Else (if the length of `Block1` is 2 or less):
    *   Replace all digits corresponding to `Block1` in the new sequence with `2`.
    *   Replace all digits corresponding to `Block2` in the new sequence with `1`.
8.  Ensure all digits that were originally `0` remain `0` in the new sequence.
9.  Format the new sequence as a space-separated string for the output.
