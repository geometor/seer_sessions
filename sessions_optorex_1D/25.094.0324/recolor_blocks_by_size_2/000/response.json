            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format**: Both input and output are sequences of single digits (specifically 0 and 3 in the input, and 0, 1, and 2 in the output) separated by spaces. The length of the sequence is preserved (12 digits in all examples).\n2.  **Key Elements**: The digits `0` and `3` are the primary components of the input. The digit `0` appears to remain unchanged in the output. The digit `3` is transformed into either `1` or `2`.\n3.  **Pattern**: The transformation of `3`s seems related to contiguous blocks or runs of `3`s. In all examples, there are exactly two distinct blocks of consecutive `3`s.\n4.  **Transformation Logic**:\n    *   Digits `0` are mapped directly to `0` in the output.\n    *   Digits `3` are mapped to either `1` or `2`.\n    *   The mapping (`3`->`1` or `3`->`2`) depends on which block of `3`s the digit belongs to (the first block or the second block encountered sequentially) and a condition related to the first block.\n5.  **Condition Discovery**: By comparing examples where the first block of `3`s becomes `2`s (train 1, 2, 3, 4, 7) versus examples where it becomes `1`s (train 5, 6), the distinguishing factor appears to be the *length* of the first block of `3`s.\n    *   If the first block of `3`s has a length of 2 (or potentially less, although only length 2 is seen), it transforms into `2`s, and the second block transforms into `1`s.\n    *   If the first block of `3`s has a length greater than 2 (length 5 in examples 5 and 6), it transforms into `1`s, and the second block transforms into `2`s.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
