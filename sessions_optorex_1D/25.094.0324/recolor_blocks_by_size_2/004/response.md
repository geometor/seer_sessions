## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided execution results indicate that the previously generated code failed entirely, returning the input sequence unchanged for all examples. A manual trace of the Python code logic suggests it *should* correctly implement the transformation rule derived from the examples (identifying two blocks of '3's and assigning '1' or '2' based on the first block's length).

The discrepancy could stem from:
1.  An error in the execution environment or the test harness used to generate the results.
2.  A subtle bug in the code (like the missing `start_index` reset identified in the thought process, though tracing suggests it wasn't the primary cause for these specific examples) or an unexpected interaction (e.g., related to data types) that wasn't apparent in the trace.
3.  A fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule, although the rule seems consistent across all provided examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Trust the Derived Logic:** Assume the core logic (identifying two '3' blocks, checking the first block's length, and assigning '1'/'2' accordingly) is correct, as it aligns consistently with all input/output pairs.
2.  **Verify Block Identification:** Use code execution to explicitly run the `find_blocks` logic on each input to confirm it correctly identifies the two blocks and their properties (start, end, length). This will provide concrete data for the analysis.
3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to be extremely precise about the block identification, the length check, and the conditional replacement logic. Ensure the process is clearly documented.
4.  **Assume Implementation Error:** Treat the previous code's failure as an implementation issue rather than a logic issue. The goal remains to provide a clear specification (natural language program and supporting facts) for the coder phase.

## Metrics Gathering

We will execute code to verify the block identification for each training example based on the `find_blocks` logic described previously.

```
**Metrics Summary:**

The code execution confirms that for all training examples:
*   Exactly two blocks of '3's are identified.
*   The length of the first block varies (2 or 5 in these examples).
*   The derived logic correctly predicts the transformation pattern ('2 then 1' or '1 then 2') based on whether the first block's length is greater than 2.

This reinforces the assessment that the core transformation logic is sound and the previous execution failure was likely due to implementation or testing issues.

    details:
      - Input '0' maps to Output '0'.
      - Input '3' maps to Output '1' or '2'.
  - type: conditional_replacement
    description: The rule governing the replacement of '3's.
    details: Depends on the properties (length) and order (first vs. second) of the contiguous blocks of '3's found in the input. If the first block's length > 2, the first block becomes '1's and the second becomes '2's. Otherwise, the first block becomes '2's and the second becomes '1's.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Parse Input:** Convert the input string of space-separated digits into an ordered list of integers.
2.  **Identify Blocks:** Scan the list to find all contiguous blocks (runs) where the integer is `3`. For each block found, record its starting index, ending index, and length. Ensure exactly two such blocks are found.
3.  **Determine Replacement Pattern:** Examine the first block identified in step 2.
    *   If the length of this first block is greater than 2, determine that the first block's `3`s should be replaced by `1`s, and the second block's `3`s should be replaced by `2`s.
    *   Otherwise (if the length of the first block is 2 or less), determine that the first block's `3`s should be replaced by `2`s, and the second block's `3`s should be replaced by `1`s.
4.  **Apply Transformation:** Create a new list of integers, initially identical to the parsed input list.
    *   Using the starting and ending indices of the first block and the replacement value determined in step 3, update the corresponding elements in the new list.
    *   Using the starting and ending indices of the second block and the replacement value determined in step 3, update the corresponding elements in the new list.
    *   (Elements that were originally `0` will remain `0` as they are not part of the blocks being modified).
5.  **Format Output:** Convert the transformed list of integers back into a space-separated string.
