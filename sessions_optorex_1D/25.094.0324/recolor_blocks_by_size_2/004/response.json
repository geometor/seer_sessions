            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided execution results indicate that the previously generated code failed entirely, returning the input sequence unchanged for all examples. A manual trace of the Python code logic suggests it *should* correctly implement the transformation rule derived from the examples (identifying two blocks of '3's and assigning '1' or '2' based on the first block's length).\n\nThe discrepancy could stem from:\n1.  An error in the execution environment or the test harness used to generate the results.\n2.  A subtle bug in the code (like the missing `start_index` reset identified in the thought process, though tracing suggests it wasn't the primary cause for these specific examples) or an unexpected interaction (e.g., related to data types) that wasn't apparent in the trace.\n3.  A fundamental misunderstanding of the transformation rule, although the rule seems consistent across all provided examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Trust the Derived Logic:** Assume the core logic (identifying two '3' blocks, checking the first block's length, and assigning '1'/'2' accordingly) is correct, as it aligns consistently with all input/output pairs.\n2.  **Verify Block Identification:** Use code execution to explicitly run the `find_blocks` logic on each input to confirm it correctly identifies the two blocks and their properties (start, end, length). This will provide concrete data for the analysis.\n3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to be extremely precise about the block identification, the length check, and the conditional replacement logic. Ensure the process is clearly documented.\n4.  **Assume Implementation Error:** Treat the previous code's failure as an implementation issue rather than a logic issue. The goal remains to provide a clear specification (natural language program and supporting facts) for the coder phase.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nWe will execute code to verify the block identification for each training example based on the `find_blocks` logic described previously.\n\n"
