            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The initial code was designed to process a space-separated string, while the execution environment provides the input as a NumPy array. This caused the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` in all test cases.\n\nThe underlying transformation logic (identifying blocks of '3's separated by '0's and mapping the first block to '1's and the second to '2's) appears correct based on the initial examples and was not invalidated by the errors, as the code failed before executing this logic.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the input handling to accept a NumPy array directly.\n2.  Adjust the output format to return a NumPy array or a list of integers, aligning with the likely expectation of the testing framework, rather than a formatted string.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to accurately reflect the use of NumPy arrays or lists for input and output.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all examples, as indicated by the error messages.\n*   **Output Type (Expected):** Inferred to be `numpy.ndarray` or a list of integers, matching the input structure.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Preserved between input and output in all examples.\n*   **Value Mapping:**\n    *   `0` in input maps to `0` in output.\n    *   `3` in input maps to `1` or `2`.\n*   **Block Transformation Pattern:**\n    *   Example 1: First block `3 3 3 3 3` -> `1 1 1 1 1`, Second block `3 3 3 3` -> `2 2 2 2`.\n    *   Example 2: First block `3 3 3` -> `2 2 2`, Second block `3 3 3 3 3` -> `1 1 1 1 1`. ***Correction Needed:*** My initial analysis stated the *first* encountered block becomes 1s. Example 2 contradicts this slightly. Let's re-examine.\n        *   Train 1: `3 3 3 3 3` (1st) -> `1 1 1 1 1`; `3 3 3 3` (2nd) -> `2 2 2 2`\n        *   Train 2: `3 3 3` (1st) -> `2 2 2`; `3 3 3 3 3` (2nd) -> `1 1 1 1 1`\n        *   Train 3: `3 3` (1st) -> `2 2`; `3 3 3 3 3` (2nd) -> `1 1 1 1 1`\n        *   Train 4: `3 3 3 3` (1st) -> `1 1 1 1`; `3 3` (2nd) -> `2 2`\n        *   Train 5: `3 3` (1st) -> `2 2`; `3 3 3` (2nd) -> `1 1 1`\n        *   Train 6: `3 3` (1st) -> `2 2`; `3 3 3` (2nd) -> `1 1 1`\n        *   Train 7: `3 3 3 3 3` (1st) -> `1 1 1 1 1`; `3 3 3` (2nd) -> `2 2 2`\n\n    *   **Revised Observation:** The assignment to `1` or `2` doesn't strictly depend on the *order* of appearance (1st vs 2nd). It seems to alternate. Let's refine the hypothesis: The transformation assigns `1` and `2` to the blocks of `3`s, but the *which block gets which number* rule needs clarification. Looking again:\n        *   Train 1: 1st block (5 items) -> 1s; 2nd block (4 items) -> 2s\n        *   Train 2: 1st block (3 items) -> 2s; 2nd block (5 items) -> 1s\n        *   Train 3: 1st block (2 items) -> 2s; 2nd block (5 items) -> 1s\n        *   Train 4: 1st block (4 items) -> 1s; 2nd block (2 items) -> 2s\n        *   Train 5: 1st block (2 items) -> 2s; 2nd block (3 items) -> 1s\n        *   Train 6: 1st block (2 items) -> 2s; 2nd block (3 items) -> 1s\n        *   Train 7: 1st block (5 items) -> 1s; 2nd block (3 items) -> 2s\n\n    *   **Hypothesis 2 (Alternating Assignment):** Could it be that the *first* block gets assigned `1`, the *second* gets `2`, regardless of other properties? No, Train 2, 3, 5, 6 contradict this.\n    *   **Hypothesis 3 (Length-Based Assignment?):** Does the longer block get `1` and the shorter get `2`?\n        *   Train 1: Longer (5) -> 1s; Shorter (4) -> 2s (Consistent)\n        *   Train 2: Longer (5) -> 1s; Shorter (3) -> 2s (Consistent)\n        *   Train 3: Longer (5) -> 1s; Shorter (2) -> 2s (Consistent)\n        *   Train 4: Longer (4) -> 1s; Shorter (2) -> 2s (Consistent)\n        *   Train 5: Longer (3) -> 1s; Shorter (2) -> 2s (Consistent)\n        *   Train 6: Longer (3) -> 1s; Shorter (2) -> 2s (Consistent)\n        *   Train 7: Longer (5) -> 1s; Shorter (3) -> 2s (Consistent)\n        *   **Conclusion:** It appears the block with the *greater* number of 3s is transformed into 1s, and the block with the *fewer* number of 3s is transformed into 2s. This requires a two-pass approach: first identify the blocks and their lengths, then perform the transformation.\n\n**Revised YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
