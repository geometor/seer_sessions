task_elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - type: list or array of integers
      - elements: 0, 3 (input); 0, 1, 2 (output)
      - length: preserved between input and output

  - object: number_0
    properties:
      - value: 0
      - role: separator, identity element
    action:
      - maps directly to 0 in the output at the same position.

  - object: number_3
    properties:
      - value: 3
      - role: element to be transformed
    action:
      - transformed based on block context and order.

  - object: block_of_3s
    description: A contiguous subsequence containing only the number 3.
    properties:
      - composed_of: number_3
      - separator: number_0
      - order_of_appearance: ordinal position (1st, 2nd, etc.) when scanning left-to-right.
    relationships:
      - blocks are distinct segments within the main sequence.
      - transformation depends on the block's order_of_appearance.
    action:
      - if order_of_appearance is 1, transform all 3s in the block to 1s.
      - if order_of_appearance is 2, transform all 3s in the block to 2s.

  - object: transformation_rule
    description: The overall process mapping input sequence to output sequence.
    properties:
      - preserves sequence length.
      - maps 0 to 0.
      - identifies contiguous blocks of 3s separated by 0s.
      - maps the first block of 3s to 1s.
      - maps the second block of 3s to 2s.
