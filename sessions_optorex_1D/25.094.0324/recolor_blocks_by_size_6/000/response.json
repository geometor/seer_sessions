These blocks are separated by `0`s.\n5.  **Order Dependence:** The mapping of a block of `3`s (to `1`s or `2`s) is determined by the order in which that block appears when scanning the input sequence from left to right.\n    *   The first encountered contiguous block of `3`s is transformed into a block of `1`s of the same length.\n    *   The second encountered contiguous block of `3`s is transformed into a block of `2`s of the same length.\n6.  **Scope:** All provided examples contain exactly two blocks of `3`s, consistently following the first-block-to-1s, second-block-to-2s pattern.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
