**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single-digit integers represented as space-separated strings.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence in all examples.
3.  **Value Mapping:**
    *   The integer `0` in the input always maps to `0` in the output at the corresponding position.
    *   The integer `3` in the input maps to either `1` or `2` in the output.
4.  **Block Transformation:** The transformation of `3` depends on its position within contiguous blocks of `3`s. These blocks are separated by `0`s.
5.  **Order Dependence:** The mapping of a block of `3`s (to `1`s or `2`s) is determined by the order in which that block appears when scanning the input sequence from left to right.
    *   The first encountered contiguous block of `3`s is transformed into a block of `1`s of the same length.
    *   The second encountered contiguous block of `3`s is transformed into a block of `2`s of the same length.
6.  **Scope:** All provided examples contain exactly two blocks of `3`s, consistently following the first-block-to-1s, second-block-to-2s pattern.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence and a counter for blocks of `3`s encountered (set to 0).
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right.
3.  If the current element is `0`, append `0` to the output sequence.
4.  If the current element is `3`:
    a.  Check if this `3` starts a new block (i.e., it's the first `3` encountered, or the previous element was `0`).
    b.  If it starts a new block, increment the block counter.
    c.  Determine the target value based on the block counter: if the counter is 1, the target value is `1`; if the counter is 2, the target value is `2`.
    d.  Append the target value to the output sequence.
5.  Continue iterating until the end of the input sequence is reached.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.

Test Set Results:

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The initial code was designed to process a space-separated string, while the execution environment provides the input as a NumPy array. This caused the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` in all test cases.

The underlying transformation logic (identifying blocks of '3's separated by '0's and mapping the first block to '1's and the second to '2's) appears correct based on the initial examples and was not invalidated by the errors, as the code failed before executing this logic.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the input handling to accept a NumPy array directly.
2.  Adjust the output format to return a NumPy array or a list of integers, aligning with the likely expectation of the testing framework, rather than a formatted string.
3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) to accurately reflect the use of NumPy arrays or lists for input and output.

**Metrics and Observations:**

*   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all examples, as indicated by the error messages.
*   **Output Type (Expected):** Inferred to be `numpy.ndarray` or a list of integers, matching the input structure.
*   **Sequence Length:** Preserved between input and output in all examples.
*   **Value Mapping:**
    *   `0` in input maps to `0` in output.
    *   `3` in input maps to `1` or `2`.
*   **Block Transformation Pattern:**
    *   Example 1: First block `3 3 3 3 3` -> `1 1 1 1 1`, Second block `3 3 3 3` -> `2 2 2 2`.
    *   Example 2: First block `3 3 3` -> `2 2 2`, Second block `3 3 3 3 3` -> `1 1 1 1 1`. ***Correction Needed:*** My initial analysis stated the *first* encountered block becomes 1s. Example 2 contradicts this slightly. Let's re-examine.
        *   Train 1: `3 3 3 3 3` (1st) -> `1 1 1 1 1`; `3 3 3 3` (2nd) -> `2 2 2 2`
        *   Train 2: `3 3 3` (1st) -> `2 2 2`; `3 3 3 3 3` (2nd) -> `1 1 1 1 1`
        *   Train 3: `3 3` (1st) -> `2 2`; `3 3 3 3 3` (2nd) -> `1 1 1 1 1`
        *   Train 4: `3 3 3 3` (1st) -> `1 1 1 1`; `3 3` (2nd) -> `2 2`
        *   Train 5: `3 3` (1st) -> `2 2`; `3 3 3` (2nd) -> `1 1 1`
        *   Train 6: `3 3` (1st) -> `2 2`; `3 3 3` (2nd) -> `1 1 1`
        *   Train 7: `3 3 3 3 3` (1st) -> `1 1 1 1 1`; `3 3 3` (2nd) -> `2 2 2`

    *   **Revised Observation:** The assignment to `1` or `2` doesn't strictly depend on the *order* of appearance (1st vs 2nd). It seems to alternate. Let's refine the hypothesis: The transformation assigns `1` and `2` to the blocks of `3`s, but the *which block gets which number* rule needs clarification. Looking again:
        *   Train 1: 1st block (5 items) -> 1s; 2nd block (4 items) -> 2s
        *   Train 2: 1st block (3 items) -> 2s; 2nd block (5 items) -> 1s
        *   Train 3: 1st block (2 items) -> 2s; 2nd block (5 items) -> 1s
        *   Train 4: 1st block (4 items) -> 1s; 2nd block (2 items) -> 2s
        *   Train 5: 1st block (2 items) -> 2s; 2nd block (3 items) -> 1s
        *   Train 6: 1st block (2 items) -> 2s; 2nd block (3 items) -> 1s
        *   Train 7: 1st block (5 items) -> 1s; 2nd block (3 items) -> 2s

    *   **Hypothesis 2 (Alternating Assignment):** Could it be that the *first* block gets assigned `1`, the *second* gets `2`, regardless of other properties? No, Train 2, 3, 5, 6 contradict this.
    *   **Hypothesis 3 (Length-Based Assignment?):** Does the longer block get `1` and the shorter get `2`?
        *   Train 1: Longer (5) -> 1s; Shorter (4) -> 2s (Consistent)
        *   Train 2: Longer (5) -> 1s; Shorter (3) -> 2s (Consistent)
        *   Train 3: Longer (5) -> 1s; Shorter (2) -> 2s (Consistent)
        *   Train 4: Longer (4) -> 1s; Shorter (2) -> 2s (Consistent)
        *   Train 5: Longer (3) -> 1s; Shorter (2) -> 2s (Consistent)
        *   Train 6: Longer (3) -> 1s; Shorter (2) -> 2s (Consistent)
        *   Train 7: Longer (5) -> 1s; Shorter (3) -> 2s (Consistent)
        *   **Conclusion:** It appears the block with the *greater* number of 3s is transformed into 1s, and the block with the *fewer* number of 3s is transformed into 2s. This requires a two-pass approach: first identify the blocks and their lengths, then perform the transformation.

**Revised Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a NumPy array (or list) of integers.
2.  Initialize an empty list to store information about identified blocks of `3`s. Each entry should record the start index, end index, and length of a block.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index. Maintain a state to track if currently inside a block of `3`s and the start index of the current block.
4.  If a `3` is encountered and not currently in a block, mark the start of a new block and record its start index.
5.  If a `0` is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached *while* inside a block of `3`s, mark the end of the current block. Calculate its length and store the block's information (start index, end index, length). Reset the 'in block' state.
6.  After iterating through the entire sequence, analyze the recorded block information. Assume there are exactly two blocks.
7.  Compare the lengths of the two identified blocks.
8.  Determine which block is longer and which is shorter. Assign the target transformation value: `1` for the longer block, `2` for the shorter block.
9.  Create the output sequence, initially as a copy of the input sequence.
10. Iterate through the recorded block information again. For each block:
    a. Retrieve its start index, end index, and determined target transformation value (`1` or `2`).
    b. Replace the elements in the output sequence from the start index to the end index (inclusive) with the target value.
11. Return the modified output sequence (as a NumPy array or list).
