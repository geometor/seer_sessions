"""
Transforms a sequence of digits (provided as a NumPy array) by finding contiguous blocks of '3's. 
If there are exactly two blocks, compares their lengths. 
If the first block's length is greater than or equal to the second block's length, 
the first block becomes '1's and the second becomes '2's in the output sequence. 
Otherwise (if the first block's length is less than the second's), the first block becomes '2's 
and the second becomes '1's. Digits '0' remain unchanged. The output is returned as a 
space-separated string.
