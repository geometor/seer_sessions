**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10`) across all examples indicate a consistent problem with how the input data was passed to the `transform` function during testing. The function likely received the input as a string representation of a Python list (e.g., `'[3, 3, ...]'`) rather than the expected space-separated string of digits (e.g., `'3 3 3 ...'`) or a NumPy array that could be correctly processed. This suggests the issue lies in the testing harness or the interface between the harness and the function, not necessarily in the core transformation logic derived previously.

The strategy is to:
1.  Acknowledge the input format mismatch as the cause of the errors.
2.  Re-verify the transformation logic against the *expected* input/output pairs, assuming the input format issue is resolved.
3.  Refine the documentation (YAML Facts and Natural Language Program) for clarity and precision based on this re-verification. The core logic identified earlier seems correct for all examples provided, so the updates will focus on clarity rather than changing the fundamental rule.

**Metrics**

Based on re-analysis of the input/output pairs:

*   **Input Format:** Sequence of space-separated digits.
*   **Output Format:** Sequence of space-separated digits.
*   **Sequence Length:** 12 (constant across examples).
*   **Input Alphabet:** {0, 3}
*   **Output Alphabet:** {0, 1, 2}
*   **Invariant Elements:** '0' digits maintain their position and value.
*   **Target Elements for Transformation:** Contiguous blocks of '3's.
*   **Number of '3' Blocks per Example:** Consistently 2.
*   **Block Transformation Logic:**
    *   Find the two blocks of '3's. Let the first be Block A, the second Block B.
    *   Compare lengths: Length(A) vs Length(B).
    *   Assignment:
        *   If Length(A) >= Length(B): Replace Block A with '1's, Block B with '2's.
        *   If Length(A) < Length(B): Replace Block A with '2's, Block B with '1's.
*   **Logic Consistency:** The derived transformation logic correctly maps input to output for all 7 training examples.

**YAML Facts**


```yaml
Task: Transform a sequence by replacing two blocks of '3's based on their relative lengths.

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of digits.
  Length: Fixed (12)
  Alphabet: {'0', '3'}
  Structure: Contains exactly two distinct contiguous blocks of '3's, separated by one or more '0's.

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of digits.
  Length: Fixed (12)
  Alphabet: {'0', '1', '2'}
  Structure: Mirrors input structure; '0's are preserved, '3' blocks are replaced.

Objects_and_Properties:
  - Object: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Digits: List of integers derived from the input string.
      - Length: 12
  - Object: Block_of_3s
    Properties:
      - Start_Index: Position of the first '3' in the block.
      - End_Index: Position of the last '3' in the block.
      - Length: Number of '3's in the block (End_Index - Start_Index + 1).
      - Order: Identifies if it's the first or second block encountered (left-to-right).

Relationships:
  - Input '0' to Output '0': Direct mapping (identity). Position preserved.
  - Input Block_of_3s to Output Block: One-to-one mapping in terms of position and length, but value changes.
  - Between Blocks_of_3s:
      - Existence: Exactly two blocks are assumed based on examples.
      - Comparison: The length of the first block is compared to the length of the second block.

Actions:
  1. Parse the input string into a list of integer digits.
  2. Create a copy of the integer list for the output.
  3. Identify all contiguous blocks of the digit '3', storing their start index, end index, and length.
  4. Verify exactly two blocks of '3's were found.
  5. Designate the first block found as Block A and the second as Block B.
  6. Compare the length of Block A (L_A) and Block B (L_B).
  7. Modify the output list based on the comparison:
     - If L_A >= L_B:
       - Fill positions from Start_A to End_A with '1'.
       - Fill positions from Start_B to End_B with '2'.
     - Else (L_A < L_B):
       - Fill positions from Start_A to End_A with '2'.
       - Fill positions from Start_B to End_B with '1'.
  8. Convert the modified list of digits back to strings.
  9. Join the string digits with spaces to create the final output string.

Assumptions:
  - Input always contains exactly two blocks of '3's.
  - Input digits are only '0' or '3'.
  - Input is a space-separated string of 12 digits.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a string containing 12 space-separated digits, consisting only of '0's and '3's.
2.  Convert this input string into a list of integers. Keep a modifiable copy of this list for building the output.
3.  Scan the integer list from left to right to find all contiguous blocks (sequences of one or more) of the digit '3'. For each block found, record its starting index, ending index, and length.
4.  Identify the first block of '3's found (Block A) and the second block of '3's found (Block B). Assume exactly two such blocks exist.
5.  Compare the length of Block A (L_A) to the length of Block B (L_B).
6.  Based on the comparison:
    *   If L_A is greater than or equal to L_B, then replace all digits corresponding to Block A's indices in the output list with '1', and replace all digits corresponding to Block B's indices with '2'.
    *   If L_A is less than L_B, then replace all digits corresponding to Block A's indices in the output list with '2', and replace all digits corresponding to Block B's indices with '1'.
7.  Leave all '0' digits in the output list unchanged from their original positions.
8.  Convert the integers in the modified output list back into strings.
9.  Join these strings with single spaces to form the final output string.
