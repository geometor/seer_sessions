            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10`) across all examples indicate a consistent problem with how the input data was passed to the `transform` function during testing. The function likely received the input as a string representation of a Python list (e.g., `'[3, 3, ...]'`) rather than the expected space-separated string of digits (e.g., `'3 3 3 ...'`) or a NumPy array that could be correctly processed. This suggests the issue lies in the testing harness or the interface between the harness and the function, not necessarily in the core transformation logic derived previously.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge the input format mismatch as the cause of the errors.\n2.  Re-verify the transformation logic against the *expected* input/output pairs, assuming the input format issue is resolved.\n3.  Refine the documentation (YAML Facts and Natural Language Program) for clarity and precision based on this re-verification. The core logic identified earlier seems correct for all examples provided, so the updates will focus on clarity rather than changing the fundamental rule.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on re-analysis of the input/output pairs:\n\n*   **Input Format:** Sequence of space-separated digits.\n*   **Output Format:** Sequence of space-separated digits.\n*   **Sequence Length:** 12 (constant across examples).\n*   **Input Alphabet:** {0, 3}\n*   **Output Alphabet:** {0, 1, 2}\n*   **Invariant Elements:** '0' digits maintain their position and value.\n*   **Target Elements for Transformation:** Contiguous blocks of '3's.\n*   **Number of '3' Blocks per Example:** Consistently 2.\n*   **Block Transformation Logic:**\n    *   Find the two blocks of '3's. Let the first be Block A, the second Block B.\n    *   Compare lengths: Length(A) vs Length(B).\n    *   Assignment:\n        *   If Length(A) >= Length(B): Replace Block A with '1's, Block B with '2's.\n        *   If Length(A) < Length(B): Replace Block A with '2's, Block B with '1's.\n*   **Logic Consistency:** The derived transformation logic correctly maps input to output for all 7 training examples.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"

Position preserved.\n  - Input Block_of_3s to Output Block: One-to-one mapping in terms of position and length, but value changes.\n  - Between Blocks_of_3s:\n      - Existence: Exactly two blocks are assumed based on examples.\n      - Comparison: The length of the first block is compared to the length of the second block.\n\nActions:\n  1.

Convert the modified list of digits back to strings.\n  9. Join the string digits with spaces to create the final output string.\n\nAssumptions:\n  - Input always contains exactly two blocks of '3's.\n  - Input digits are only '0' or '3'.\n  - Input is a space-separated string of 12 digits.\n\n```"
