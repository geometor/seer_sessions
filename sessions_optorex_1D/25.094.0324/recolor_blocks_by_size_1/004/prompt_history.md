Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces. The length of the sequence remains constant (12 digits in all examples).
2.  **Key Digits:** The digits '0' and '3' appear frequently in the input. The output contains '0', '1', and '2'.
3.  **Role of '0':** The digit '0' seems to act as a separator or placeholder. Its position and value remain unchanged from input to output in all examples.
4.  **Role of '3':** The digit '3' appears in contiguous blocks (sequences of one or more '3's). These blocks are the primary elements being transformed.
5.  **Transformation:** The blocks of '3's in the input are replaced by blocks of '1's or '2's in the output. The length of the block remains the same after transformation (e.g., `3 3 3` becomes `1 1 1` or `2 2 2`).
6.  **Number of Blocks:** In all provided examples, there are exactly two distinct blocks of '3's separated by '0's.
7.  **Assignment Rule:** The assignment of '1' or '2' to a block seems to depend on the relative lengths of the two blocks of '3's.
    *   Comparing the lengths of the first block of '3's (L1) and the second block of '3's (L2):
        *   If L1 is greater than or equal to L2, the first block becomes '1's and the second block becomes '2's. (Examples: train_1, train_3, train_6, train_7)
        *   If L1 is less than L2, the first block becomes '2's and the second block becomes '1's. (Examples: train_2, train_4, train_5)

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Replace blocks of '3's based on relative block lengths.

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    - Name: Digit
      Properties:
        Value: Integer (0 or 3 observed)
  Structure: Contains contiguous blocks of '3's separated by '0's.

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    - Name: Digit
      Properties:
        Value: Integer (0, 1, or 2 observed)
  Structure: Mirrors input structure, with '3' blocks replaced.

Objects_and_Properties:
  - Object: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Digits: List of integers
      - Length: Fixed integer (12)
  - Object: Block
    Properties:
      - Value: The repeated digit (e.g., 3)
      - Start_Index: Position of the first digit in the block
      - End_Index: Position of the last digit in the block
      - Length: Number of digits in the block
      - Order: Position relative to other blocks of the same value (e.g., 1st block of 3s, 2nd block of 3s)

Relationships:
  - Between input and output digits:
      - If input digit is 0, output digit is 0.
      - If input digit is 3, output digit depends on the block it belongs to.
  - Between blocks of '3's:
      - There are exactly two blocks of '3's in the observed inputs.
      - Comparison: The length of the first block is compared to the length of the second block.

Actions:
  1. Parse the input sequence into digits.
  2. Identify contiguous blocks of the digit '3'.
  3. Store the start index, end index, and length for each block of '3's.
  4. Assuming exactly two blocks are found:
     - Get the first block (Block A) and the second block (Block B).
     - Compare Length(Block A) and Length(Block B).
  5. Create the output sequence:
     - Initialize with the input sequence.
     - If Length(Block A) >= Length(Block B):
       - Replace digits in Block A's positions with '1'.
       - Replace digits in Block B's positions with '2'.
     - Else (Length(Block A) < Length(Block B)):
       - Replace digits in Block A's positions with '2'.
       - Replace digits in Block B's positions with '1'.
  6. Format the output sequence as space-separated digits.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Initialize an output sequence identical to the input sequence.
3.  Find all contiguous blocks (sequences of one or more identical digits) of the digit '3' in the input sequence. Record the start index, end index, and length of each block found.
4.  Assume exactly two blocks of '3's are found. Let the first block be Block A and the second block be Block B.
5.  Compare the length of Block A (L_A) with the length of Block B (L_B).
6.  If L_A is greater than or equal to L_B:
    *   For each position from the start index to the end index of Block A in the output sequence, change the digit to '1'.
    *   For each position from the start index to the end index of Block B in the output sequence, change the digit to '2'.
7.  Else (if L_A is less than L_B):
    *   For each position from the start index to the end index of Block A in the output sequence, change the digit to '2'.
    *   For each position from the start index to the end index of Block B in the output sequence, change the digit to '1'.
8.  Format the modified output sequence as space-separated digits.
