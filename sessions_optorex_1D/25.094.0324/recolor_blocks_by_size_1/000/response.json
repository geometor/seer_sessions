            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the task based on the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces. The length of the sequence remains constant (12 digits in all examples).\n2.  **Key Digits:** The digits '0' and '3' appear frequently in the input. The output contains '0', '1', and '2'.\n3.  **Role of '0':** The digit '0' seems to act as a separator or placeholder. Its position and value remain unchanged from input to output in all examples.\n4.  **Role of '3':** The digit '3' appears in contiguous blocks (sequences of one or more '3's). These blocks are the primary elements being transformed.\n5.  **Transformation:** The blocks of '3's in the input are replaced by blocks of '1's or '2's in the output. The length of the block remains the same after transformation (e.g., `3 3 3` becomes `1 1 1` or `2 2 2`).\n6.  **Number of Blocks:** In all provided examples, there are exactly two distinct blocks of '3's separated by '0's.\n7.  **Assignment Rule:** The assignment of '1' or '2' to a block seems to depend on the relative lengths of the two blocks of '3's.\n    *   Comparing the lengths of the first block of '3's (L1) and the second block of '3's (L2):\n        *   If L1 is greater than or equal to L2, the first block becomes '1's and the second block becomes '2's. (Examples: train_1, train_3, train_6, train_7)\n        *   If L1 is less than L2, the first block becomes '2's and the second block becomes '1's. (Examples: train_2, train_4, train_5)\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
