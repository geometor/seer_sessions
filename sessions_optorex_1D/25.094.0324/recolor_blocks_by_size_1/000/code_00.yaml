Task: Replace blocks of '3's based on relative block lengths.

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    - Name: Digit
      Properties:
        Value: Integer (0 or 3 observed)
  Structure: Contains contiguous blocks of '3's separated by '0's.

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    - Name: Digit
      Properties:
        Value: Integer (0, 1, or 2 observed)
  Structure: Mirrors input structure, with '3' blocks replaced.

Objects_and_Properties:
  - Object: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Digits: List of integers
      - Length: Fixed integer (12)
  - Object: Block
    Properties:
      - Value: The repeated digit (e.g., 3)
      - Start_Index: Position of the first digit in the block
      - End_Index: Position of the last digit in the block
      - Length: Number of digits in the block
      - Order: Position relative to other blocks of the same value (e.g., 1st block of 3s, 2nd block of 3s)

Relationships:
  - Between input and output digits:
      - If input digit is 0, output digit is 0.
      - If input digit is 3, output digit depends on the block it belongs to.
  - Between blocks of '3's:
      - There are exactly two blocks of '3's in the observed inputs.
      - Comparison: The length of the first block is compared to the length of the second block.

Actions:
  1. Parse the input sequence into digits.
  2. Identify contiguous blocks of the digit '3'.
  3. Store the start index, end index, and length for each block of '3's.
  4. Assuming exactly two blocks are found:
     - Get the first block (Block A) and the second block (Block B).
     - Compare Length(Block A) and Length(Block B).
  5. Create the output sequence:
     - Initialize with the input sequence.
     - If Length(Block A) >= Length(Block B):
       - Replace digits in Block A's positions with '1'.
       - Replace digits in Block B's positions with '2'.
     - Else (Length(Block A) < Length(Block B)):
       - Replace digits in Block A's positions with '2'.
       - Replace digits in Block B's positions with '1'.
  6. Format the output sequence as space-separated digits.
