            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue identified by the execution results is an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but the testing environment provided NumPy arrays. The core logic derived from the initial analysis (identifying blocks of '3', comparing their lengths, and assigning '1' or '2' based on the comparison) appears sound when manually walked through with the examples.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to correctly handle NumPy array inputs by converting them to Python lists at the beginning.\n2.  Retain the core block-finding and transformation logic.\n3.  Ensure the output is formatted back into a space-separated string as per the original problem description.\n4.  Update the documentation (YAML facts, natural language program) to reflect the corrected understanding of the input type and the refined process.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe previous execution failed uniformly across all examples due to the input type error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). Therefore, no metrics regarding the correctness of the transformation *logic* could be gathered from that run. The consistent failure confirms the input type assumption was the sole point of failure.\n\nAssuming the input type is corrected:\n\n*   **Input Type:** NumPy array (based on error messages).\n*   **Output Type:** Space-separated string (based on example outputs).\n*   **Core Logic Element:** Identification of exactly two contiguous blocks of the digit '3'.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** Comparison of the lengths of the two identified '3' blocks determines whether the first block becomes '1's and the second '2's (if first length >= second length) or vice-versa (if first length < second length).\n*   **Invariant Element:** The digit '0' remains unchanged in position and value.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
