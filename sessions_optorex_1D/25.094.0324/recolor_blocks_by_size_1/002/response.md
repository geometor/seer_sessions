**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified by the execution results is an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string, but the testing environment provided NumPy arrays. The core logic derived from the initial analysis (identifying blocks of '3', comparing their lengths, and assigning '1' or '2' based on the comparison) appears sound when manually walked through with the examples.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the `transform` function to correctly handle NumPy array inputs by converting them to Python lists at the beginning.
2.  Retain the core block-finding and transformation logic.
3.  Ensure the output is formatted back into a space-separated string as per the original problem description.
4.  Update the documentation (YAML facts, natural language program) to reflect the corrected understanding of the input type and the refined process.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The previous execution failed uniformly across all examples due to the input type error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). Therefore, no metrics regarding the correctness of the transformation *logic* could be gathered from that run. The consistent failure confirms the input type assumption was the sole point of failure.

Assuming the input type is corrected:

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array (based on error messages).
*   **Output Type:** Space-separated string (based on example outputs).
*   **Core Logic Element:** Identification of exactly two contiguous blocks of the digit '3'.
*   **Transformation Rule:** Comparison of the lengths of the two identified '3' blocks determines whether the first block becomes '1's and the second '2's (if first length >= second length) or vice-versa (if first length < second length).
*   **Invariant Element:** The digit '0' remains unchanged in position and value.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Replace blocks of '3's based on relative block lengths in a numerical sequence.

Input:
  Type: NumPy array
  Elements:
    - Name: Digit
      Properties:
        Value: Integer (0 or 3 observed)
  Structure: Contains contiguous blocks of '3's separated by '0's. Length is fixed (12 observed).

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated digits
  Elements:
    - Name: Digit
      Properties:
        Value: Integer (0, 1, or 2 observed)
  Structure: Mirrors input structure in terms of length and '0' positions, with '3' blocks replaced.

Objects_and_Properties:
  - Object: Sequence (handled as NumPy array then Python list)
    Properties:
      - Digits: List of integers
      - Length: Fixed integer (12)
  - Object: Block
    Properties:
      - Value: The repeated digit (specifically 3)
      - Start_Index: Position of the first digit in the block (0-based)
      - End_Index: Position of the last digit in the block (0-based)
      - Length: Number of digits in the block

Relationships:
  - Between input and output digits:
      - If input digit is 0, corresponding output digit is 0.
      - If input digit is 3, corresponding output digit depends on the block it belongs to and the relative lengths of the two '3' blocks.
  - Between blocks of '3's:
      - Assumption: Exactly two blocks of '3's exist in the input.
      - Comparison: The length of the first block (chronologically) is compared to the length of the second block.

Actions:
  1. Convert the input NumPy array into a Python list of integers.
  2. Initialize an output list identical to the converted input list.
  3. Identify all contiguous blocks of the digit '3' in the input list. Record the start index, end index, and length for each block.
  4. Check if exactly two blocks of '3's were found.
  5. If two blocks are found:
     - Get the first block (Block A) and the second block (Block B).
     - Compare Length(Block A) and Length(Block B).
     - If Length(Block A) >= Length(Block B):
       - Replace digits in the output list corresponding to Block A's positions with '1'.
       - Replace digits in the output list corresponding to Block B's positions with '2'.
     - Else (Length(Block A) < Length(Block B)):
       - Replace digits in the output list corresponding to Block A's positions with '2'.
       - Replace digits in the output list corresponding to Block B's positions with '1'.
  6. Convert the modified output list of integers back into a single string with digits separated by spaces.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence, which is a NumPy array of digits.
2.  Convert the input NumPy array into a standard Python list of integers.
3.  Create a modifiable copy of this integer list to serve as the basis for the output.
4.  Find all contiguous blocks (runs of one or more identical digits) of the digit '3' within the list. For each block found, note its starting position, ending position, and its length (number of digits).
5.  Verify that exactly two such blocks of '3's were found.
6.  If two blocks were found, identify the first block (Block A) and the second block (Block B) based on their starting positions.
7.  Compare the length of Block A (L_A) to the length of Block B (L_B).
8.  If L_A is greater than or equal to L_B:
    *   Iterate through the indices covered by Block A (from its start position to its end position) and update the corresponding elements in the output list to the digit '1'.
    *   Iterate through the indices covered by Block B and update the corresponding elements in the output list to the digit '2'.
9.  Otherwise (if L_A is less than L_B):
    *   Iterate through the indices covered by Block A and update the corresponding elements in the output list to the digit '2'.
    *   Iterate through the indices covered by Block B and update the corresponding elements in the output list to the digit '1'.
10. Convert the final list of output digits into strings.
11. Join these digit strings together, separated by single spaces, to form the final output string.
