The logic involving finding two blocks of '3's, comparing their lengths, and replacing them with '1's and '2's based on the comparison appears consistent with all provided input/output pairs. The error messages themselves contain the *expected output* strings, suggesting the issue lies either in the test harness attempting to re-parse the output string as an integer or, more likely, an incompatibility between the expected input format of the `transform` function (`np.ndarray`) and how the input strings were provided or converted during testing.\n\nThe strategy is to reaffirm the previously derived transformation logic, assuming the input string is correctly parsed into a sequence (or NumPy array) of integers before the `transform` function is called. The documentation (YAML facts and Natural Language Program) will be refined for clarity, maintaining the established logic.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on manual analysis of the examples:\n\n| Example   | Input String                    | Block 1 (3s) Length | Block 2 (3s) Length | L1 >= L2 | Expected Output String         |\n| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------ | :------------------ | :------- | :----------------------------- |\n| train\\_1  | `3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0`       | 4                   | 3                   | True     | `1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0`      |\n| train\\_2  | `0 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3`       | 4                   | 5                   | False    | `0 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1`      |\n| train\\_3  | `0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3`       | 4                   | 3                   | True     | `0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2`      |\n| train\\_4  | `3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0`       | 3                   | 5                   | False    | `2 2 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0`      |\n| train\\_5  | `0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0`       | 2                   | 4                   | False    | `0 2 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0`      |\n| train\\_6  | `0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 3`       | 5                   | 2                   | True     | `0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 2`      |\n| train\\_7  | `0 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0`       | 4                   | 3                   | True     | `0 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0 0`      |\n| test\\_1\\* | `3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0`       | 5                   | 3                   | True     | `1 1 1 1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0 0`      |\n\n\\* Input for test\\_1 inferred from the error message containing its expected output.\n\nThe analysis confirms the rule: Find two blocks of '3's. If the first block's length is >= the second's, replace the first with '1's and the second with '2's. Otherwise, replace the first with '2's and the second with '1's. '0's remain unchanged.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
