**General Assessment:**

The errors (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...`) reported during testing do not seem to stem from the core transformation logic derived previously. The logic involving finding two blocks of '3's, comparing their lengths, and replacing them with '1's and '2's based on the comparison appears consistent with all provided input/output pairs. The error messages themselves contain the *expected output* strings, suggesting the issue lies either in the test harness attempting to re-parse the output string as an integer or, more likely, an incompatibility between the expected input format of the `transform` function (`np.ndarray`) and how the input strings were provided or converted during testing.

The strategy is to reaffirm the previously derived transformation logic, assuming the input string is correctly parsed into a sequence (or NumPy array) of integers before the `transform` function is called. The documentation (YAML facts and Natural Language Program) will be refined for clarity, maintaining the established logic.

**Metrics:**

Based on manual analysis of the examples:

| Example   | Input String                    | Block 1 (3s) Length | Block 2 (3s) Length | L1 >= L2 | Expected Output String         |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------ | :------------------ | :------- | :----------------------------- |
| train\_1  | `3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0`       | 4                   | 3                   | True     | `1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0`      |
| train\_2  | `0 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3`       | 4                   | 5                   | False    | `0 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1`      |
| train\_3  | `0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3`       | 4                   | 3                   | True     | `0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2`      |
| train\_4  | `3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0`       | 3                   | 5                   | False    | `2 2 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0`      |
| train\_5  | `0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0`       | 2                   | 4                   | False    | `0 2 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0`      |

\* Input for test\_1 inferred from the error message containing its expected output.

The analysis confirms the rule: Find two blocks of '3's. If the first block's length is >= the second's, replace the first with '1's and the second with '2's. Otherwise, replace the first with '2's and the second with '1's. '0's remain unchanged.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Replace two blocks of '3's in a digit sequence based on their relative lengths.

Input_Representation:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated digits (e.g., "3 3 0 3 3 3")
  Digits_Observed: '0', '3'

Processing_Input:
  Type: Sequence or 1D Array of Integers
  Derivation: Parsed from the Input_Representation string.
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)

Output_Representation:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated digits (e.g., "1 1 0 2 2 2")
  Digits_Observed: '0', '1', '2'

Objects_and_Properties:
  - Object: Digit_Sequence (Processing Input)
    Properties:
      - Elements: List/Array of integers (0 or 3)
      - Length: Integer
  - Object: Digit_Block
    Properties:
      - Digit_Value: The repeated digit (specifically 3)
      - Start_Index: Integer position (0-based)
      - End_Index: Integer position (0-based)
      - Length: Integer count of digits
      - Order: Sequential position (1st, 2nd) among blocks of the same digit value.

Relationships:
  - Input_Digit to Output_Digit:
      - If input is 0, output is 0.
      - If input is 3, output depends on the block it belongs to and relative block lengths.
  - Between Blocks_of_3:
      - Assumption: Exactly two distinct blocks of '3's exist in the input sequence.
      - Comparison: The length of the first block (L1) is compared to the length of the second block (L2).

Actions:
  1. Parse the Input_Representation string into a Digit_Sequence (list/array of integers).
  2. Create a mutable copy of the Digit_Sequence for output construction.
  3. Identify all contiguous blocks of the digit '3' in the sequence, recording their start/end indices and lengths.
  4. Verify that exactly two blocks of '3's were found.
  5. Assign the first found block as Block_A and the second as Block_B.
  6. Compare Length(Block_A) with Length(Block_B).
  7. Apply transformation rule to the output sequence copy:
     - If Length(Block_A) >= Length(Block_B):
       - Replace digits corresponding to Block_A's indices with 1.
       - Replace digits corresponding to Block_B's indices with 2.
     - Else (Length(Block_A) < Length(Block_B)):
       - Replace digits corresponding to Block_A's indices with 2.
       - Replace digits corresponding to Block_B's indices with 1.
  8. Convert the modified integer sequence back into a space-separated string (Output_Representation).

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a single string of space-separated digits.
2.  Convert this input string into a sequence (list or array) of integer digits.
3.  Create a modifiable copy of this integer sequence to serve as the basis for the output.
4.  Scan the integer sequence to locate all contiguous blocks composed solely of the digit '3'. For each block found, record its starting position, ending position, and its length (number of digits).
5.  Assume exactly two such blocks of '3's are present in the sequence. Label them Block A (the one appearing first) and Block B (the one appearing second).
6.  Retrieve the length of Block A (L\_A) and the length of Block B (L\_B).
7.  Compare L\_A and L\_B:
    *   If L\_A is greater than or equal to L\_B:
        *   In the output sequence copy, change every digit within the original positions of Block A to '1'.
        *   In the output sequence copy, change every digit within the original positions of Block B to '2'.
    *   If L\_A is less than L\_B:
        *   In the output sequence copy, change every digit within the original positions of Block A to '2'.
        *   In the output sequence copy, change every digit within the original positions of Block B to '1'.
8.  Convert the elements of the modified integer sequence back to strings.
9.  Join these string elements with single spaces to create the final output string.
10. Return the final output string.
