The key elements are:\n\n1.  **Sequence:** A fixed-length list of integers (length 12 in all examples).\n2.  **Objects:** Non-zero integer values within the sequence. These can be single elements or contiguous blocks of the same non-zero value.\n3.  **Empty Space:** Zero values within the sequence, representing unoccupied positions.\n4.  **Transformation:** A spatial shift applied to the objects within the sequence.\n\nThe core operation is the displacement of all non-zero elements (objects) within the sequence by a fixed amount, while maintaining their relative order and values. The vacated positions are filled with zeros.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
