Transforms an input 1D list of 12 integers by shifting all non-zero elements 
(objects) 4 positions to the right (increasing index). The relative order 
of the objects is preserved. Objects shifted beyond the end of the list 
(index 11) are discarded. Original positions of shifted objects, and any 
positions not filled by a shifted object, become zero in the output list.
