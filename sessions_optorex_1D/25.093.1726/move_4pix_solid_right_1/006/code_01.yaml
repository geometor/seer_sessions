task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    properties:
      - name: structure
        value: 1D array/list of integers
      - name: processing_format # Added based on error analysis
        value: Likely handled as a NumPy array by the execution environment, potentially wrapped in a 2D array structure (e.g., shape (1, N))
      - name: length
        value: 12 (constant across examples)
      - name: element_types
        values: [integer]
  - type: object
    properties:
      - name: representation
        value: non-zero integer values
      - name: characteristic
        value: can be single or contiguous blocks
      - name: state
        value: position (index) within the sequence
  - type: empty_space
    properties:
      - name: representation
        value: zero integer value
      - name: state
        value: position (index) within the sequence
relationships:
  - type: relative_position
    between: [object, object]
    characteristic: maintained during transformation
actions:
  - type: shift
    target: object(s)
    properties:
      - name: direction
        value: right (increasing index)
      - name: distance
        value: 4 positions (index + 4)
      - name: boundary_condition
        value: Objects shifted beyond the sequence boundary (index >= length) are discarded.
      - name: effect
        value: changes position state of objects, fills original positions and unassigned target positions with empty_space (zero)
