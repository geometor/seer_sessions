**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on one-dimensional sequences (arrays or lists) of integers. The key elements are:

1.  **Sequence:** A fixed-length list of integers (length 12 in all examples).
2.  **Objects:** Non-zero integer values within the sequence. These can be single elements or contiguous blocks of the same non-zero value.
3.  **Empty Space:** Zero values within the sequence, representing unoccupied positions.
4.  **Transformation:** A spatial shift applied to the objects within the sequence.

The core operation is the displacement of all non-zero elements (objects) within the sequence by a fixed amount, while maintaining their relative order and values. The vacated positions are filled with zeros.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-zero elements (objects) and their indices in the input sequence.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros (empty space).
3.  For each identified object in the input sequence at index `i`, place that object's value into the output sequence at index `i + 4`.
4.  Ensure that the relative order of the objects is preserved in the output sequence.
5.  The resulting sequence is the final output.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a boolean context that expects a single `True` or `False` value, such as a standard Python `if` statement. Given that the code was written expecting `list[int]` but the error is NumPy-related, it's highly probable that the execution environment or test harness converts the input data (represented as strings) into NumPy arrays before passing them to the `transform` function. Furthermore, the error suggests that the iteration `for i, val in enumerate(input_grid):` might be iterating over rows of a 2D array (e.g., `[[0, 0, 8, ...]]`) rather than elements of a 1D array. In this scenario, `val` would be a 1D array (a row), and the condition `if val != 0:` would attempt to compare an array to a scalar, resulting in a boolean array which cannot be evaluated as a single truth value in the `if` statement.

The core logic identified previously (shifting non-zero elements 4 positions to the right) appears correct based on a manual inspection of the examples. The strategy to resolve the error is to modify the code to correctly handle NumPy array inputs, potentially by ensuring the code operates on a flattened 1D array or by explicitly accessing the first row if the input is indeed a 2D array with a single row.

*Summary of Metrics:*
Across all training examples:
*   The input and output sequences consistently have a length of 12.
*   The input strings parse correctly into 1D structures.
*   All non-zero elements ('objects') from the input appear in the output, maintaining their original values.
*   The relative order of objects is preserved.
*   Every object is shifted exactly 4 positions to the right (index increases by 4).
*   Objects shifted beyond the maximum index (11) are implicitly discarded (though no examples explicitly show this).

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence, potentially as a NumPy array (possibly 2D with one row). Ensure processing operates on a 1D representation of the sequence (e.g., flatten or select the first row if necessary). Let the length of this sequence be `L` (which is 12 in the examples).
2.  Create a new output sequence of length `L`, initialized entirely with zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence from index `i = 0` to `L-1`.
4.  For each element `val` at index `i` in the input sequence:
    *   If `val` is not zero (i.e., it's an 'object'):
        *   Calculate the target index `new_index = i + 4`.
        *   If `new_index` is less than `L` (i.e., within the bounds of the sequence):
            *   Place the value `val` at `new_index` in the output sequence.
5.  Return the completed output sequence.
