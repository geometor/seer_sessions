**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on one-dimensional sequences (arrays or lists) of integers. The key elements are:

1.  **Sequence:** A fixed-length list of integers (length 12 in all examples).
2.  **Objects:** Non-zero integer values within the sequence. These can be single elements or contiguous blocks of the same non-zero value.
3.  **Empty Space:** Zero values within the sequence, representing unoccupied positions.
4.  **Transformation:** A spatial shift applied to the objects within the sequence.

The core operation is the displacement of all non-zero elements (objects) within the sequence by a fixed amount, while maintaining their relative order and values. The vacated positions are filled with zeros.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify all non-zero elements (objects) and their indices in the input sequence.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled with zeros (empty space).
3.  For each identified object in the input sequence at index `i`, place that object's value into the output sequence at index `i + 4`.
4.  Ensure that the relative order of the objects is preserved in the output sequence.
5.  The resulting sequence is the final output.

**General Assessment:**

The previous code attempt failed across all examples with a `ValueError`, indicating an issue with how boolean conditions were evaluated, likely due to the input data being treated as a NumPy array instead of a simple list of integers within the testing environment, even though the function signature specified `list[int]`. The core transformation logic observed (shifting non-zero elements 4 positions to the right) appears consistent across the examples, but the implementation needs to be robust against the actual data type provided during execution or the testing harness needs adjustment.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the transformation rule (shift distance, boundary handling) by analyzing the input/output pairs quantitatively.
2.  Assume the intended input is conceptually a list/sequence of integers, even if the runtime type causes issues.
3.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts based on the confirmed transformation rule. The subsequent coding phase will need to address the type mismatch error, potentially by explicitly converting the input to a list or using NumPy-aware comparisons if the input is indeed always an array.

**Gather Metrics:**

Let's analyze each training example to confirm the transformation properties (shift distance, length).

```
**Findings from Metrics:**

*   **Length:** All input and output sequences consistently have a length of 12.
*   **Shift:** In every example, the non-zero elements are shifted exactly 4 positions to the right (index increases by 4).
*   **Values:** The values of the non-zero elements are preserved during the shift.
*   **Relative Order:** The relative order of non-zero elements is maintained.
*   **Boundary Condition:** The examples provided do not explicitly show elements being shifted *off* the right end of the sequence. However, the consistent +4 shift implies that any element at index 8 or higher in the input would be shifted beyond index 11 and thus would not appear in the output. The resulting output positions are filled with the shifted elements, and all other positions are 0.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize a new output sequence of length 12, filled entirely with zeros.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence, examining each element at its index `i`.
3.  If the element at index `i` in the input sequence is non-zero (it's an object):
    a.  Calculate the target index `new_index = i + 4`.
    b.  Check if `new_index` is less than 12 (i.e., within the bounds of the sequence).
    c.  If `new_index` is within bounds, copy the non-zero value from the input sequence at index `i` to the output sequence at `new_index`.
4.  After checking all elements in the input sequence, the output sequence contains the transformed result. Return the output sequence.
