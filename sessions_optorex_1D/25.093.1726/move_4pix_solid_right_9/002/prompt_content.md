"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers by shifting all non-zero elements 4 positions to the right.
The output sequence is initialized with zeros. For each non-zero element in the input sequence at index i,
if the target index i + 4 is within the bounds of the sequence (0 to 11), the non-zero element is placed
at that target index in the output sequence. Positions in the output sequence that do not receive a
shifted non-zero element remain zero.
