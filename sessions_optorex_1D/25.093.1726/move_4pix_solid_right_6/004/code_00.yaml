objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: list of list of integers or 2D NumPy array
      dimensions: 1x12
      properties:
        - contains a single row
        - the row contains a sequence of 12 integers
        - the row typically has a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
        - other elements in the row are zero
  - output_grid:
      type: list of list of integers or 2D NumPy array
      dimensions: 1x12
      properties:
        - contains a single row derived from the input_grid's row
        - the row contains the same non-zero digits as the input row, shifted
        - remaining elements in the row are zero
  - data_row:
      type: list or 1D NumPy array of integers
      length: 12
      source: extracted from the single row of input_grid
  - non_zero_element:
      type: integer
      properties:
        - value is not 0
        - located within the data_row
  - zero:
      type: integer
      value: 0
      role: fill value for padding
constants:
  - grid_rows: 1
  - grid_cols: 12
  - shift_amount: 4
actions:
  - extract_row: get the single row (1D sequence) from the input_grid
  - initialize_output_row: create a new 1D sequence of length 12, filled with zeros
  - iterate: loop through the elements of the extracted data_row using an index `i`
  - check_non_zero: determine if the element at index `i` is not zero
  - calculate_target_index: compute the destination index `j = i + shift_amount`
  - check_bounds: verify if the target index `j` is within the valid range [0, 11]
  - assign_value: if non-zero and within bounds, copy the element from data_row[i] to output_row[j]
  - format_output: place the generated output_row into a 1x12 grid structure (list of lists or 2D array)
relationships:
  - transformation: input_grid is transformed into output_grid
  - row_correspondence: the row in output_grid is derived from the row in input_grid
  - shifting_rule: each non-zero element at index `i` in the input row is moved to index `i + 4` in the output row
  - boundary_condition: non-zero elements whose target index `i + 4` is 12 or greater are discarded
  - padding_rule: positions in the output row not filled by shifted non-zero elements are filled with zeros
