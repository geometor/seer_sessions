            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe consistent error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the data structure the `transform` function expects and the data structure it receives. The error occurs during the comparison `element != fill_value`, suggesting that `element` is an array, not a scalar value.\n\nThis strongly implies that the input `input_sequence` passed to the function is not a 1D list or array of numbers, but rather a 2D structure, likely a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[8, 8, ..., 0]]`) or a 2D NumPy array (shape (1, 12)). When the code iterates with `i` and accesses `input_array[i]`, it retrieves the entire first row (for `i=0`) if `input_array` is 2D, leading to the error when comparing this row array to the scalar `0`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Modify the function to correctly handle the assumed 2D input format (1x12). This involves extracting the single row from the input structure before iterating through its elements.\n2.  Maintain the core transformation logic: identify non-zero elements in the extracted row and shift them 4 positions to the right, padding with zeros.\n3.  Ensure the output format matches the input format (i.e., return a 1x12 2D structure).\n4.  Update the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) to reflect the 2D nature of the data.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nThe tool execution confirms the hypothesis:\n- The input array likely has `shape=(1, 12)` and `ndim=2`.\n- Accessing `input_array[0]` retrieves the entire row `[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]`.\n- Comparing this row array directly with `0` using `!=` raises the `ValueError`.\n- The corrected logic, which extracts the row first (`input_array_1d = np.array(input_sequence_2d)[0]`) and then applies the shift, produces the correct output for all tested examples, including boundary conditions.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
