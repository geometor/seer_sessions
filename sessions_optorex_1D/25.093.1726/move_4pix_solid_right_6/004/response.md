**General Assessment and Strategy**

The consistent error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the data structure the `transform` function expects and the data structure it receives. The error occurs during the comparison `element != fill_value`, suggesting that `element` is an array, not a scalar value.

This strongly implies that the input `input_sequence` passed to the function is not a 1D list or array of numbers, but rather a 2D structure, likely a list containing a single list (e.g., `[[8, 8, ..., 0]]`) or a 2D NumPy array (shape (1, 12)). When the code iterates with `i` and accesses `input_array[i]`, it retrieves the entire first row (for `i=0`) if `input_array` is 2D, leading to the error when comparing this row array to the scalar `0`.

**Strategy:**
1.  Modify the function to correctly handle the assumed 2D input format (1x12). This involves extracting the single row from the input structure before iterating through its elements.
2.  Maintain the core transformation logic: identify non-zero elements in the extracted row and shift them 4 positions to the right, padding with zeros.
3.  Ensure the output format matches the input format (i.e., return a 1x12 2D structure).
4.  Update the documentation (Facts and Natural Language Program) to reflect the 2D nature of the data.

**Metrics and Verification**

The tool execution confirms the hypothesis:
- The input array likely has `shape=(1, 12)` and `ndim=2`.
- Accessing `input_array[0]` retrieves the entire row `[8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]`.
- Comparing this row array directly with `0` using `!=` raises the `ValueError`.
- The corrected logic, which extracts the row first (`input_array_1d = np.array(input_sequence_2d)[0]`) and then applies the shift, produces the correct output for all tested examples, including boundary conditions.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - input_grid:
      type: list of list of integers or 2D NumPy array
      dimensions: 1x12
      properties:
        - contains a single row
        - the row contains a sequence of 12 integers
        - the row typically has a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
        - other elements in the row are zero
  - output_grid:
      type: list of list of integers or 2D NumPy array
      dimensions: 1x12
      properties:
        - contains a single row derived from the input_grid's row
        - the row contains the same non-zero digits as the input row, shifted
        - remaining elements in the row are zero
  - data_row:
      type: list or 1D NumPy array of integers
      length: 12
      source: extracted from the single row of input_grid
  - non_zero_element:
      type: integer
      properties:
        - value is not 0
        - located within the data_row
  - zero:
      type: integer
      value: 0
      role: fill value for padding
constants:
  - grid_rows: 1
  - grid_cols: 12
  - shift_amount: 4
actions:
  - extract_row: get the single row (1D sequence) from the input_grid
  - initialize_output_row: create a new 1D sequence of length 12, filled with zeros
  - iterate: loop through the elements of the extracted data_row using an index `i`
  - check_non_zero: determine if the element at index `i` is not zero
  - calculate_target_index: compute the destination index `j = i + shift_amount`
  - check_bounds: verify if the target index `j` is within the valid range [0, 11]
  - assign_value: if non-zero and within bounds, copy the element from data_row[i] to output_row[j]
  - format_output: place the generated output_row into a 1x12 grid structure (list of lists or 2D array)
relationships:
  - transformation: input_grid is transformed into output_grid
  - row_correspondence: the row in output_grid is derived from the row in input_grid
  - shifting_rule: each non-zero element at index `i` in the input row is moved to index `i + 4` in the output row
  - boundary_condition: non-zero elements whose target index `i + 4` is 12 or greater are discarded
  - padding_rule: positions in the output row not filled by shifted non-zero elements are filled with zeros
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input, which is structured as a 1x12 grid (e.g., a list containing one list of 12 integers).
2.  Extract the single row of 12 integers from the input grid. Let this be the `data_row`.
3.  Create a new `output_row` consisting of 12 zeros.
4.  Iterate through the `data_row` from the first element (index 0) to the last element (index 11). Let the current index be `i` and the element be `element`.
5.  If `element` is not zero:
    a.  Calculate the target index `j` by adding 4 to the current index `i` (`j = i + 4`).
    b.  Check if the target index `j` is within the valid range of column indices for the grid (0 to 11).
    c.  If `j` is within the valid range, place the `element` into the `output_row` at index `j`.
6.  After iterating through all elements of the `data_row`, package the `output_row` back into the original 1x12 grid structure (e.g., place it inside a list).
7.  Return the resulting 1x12 grid.
