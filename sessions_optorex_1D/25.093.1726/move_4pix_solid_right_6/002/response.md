## General Assessment

The core transformation logic identified previously – shifting non-zero elements 4 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence of 12, padding with zeros, and handling boundary conditions – appears consistent across all training examples.

The error message `Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates a type mismatch during execution. The provided code expects a string input (`input_sequence_str.split()`) but receives a NumPy array instead. This is likely due to the execution environment automatically converting the input representation into a NumPy array before passing it to the `transform` function.

The strategy is to modify the understanding and the subsequent natural language program to assume the input is a sequence of integers (like a list or NumPy array) rather than a string. The core shifting logic remains the same, but the initial parsing step (`split()`) needs to be removed or adapted.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the key parameters using the provided examples.

*   **Sequence Length:** All input and output sequences consistently have 12 elements.
*   **Shift Amount:** In every example, the block of non-zero numbers is shifted exactly 4 positions to the right.
    *   Example 1: `8`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.
    *   Example 2: `1`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.
    *   Example 3: `8`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.
    *   Example 4: `5`s start at index 2 -> start at index 6. Shift = 4.
    *   Example 5: `6`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.
    *   Example 6: `4`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.
    *   Example 7: `2`s start at index 3 -> start at index 7. Shift = 4.
*   **Padding:** Positions not occupied by the shifted non-zero elements are always filled with 0.
*   **Boundary Handling:** Elements shifted beyond index 11 are implicitly discarded (e.g., in Example 7, the last `2` is at index 7, shifted to 11; if there was a `2` at index 8, it would be discarded).

The analysis confirms the transformation is a fixed right shift by 4 positions for non-zero elements within a 12-element sequence.

## Updated Facts


```yaml
objects:
  - input_sequence:
      type: sequence of integers (e.g., list or NumPy array)
      length: 12
      properties:
        - contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
        - remaining elements are zero
  - output_sequence:
      type: sequence of integers (e.g., list or NumPy array)
      length: 12
      properties:
        - contains the same contiguous block of non-zero digits as the input, shifted right
        - remaining elements are zero
  - non_zero_element:
      type: integer
      properties:
        - value is not 0
  - zero_element:
      type: integer
      value: 0
  - shift_amount:
      type: integer
      value: 4
  - sequence_length:
      type: integer
      value: 12
actions:
  - create: generate a new sequence of `sequence_length` filled with `zero_element`
  - iterate: process each element of the `input_sequence` by its index `i`
  - check: determine if an element at index `i` is a `non_zero_element`
  - calculate_target_index: compute `j = i + shift_amount`
  - check_bounds: verify if `j` is less than `sequence_length`
  - copy_element: place the `non_zero_element` from `input_sequence[i]` into `output_sequence[j]`
relationships:
  - transformation: `input_sequence` is transformed into `output_sequence`
  - shifting_rule: each `non_zero_element` at index `i` in the `input_sequence` is moved to index `i + shift_amount` in the `output_sequence`, provided `i + shift_amount` is less than `sequence_length`
  - padding_rule: positions in the `output_sequence` not filled by shifted `non_zero_element`s remain `zero_element`
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initially all set to 0.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from 0 to 11.
4.  For each element at index `i` in the input sequence:
    a.  Check if the element is non-zero.
    b.  If the element is non-zero:
        i.  Calculate the target index `j` by adding 4 to the current index `i` (`j = i + 4`).
        ii. Check if the target index `j` is less than 12 (i.e., within the valid index range 0-11).
        iii. If `j` is less than 12, copy the non-zero element from the input sequence at index `i` to the output sequence at index `j`.
5.  Return the final output sequence.
