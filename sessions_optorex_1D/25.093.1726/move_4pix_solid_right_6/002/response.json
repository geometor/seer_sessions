            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously \u2013 shifting non-zero elements 4 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence of 12, padding with zeros, and handling boundary conditions \u2013 appears consistent across all training examples.\n\nThe error message `Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates a type mismatch during execution. The provided code expects a string input (`input_sequence_str.split()`) but receives a NumPy array instead. This is likely due to the execution environment automatically converting the input representation into a NumPy array before passing it to the `transform` function.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the understanding and the subsequent natural language program to assume the input is a sequence of integers (like a list or NumPy array) rather than a string. The core shifting logic remains the same, but the initial parsing step (`split()`) needs to be removed or adapted.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nLet's verify the key parameters using the provided examples.\n\n*   **Sequence Length:** All input and output sequences consistently have 12 elements.\n*   **Shift Amount:** In every example, the block of non-zero numbers is shifted exactly 4 positions to the right.\n    *   Example 1: `8`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.\n    *   Example 2: `1`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.\n    *   Example 3: `8`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.\n    *   Example 4: `5`s start at index 2 -> start at index 6. Shift = 4.\n    *   Example 5: `6`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.\n    *   Example 6: `4`s start at index 0 -> start at index 4. Shift = 4.\n    *   Example 7: `2`s start at index 3 -> start at index 7. Shift = 4.\n*   **Padding:** Positions not occupied by the shifted non-zero elements are always filled with 0.\n*   **Boundary Handling:** Elements shifted beyond index 11 are implicitly discarded (e.g., in Example 7, the last `2` is at index 7, shifted to 11; if there was a `2` at index 8, it would be discarded).\n\nThe analysis confirms the transformation is a fixed right shift by 4 positions for non-zero elements within a 12-element sequence.\n\n## Updated Facts\n\n"
