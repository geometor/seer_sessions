            "text": "*   **General Assessment**:\n    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting non-zero elements 4 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence.\n    *   The provided Python code implements this logic.\n    *   However, the code failed execution on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.\n    *   This error strongly suggests that the `input_sequence` variable, assumed to be a 1D list or array, is actually being passed as a 2D NumPy array (likely shape 1xN, where N is the sequence length) by the testing environment.\n    *   The loop `for index, element in enumerate(input_sequence):` iterates through the *rows* of the 2D array. In the case of a 1xN input, the loop runs only once, with `element` being the entire row (a 1D array). The condition `if element != 0:` then attempts to evaluate the truthiness of a boolean array resulting from the element-wise comparison, causing the error.\n*   **Strategy**:\n    *   The primary issue is adapting the code to handle the input as a 2D NumPy array (specifically, a 1xN array based on the examples).\n    *   The code needs to access the actual 1D sequence data, presumably the first row of the input array.\n    *   The core shifting logic remains the same.\n    *   The natural language program and facts should be updated to reflect the structure of the input data accurately.\n\n*   **Metrics**:\n    *   The code failed before producing any output, so comparison metrics aren't applicable.\n    *   Re-validation of the transformation rule:\n        *   Example 1: `9` at index 6 -> index 10 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 2: `6` at index 3 -> index 7 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 3: `5`s at indices 3, 4, 5 -> indices 7, 8, 9 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 4: `6`s at indices 3, 4, 5, 6 -> indices 7, 8, 9, 10 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 5: `4` at index 7 -> index 11 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 6: `9`s at indices 4, 5 -> indices 8, 9 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 7: `8`s at indices 1-7 -> indices 5-11 (Shift +4)\n    *   The shift rule of +4 positions to the right holds consistently across all examples. The implementation needs correction for data type/structure handling.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
