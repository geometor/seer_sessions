*   **Perception**:
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits.
    *   All sequences provided have a length of 12.
    *   The sequences contain primarily zeros (0) and contiguous or single blocks of non-zero digits.
    *   The transformation involves repositioning the non-zero digits within the sequence.
    *   The non-zero digits maintain their values and relative order from input to output.
    *   The block of non-zero digits appears to be shifted consistently to the right by a fixed amount.
    *   Comparing the index of the first non-zero digit in the input and output reveals a shift of 4 positions to the right in all examples.
    *   The positions vacated by the shift, and positions to the left of the original block, are filled with zeros in the output. Positions to the right remain zero unless filled by the shifted block.

*   **Facts**:

*   **General Assessment**:
    *   The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting non-zero elements 4 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence.
    *   The provided Python code implements this logic.
    *   However, the code failed execution on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.
    *   This error strongly suggests that the `input_sequence` variable, assumed to be a 1D list or array, is actually being passed as a 2D NumPy array (likely shape 1xN, where N is the sequence length) by the testing environment.
    *   The loop `for index, element in enumerate(input_sequence):` iterates through the *rows* of the 2D array. In the case of a 1xN input, the loop runs only once, with `element` being the entire row (a 1D array). The condition `if element != 0:` then attempts to evaluate the truthiness of a boolean array resulting from the element-wise comparison, causing the error.
*   **Strategy**:
    *   The primary issue is adapting the code to handle the input as a 2D NumPy array (specifically, a 1xN array based on the examples).
    *   The code needs to access the actual 1D sequence data, presumably the first row of the input array.
    *   The core shifting logic remains the same.
    *   The natural language program and facts should be updated to reflect the structure of the input data accurately.

*   **Metrics**:
    *   The code failed before producing any output, so comparison metrics aren't applicable.
    *   Re-validation of the transformation rule:
        *   Example 1: `9` at index 6 -> index 10 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 2: `6` at index 3 -> index 7 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 3: `5`s at indices 3, 4, 5 -> indices 7, 8, 9 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 4: `6`s at indices 3, 4, 5, 6 -> indices 7, 8, 9, 10 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 5: `4` at index 7 -> index 11 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 6: `9`s at indices 4, 5 -> indices 8, 9 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 7: `8`s at indices 1-7 -> indices 5-11 (Shift +4)
    *   The shift rule of +4 positions to the right holds consistently across all examples. The implementation needs correction for data type/structure handling.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Receive the input, which is structured as a 2D NumPy array containing a single row of 12 digits.
    2.  Extract the 1D sequence of digits from the first (and only) row of the input array. Let the length of this sequence be L (L=12).
    3.  Create a new 1D output sequence of length L, initialized with all zeros.
    4.  Iterate through the extracted 1D input sequence using an index, from 0 to L-1.
    5.  For each element at the current index in the input sequence:
        a.  If the element is not zero:
            i.  Calculate the target index by adding 4 to the current index.
            ii. If the target index is within the bounds of the sequence (0 to L-1):
                Place the non-zero element at this target index in the output sequence.
    6.  Return the completed 1D output sequence.
