"""
Transforms an input 1x12 grid (represented as a 2D NumPy array) by shifting all non-zero digits 4 positions to the right within the sequence.

1. Receive the input 2D NumPy array (1x12).
2. Extract the 1D sequence from the first row.
3. Determine the sequence length (L=12).
4. Create a new 1D output list of length L, initialized with zeros.
5. Iterate through the extracted 1D input sequence with an index (0 to L-1).
6. If an element at the current index is non-zero:
   a. Calculate the target index by adding 4 to the current index.
   b. If the target index is within the sequence bounds (0 to L-1):
      Place the non-zero element at the target index in the output list.
7. Return the completed 1D output list.
