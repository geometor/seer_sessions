            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers in a 1D NumPy array and shifting this block 4 positions to the right in a new list initialized with zeros. The core logic (identifying the block and shifting it by 4) appears correct based on the examples.\n    The error `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars` occurring consistently across all examples strongly suggests an issue with how NumPy data types are being handled, likely when comparing a NumPy array element to a Python scalar or when attempting to cast a NumPy type (like `np.int64`) to a standard Python `int` using `int()`, especially if the value being cast isn't a single scalar element as expected. The error might stem from the `find_block` function returning a value that isn't a simple scalar, or the `transform` function mishandling this returned value (specifically `block_value`) during the assignment `output_list[i] = int(block_value)`.\n    The strategy is to ensure that the block's value is correctly extracted as a Python scalar type before it's used in comparisons or assignments within the `transform` function. Using the `.item()` method on the NumPy array element when retrieving the block's value in `find_block` is a robust way to achieve this.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n\n    | Example | Input Block (Value, Start, End, Len) | Output Block (Value, Start, End, Len) | Shift | Consistent Shift (4)? | Error? |\n    | :------ | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :---- | :-------------------- | :----- |\n    | train_1 | (2, 3, 5, 2)                         | (2, 7, 9, 2)                          | 4     | Yes                   | Yes    |\n    | train_2 | (6, 2, 6, 4)                         | (6, 6, 10, 4)                         | 4     | Yes                   | Yes    |\n    | train_3 | (5, 0, 1, 1)                         | (5, 4, 5, 1)                          | 4     | Yes                   | Yes    |\n    | train_4 | (5, 6, 7, 1)                         | (5, 10, 11, 1)                        | 4     | Yes                   | Yes    |\n    | train_5 | (9, 2, 5, 3)                         | (9, 6, 9, 3)                          | 4     | Yes                   | Yes    |\n    | train_6 | (4, 2, 6, 4)                         | (4, 6, 10, 4)                         | 4     | Yes                   | Yes    |\n    | train_7 | (1, 6, 7, 1)                         | (1, 10, 11, 1)                        | 4     | Yes                   | Yes    |\n\n    **Findings:**\n    *   All inputs are 1D sequences of length 12.\n    *   All outputs are 1D sequences of length 12.\n    *   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.\n    *   The non-zero value, block length, and start/end indices vary.\n    *   The transformation consistently involves shifting the identified block exactly 4 positions to the right.\n    *   The block's value and length are preserved in the output.\n    *   The output sequence is initialized with zeros, and only the positions corresponding to the shifted block are filled with the block's value.\n    *   The error occurred in all examples, indicating a systematic issue in the code's handling of data types rather than an issue specific to certain input patterns.\n\n*   **YAML Fact Document:**\n\n    "
