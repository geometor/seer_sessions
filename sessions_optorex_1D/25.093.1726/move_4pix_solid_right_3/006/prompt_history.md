*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
    *   The sequences primarily contain the integer 0.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
    *   The transformation involves moving this non-zero block within the sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the 12-element input sequence. Note its starting index, ending index, and the value of the integers in the block.
    2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 4 to the original starting index found in step 1.
    4.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 4 to the original ending index found in step 1.
    5.  Place the identified non-zero block (using the value from step 1) into the output sequence starting at the new starting index and ending at the new ending index calculated in steps 3 and 4.
    6.  Return the modified output sequence.
