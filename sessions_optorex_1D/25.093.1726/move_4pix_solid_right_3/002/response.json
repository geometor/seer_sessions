            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical integers and shifting it 4 positions to the right within a 12-element sequence. The execution results indicate a fundamental type mismatch error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This suggests the execution environment passes the input data as NumPy arrays, while the original code was likely written assuming standard Python lists, leading to improper boolean evaluation of array comparisons.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Input Type:** Assume the input is a NumPy array of integers.\n2.  **Adapt Logic:** Modify the block finding and shifting logic to correctly handle NumPy array operations or ensure the input is converted to a list before processing if list-based logic is preferred. The core transformation rule (shift block right by 4) appears correct based on the input/output pairs.\n3.  **Verify Implementation:** Use code execution to test the adapted logic against all examples, confirming block identification (value, start, end) and the final shifted output match expectations.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nBased on the analysis and successful execution of the adapted NumPy code (`transform_np` in the thought process):\n\n*   **Input Type:** Assumed to be a 1D NumPy array of 12 integers based on the error message and successful test using NumPy.\n*   **Output Type:** Expected to be a standard Python list of 12 integers (as demonstrated in the original prompt's output format). The adapted code returns a list.\n*   **Block Identification:** The `find_block_np` logic correctly identifies the single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers.\n    *   Example 1: value=2, start=3, end=5 (length 2)\n    *   Example 2: value=6, start=2, end=6 (length 4)\n    *   Example 3: value=5, start=0, end=1 (length 1)\n    *   Example 4: value=5, start=6, end=7 (length 1)\n    *   Example 5: value=9, start=2, end=5 (length 3) - *Inferred*\n    *   Example 6: value=4, start=2, end=6 (length 4) - *Inferred*\n    *   Example 7: value=1, start=6, end=7 (length 1)\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The non-zero block is consistently shifted 4 positions to the right.\n    *   New Start = Old Start + 4\n    *   New End = Old End + 4\n*   **Output Construction:** A new array/list of 12 zeros is created, and the identified block is placed at the calculated new indices. Indices outside the original block's location are filled with zeros.\n\n## YAML Fact Document\n\n"
