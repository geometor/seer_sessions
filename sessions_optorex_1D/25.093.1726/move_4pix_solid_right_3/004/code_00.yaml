task_description: Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers 4 positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence.
task_elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - contains_zeros: true (as background/filler)
      - contains_non_zero_block: true (exactly one block per sequence)
  - name: zero
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: background_element
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - contiguity: true (elements are adjacent)
      - uniformity: all elements within the block are identical and non-zero
      - variable_length: true (observed lengths: 1, 2, 3, 4)
      - variable_value: true (observed values: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9)
      - variable_position: true (block can start at various indices)
      - single_occurrence: true (only one such block exists in the input sequence)
actions:
  - name: find_non_zero_block
    input: input_sequence (list_of_integers)
    output: block_details (value, start_index, end_index)
    description: Identify the first non-zero element to find the block's value and start index. Iterate subsequent elements until the value changes or the sequence ends to find the end index.
  - name: calculate_new_position
    input: block_details (start_index, end_index)
    parameter: shift_amount (integer)
    output: new_start_index, new_end_index
    description: Add the shift_amount to the original start and end indices.
  - name: construct_output_sequence
    input: sequence_length (integer), block_details (value), new_start_index, new_end_index
    output: output_sequence (list_of_integers)
    description: Create a new sequence of zeros with the specified length. Place the block's value at the indices from new_start_index (inclusive) to new_end_index (exclusive).
relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    element: non_zero_block
    detail: The block in the output sequence starts exactly 'shift_amount' positions later than the block in the input sequence. The length and value of the block remain unchanged.
  - type: content_preservation
    element: non_zero_block
    detail: The value and length of the non-zero block are preserved from input to output.
  - type: background_filling
    detail: Positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.
constants:
  - name: sequence_length
    value: 12
  - name: shift_distance
    value: 4
    direction: right (positive index change)
