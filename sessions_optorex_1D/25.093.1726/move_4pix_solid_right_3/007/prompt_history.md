*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
    *   The sequences primarily contain the integer 0.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
    *   The transformation involves moving this non-zero block within the sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the 12-element input sequence. Note its starting index, ending index, and the value of the integers in the block.
    2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 4 to the original starting index found in step 1.
    4.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 4 to the original ending index found in step 1.
    5.  Place the identified non-zero block (using the value from step 1) into the output sequence starting at the new starting index and ending at the new ending index calculated in steps 3 and 4.
    6.  Return the modified output sequence.

## Example 1:
Error: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code attempts to solve the task by identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers in a 1D NumPy array and shifting this block 4 positions to the right in a new list initialized with zeros. The core logic (identifying the block and shifting it by 4) appears correct based on the examples.
    The error `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars` occurring consistently across all examples strongly suggests an issue with how NumPy data types are being handled, likely when comparing a NumPy array element to a Python scalar or when attempting to cast a NumPy type (like `np.int64`) to a standard Python `int` using `int()`, especially if the value being cast isn't a single scalar element as expected. The error might stem from the `find_block` function returning a value that isn't a simple scalar, or the `transform` function mishandling this returned value (specifically `block_value`) during the assignment `output_list[i] = int(block_value)`.
    The strategy is to ensure that the block's value is correctly extracted as a Python scalar type before it's used in comparisons or assignments within the `transform` function. Using the `.item()` method on the NumPy array element when retrieving the block's value in `find_block` is a robust way to achieve this.

    **Findings:**
    *   All inputs are 1D sequences of length 12.
    *   All outputs are 1D sequences of length 12.
    *   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
    *   The non-zero value, block length, and start/end indices vary.
    *   The transformation consistently involves shifting the identified block exactly 4 positions to the right.
    *   The block's value and length are preserved in the output.
    *   The output sequence is initialized with zeros, and only the positions corresponding to the shifted block are filled with the block's value.
    *   The error occurred in all examples, indicating a systematic issue in the code's handling of data types rather than an issue specific to certain input patterns.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive a 12-element input sequence (as a 1D NumPy array) containing a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers, with the remaining elements being zero.
    2.  Identify this non-zero block. Determine its integer value, its starting index (inclusive), and its ending index (exclusive). Ensure the value is stored as a standard Python integer.
    3.  Create a new output list of 12 elements, initialized entirely with zeros.
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 4 to its original starting index.
    5.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 4 to its original ending index.
    6.  Iterate from the new starting index up to (but not including) the new ending index. For each index in this range:
        a.  Check if the index is within the valid bounds of the output list (0 to 11).
        b.  If it is within bounds, set the element at that index in the output list to the integer value of the block identified in step 2.
    7.  Return the completed 12-element output list.
