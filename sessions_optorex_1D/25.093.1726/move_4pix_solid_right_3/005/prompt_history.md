*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
    *   The sequences primarily contain the integer 0.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
    *   The transformation involves moving this non-zero block within the sequence.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The core issue identified across all examples is a runtime error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This typically occurs in NumPy when a condition expects a single boolean value (e.g., in an `if` statement) but receives an array of booleans. Reviewing the provided Python code (specifically `find_block_np`), the complex verification logic involving `np.array_equal` and `np.all` combined with boolean array indexing (`&` operator) seems the most likely source, although the exact line causing the error isn't specified in the results.

The underlying transformation logic observed in the first example (identify a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shift it 4 positions to the right) appears consistent across all training examples when comparing inputs and outputs manually.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Block Detection and Shift:** Use code execution to confirm the start index, end index, and value of the non-zero block for each input, and calculate the expected output based on a fixed rightward shift of 4 positions.
2.  **Simplify Implementation:** Refine the `find_block_np` function to remove the potentially problematic complex verification logic, relying on a simpler iteration method, given the problem constraint seems to be a single, contiguous, uniform non-zero block.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the confirmed transformation rule and the simplified, robust method for achieving it. The core rule (shift block right by 4) remains unchanged, but the description of *how* to find the block will be simplified.

## Metrics and Verification

Let's verify the block properties and the shift calculation for each training example.

All calculated outputs match expected outputs: True

Detailed comparison for Example 1:
Input:             [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Expected Output:   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]
Calculated Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, np.int64(2), np.int64(2), 0, 0, 0]

Detailed comparison for Example 7:
Input:             [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Expected Output:   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Calculated Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, np.int64(1), 0]

```
The verification confirms:
1.  The simplified block-finding logic correctly identifies the non-zero block (value, start, end) in all training examples.
2.  Applying a shift of +4 to the start and end indices correctly predicts the position of the block in the output.
3.  Constructing the output sequence based on these shifted indices matches the expected output for all training examples.
4.  The error encountered previously was likely due to the implementation details of the original `find_block_np` function, not the core transformation rule. The simplified version avoids the error and produces correct results.
5. Note: The calculated output contains `np.int64` types, while the expected output contains standard Python `int` types. This difference in type might be relevant depending on the exact requirements of the task environment, but the values themselves match. The final function should ensure it returns standard Python lists with standard integers if required.

relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    element: non_zero_block
    detail: The block in the output sequence starts exactly 'shift_amount' positions later than the block in the input sequence. The length and value of the block remain unchanged.

    element: non_zero_block
    detail: The value and length of the non-zero block are preserved from input to output.
  - type: background_filling
    detail: Positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.

  - name: sequence_length
    value: 12
  - name: shift_distance
    value: 4
    direction: right (positive index change)

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new output sequence containing 12 zeros.
2.  **Locate Block:** Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the `start_index` and determines the `value` of the block.
3.  **Determine Block End:** Continue scanning from the `start_index` until either the sequence ends or an element is encountered that is different from the block `value`. The index of this first differing element (or the length of the sequence if the block extends to the end) marks the `end_index` (exclusive) of the block.
4.  **Calculate New Position:** Compute the `new_start_index` by adding 4 to the original `start_index`. Compute the `new_end_index` by adding 4 to the original `end_index`.
5.  **Populate Output:** Fill the elements of the output sequence from the `new_start_index` (inclusive) up to, but not including, the `new_end_index` with the identified block `value`. Ensure indices stay within the bounds (0 to 11) of the output sequence.
6.  **Return:** Return the completed output sequence.
