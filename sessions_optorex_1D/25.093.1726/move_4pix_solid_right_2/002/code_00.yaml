objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence
    properties:
      - elements: identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous: true
      - uniqueness: Exactly one such block exists in the input sequence.
      - location: Defined by start_index and end_index (or length).
      - length: Variable (1 or more)
  - name: zero_elements
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: background/padding

parameters:
  - name: shift_distance
    type: integer
    value: 4
  - name: shift_direction
    type: string
    value: "right" # Corresponds to increasing the index
  - name: sequence_length
    type: integer
    value: 12

actions:
  - name: find_block
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence (list of 12 integers)
    output: block_value (integer), start_index (integer), block_length (integer)
    description: Identify the value, starting position (0-based index), and length of the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. Returns default values (e.g., None, -1, 0) if no such block exists.
  - name: create_output_sequence
    actor: system
    input: sequence_length
    output: output_sequence (list of 12 integers, all zeros)
    description: Initialize a new list of the specified length, filled with zeros.
  - name: place_shifted_block
    actor: system
    input:
      - output_sequence
      - block_value
      - original_start_index
      - block_length
      - shift_distance
      - sequence_length
    output: modified_output_sequence
    description: Calculate the new_start_index (original_start_index + shift_distance). Populate the output_sequence with the block_value for block_length positions starting from new_start_index, ensuring indices stay within the sequence bounds (0 to sequence_length - 1).

relationships:
  - type: positional_shift
    subject: non_zero_block
    details: The starting index of the block in the output sequence is exactly 4 greater than its starting index in the input sequence.
  - type: content_preservation
    subject: non_zero_block
    details: The numerical value of the digits and the length (number of digits) of the block remain unchanged between input and output.
  - type: structure_preservation
    subject: sequence
    details: The overall length of the sequence (12 elements) is preserved. Elements not part of the shifted block are zeros.
