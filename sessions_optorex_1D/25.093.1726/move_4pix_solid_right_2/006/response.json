            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe error message `setting an array element with a sequence... inhomogeneous shape... detected shape was (1, 12) + inhomogeneous part` consistently appears across all examples. This strongly suggests the `transform` function is receiving input data in a format it doesn't fully expect, specifically a 2D array-like structure (e.g., a list containing a single list `[[...]]` or a 2D numpy array `np.array([[...]])`) instead of the anticipated 1D list `[...]`.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (find a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift it 4 positions right) appears correct based on visually comparing the input/output pairs. The failure is not in the understanding of the transformation rule itself, but likely in the initial handling and type/shape validation of the input data structure provided by the execution environment.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the `transform` function to robustly handle potential input variations:\n1.  Detect if the input is a nested list (e.g., `[[0, 9, ...]]`) or a 2D numpy array (shape `(1, 12)`).\n2.  If nested or 2D, extract the inner 1D sequence.\n3.  Ensure the resulting sequence is a 1D list of length 12.\n4.  Apply the established block-finding and shifting logic to this standardized 1D list.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe consistent error across all 7 training examples and the single test example reinforces the hypothesis of a systematic input format mismatch.\n\n| Example | Input Block Value | Input Start Index | Input Block Length | Expected Output Start Index | Shift Distance | Consistent? | Error Type                  |\n| :------ | :---------------- | :---------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------- | :------------- | :---------- | :-------------------------- |\n| train_1 | 9                 | 1                 | 3                  | 5                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |\n| train_2 | 5                 | 5                 | 2                  | 9                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |\n| train_3 | 1                 | 2                 | 1                  | 6                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |\n| train_4 | 4                 | 5                 | 1                  | 9                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |\n| train_5 | 6                 | 5                 | 3                  | 9                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |\n| train_6 | 2                 | 3                 | 1                  | 7                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |\n| train_7 | 4                 | 1                 | 5                  | 5                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |\n| test_1  | (Error prevents analysis) | -             | -                  | -                           | -              | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |\n\n**Observations:**\n*   The shift distance is consistently +4 for all verifiable training examples.\n*   The block identification logic (contiguous, identical, non-zero) holds for all training examples.\n*   The error type is identical for all examples, pointing to the input format as the primary issue.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
