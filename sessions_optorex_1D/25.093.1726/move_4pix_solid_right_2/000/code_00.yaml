objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence
    properties:
      - elements: identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous: true
      - location: variable within the input sequence
      - length: variable (1 or more)
  - name: zero_elements
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: padding/background

actions:
  - name: identify_block
    actor: system
    input: input sequence
    output: non_zero_block (value, start_index, end_index)
  - name: shift_block
    actor: system
    object: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - direction: right
      - distance: 4 positions
  - name: generate_output
    actor: system
    input:
      - input sequence
      - identified non_zero_block
      - shift parameters (direction=right, distance=4)
    output: output sequence
    process: Create a new sequence of the same length filled with zeros, then place the non_zero_block at the new shifted position.

relationships:
  - type: positional_change
    subject: non_zero_block
    details: The start and end indices of the non_zero_block increase by 4 from input to output.
  - type: value_preservation
    subject: non_zero_block
    details: The digits and length of the non_zero_block remain the same between input and output.
  - type: structure_preservation
    subject: sequence
    details: The length of the sequence (12) remains the same between input and output.
