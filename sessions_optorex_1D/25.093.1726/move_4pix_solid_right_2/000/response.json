The sequence is characterized by containing mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The length of this non-zero block varies across examples.\n\nThe output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit integers. It retains the same non-zero digits and the same number of zeros as the input. The key difference is the position of the non-zero block.\n\nThe transformation involves identifying the contiguous block of non-zero digits in the input sequence and shifting this entire block exactly 4 positions to the right. The positions originally occupied by the block become zeros, and the positions where the block moves to adopt the non-zero digit values. All other zero positions remain unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
