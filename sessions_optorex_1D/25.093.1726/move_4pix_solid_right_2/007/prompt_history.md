## Perception

The input consists of a sequence of 12 single-digit integers. The sequence is characterized by containing mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. The length of this non-zero block varies across examples.

The output is also a sequence of 12 single-digit integers. It retains the same non-zero digits and the same number of zeros as the input. The key difference is the position of the non-zero block.

The transformation involves identifying the contiguous block of non-zero digits in the input sequence and shifting this entire block exactly 4 positions to the right. The positions originally occupied by the block become zeros, and the positions where the block moves to adopt the non-zero digit values. All other zero positions remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous sub-sequence composed of identical non-zero digits (the "block"). Record the value of the digit, the starting index, and the ending index of this block.
3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initially filled with zeros.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 4 to the original starting index.
5.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 4 to the original ending index.
6.  Place the identified block (using its original digit value and length) into the output sequence starting at the new starting index and ending at the new ending index.
7.  Return the resulting output sequence.

## General Assessment

The error message `setting an array element with a sequence... inhomogeneous shape... detected shape was (1, 12) + inhomogeneous part` consistently appears across all examples. This strongly suggests the `transform` function is receiving input data in a format it doesn't fully expect, specifically a 2D array-like structure (e.g., a list containing a single list `[[...]]` or a 2D numpy array `np.array([[...]])`) instead of the anticipated 1D list `[...]`.

The core transformation logic identified previously (find a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift it 4 positions right) appears correct based on visually comparing the input/output pairs. The failure is not in the understanding of the transformation rule itself, but likely in the initial handling and type/shape validation of the input data structure provided by the execution environment.

The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to robustly handle potential input variations:
1.  Detect if the input is a nested list (e.g., `[[0, 9, ...]]`) or a 2D numpy array (shape `(1, 12)`).
2.  If nested or 2D, extract the inner 1D sequence.
3.  Ensure the resulting sequence is a 1D list of length 12.
4.  Apply the established block-finding and shifting logic to this standardized 1D list.

## Metrics

The consistent error across all 7 training examples and the single test example reinforces the hypothesis of a systematic input format mismatch.

| train_4 | 4                 | 5                 | 1                  | 9                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |

| train_7 | 4                 | 1                 | 5                  | 5                           | +4             | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |
| test_1  | (Error prevents analysis) | -             | -                  | -                           | -              | Yes         | Inhomogeneous shape (1, 12) |

**Observations:**
*   The shift distance is consistently +4 for all verifiable training examples.
*   The block identification logic (contiguous, identical, non-zero) holds for all training examples.
*   The error type is identical for all examples, pointing to the input format as the primary issue.

  - type: structure_preservation
    subject: sequence
    details: The length of the core data sequence (12) is preserved from the standardized input to the output. The output is always a 1D list.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input, which might be a 1D sequence of 12 integers, a list containing one such sequence, or a 2D numpy array containing one such sequence as its single row.
2.  Standardize the input: Extract the core 1D sequence of 12 integers (the `data_sequence`). If the input does not conform to one of the expected structures or the extracted sequence length is not 12, handle as an error.
3.  Identify the contiguous sub-sequence within the `data_sequence` composed of identical non-zero digits (the "block"). Record the value of the digit, the starting index, and the length of this block. If no such block exists, proceed to step 6.
4.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initially filled with zeros.
5.  If a block was found in step 3:
    a.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 4 to the original starting index found in the `data_sequence`.
    b.  Place the identified block (using its recorded digit value and length) into the output sequence starting at the calculated new starting index. Ensure placement stays within the bounds (indices 0-11) of the output sequence.
6.  Return the resulting output sequence (which will be all zeros if no block was found in the input).
