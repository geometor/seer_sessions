objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: 1D array-like structure (e.g., list or NumPy array)
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: output_sequence
    type: 1D list # The desired output format is typically a standard list
    properties:
      - length: 12
      - elements: single-digit integers (0-9)
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence
    properties:
      - elements: identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous: true
      - uniqueness: Only one such block exists per input sequence.
      - location: variable within the input sequence
      - length: variable (1 or more)
  - name: zero_elements
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: background/padding

actions:
  - name: receive_input
    actor: system
    input: 1D array-like structure
    output: internal representation (potentially convert to standard list)
  - name: identify_block
    actor: system
    input: internal sequence representation
    output: block_value (integer), start_index (integer), block_length (integer)
    process: Iterate through the sequence to find the first non-zero element. Record its value and start index. Continue iterating while subsequent elements match the block value to determine the length. Stop after the first block is fully identified.
  - name: initialize_output
    actor: system
    output: 1D list of length 12, filled with zeros.
  - name: calculate_new_position
    actor: system
    input: original_start_index
    properties:
      - shift_distance: 4
      - direction: right
    output: new_start_index
  - name: place_block
    actor: system
    input:
      - output_sequence (initialized)
      - block_value
      - new_start_index
      - block_length
    output: output_sequence (modified)
    process: Populate the elements of the output sequence from `new_start_index` up to `new_start_index + block_length - 1` with the `block_value`. Ensure operations stay within the sequence bounds (length 12).
  - name: return_output
    actor: system
    output: final 1D list

relationships:
  - type: positional_change
    subject: non_zero_block
    details: The start index of the block increases by exactly 4 positions from input to output.
  - type: value_preservation
    subject: non_zero_block
    details: The digit value and length of the non_zero_block remain the same.
  - type: structure_preservation
    subject: sequence
    details: The length of the sequence (12) and the count of non-zero elements remain the same.
