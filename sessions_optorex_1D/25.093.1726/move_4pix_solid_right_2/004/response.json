            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the previously defined natural language program. The core logic involves identifying a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 4 positions to the right within a 12-element sequence.\n\nHowever, the code failed execution on all examples, producing the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the testing environment provides the input not as a standard Python list of integers (as assumed by the code's direct comparison `input_list[i] != 0`), but as a NumPy array or a similar structure. When `input_list[i]` is compared to `0`, the result might be an array of booleans if `input_list[i]` itself is array-like, leading to the ambiguity error in standard Python boolean contexts (like `if`).\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to ensure the implementation correctly handles the input data type, likely by explicitly converting the input to a standard Python list at the beginning of the `transform` function or by using NumPy-aware comparison methods if sticking with NumPy arrays. The underlying transformation logic (find block, shift right by 4) appears correct based on the examples and the initial analysis.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe execution results indicate a consistent failure across all 7 training examples and the single test example provided.\n\n*   **Success Rate:** 0/8 examples passed.\n*   **Failure Type:** Consistent `ValueError` (\"The truth value of an array...\") across all examples.\n*   **Cause:** Input data type mismatch. The code expects a standard list allowing direct element comparison (`element != 0`), but receives an array-like object where such comparison yields ambiguous results in an `if` statement context.\n*   **Input Structure:** All inputs are 1D sequences of length 12.\n*   **Transformation Rule Consistency:** The rule of finding a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it right by 4 positions seems consistent across all examples.\n\nNo further code execution is needed to gather metrics, as the error source is identified. The task is to refine the description and program to guide the coder towards handling the input type correctly.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
