*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists) of integers.
    *   Each sequence has a fixed length (12 in all examples).
    *   The sequences primarily contain zeros.
    *   Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (this block can be of length 1).
    *   The output sequence is derived from the input by moving this non-zero block.
    *   The movement is a shift to the right by a fixed number of positions.
    *   The positions previously occupied by the non-zero block become zeros in the output.
    *   The amount of the rightward shift appears to be constant across all examples (+4 positions).

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: locate a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers in the input sequence and shift this block 4 positions to the right in the output sequence, filling the original positions with zeros.

The Python code implemented this logic. However, the execution results show a consistent `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` across all examples. This error typically occurs when a multi-element NumPy array is used in a boolean context (like an `if` statement) where a single `True` or `False` is expected.

Based on the traceback and the code structure, the most probable cause is that the input sequence provided to the `transform` function (or internally to `find_non_zero_block`) is not a flat 1D list or array as visually represented in the examples, but rather a nested structure like a list containing a list (`[[0, 0, ...]]`) or a 2D NumPy array (`np.array([[0, 0, ...]])`). When the code iterates through such a structure, `val` in `find_non_zero_block` becomes a list or array, leading to the ambiguous truth value error during comparisons like `val != 0`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly check if the input is nested (e.g., a list of lists or a 2D array with one row) and extract the actual 1D sequence before processing.
2.  **Code Refinement:** Ensure the `find_non_zero_block` function operates correctly on the extracted 1D sequence.
3.  **Verification:** Use `tool_code` to gather metrics confirming the sequence length, block properties, and the constant shift amount (+4) across all training examples.
4.  **Documentation Update:** Refine the YAML documentation and Natural Language Program to reflect the identified pattern and the input handling requirement.

## Metrics and Verification

The following code analyzes the provided training examples to confirm the properties of the sequences and the transformation rule.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Input Handling:** Receive the input sequence. Check if it's a nested list (e.g., `[[a, b, c]]`) or a 2D array with one row. If so, extract the inner 1D sequence; otherwise, use the input directly as the sequence to process. Let the length of this 1D sequence be `N`.
2.  **Initialization:** Create a new list (the output sequence) of length `N`, filled entirely with zeros.
3.  **Locate Block:** Iterate through the 1D input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-zero number. Once found, record this number as the `block_value` and its index as the `start_index`. Continue iterating from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of identical `block_value` numbers. Determine the `block_length`.
4.  **Calculate New Position:** Compute the `new_start_index` for the block in the output sequence by adding 4 to the `start_index` found in the input.
5.  **Place Block:** Copy the `block_value` into the output sequence `block_length` times, starting from the `new_start_index`. Ensure that writing the block does not go beyond the bounds of the output sequence (indices 0 to `N-1`).
6.  **Return Output:** Return the generated output sequence.
