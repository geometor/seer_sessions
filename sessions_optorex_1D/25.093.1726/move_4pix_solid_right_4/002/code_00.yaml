task_description: Transform a 1D sequence by finding the first contiguous block of identical non-zero integers and shifting it 4 positions to the right.
input_schema:
  type: sequence
  description: A 1D sequence (list or NumPy array) of integers. May occasionally be nested within an outer list or 2D array (e.g., [[...]] or np.array([[...]])).
  properties:
    length: Fixed (12 in examples).
    content: Primarily zeros, containing exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
    zero_value: 0
output_schema:
  type: sequence
  description: A 1D list of integers representing the transformed sequence.
  properties:
    length: Same as input length (12 in examples).
    content: Primarily zeros, with the non-zero block from the input shifted right.
    zero_value: 0
elements:
  - object: sequence
    description: The 1D list of integers being transformed.
  - object: non_zero_block
    description: The contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers found in the input sequence.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer value.
      - start_index: The 0-based starting index in the input sequence.
      - length: The number of elements in the block.
  - object: background_element
    description: The integer 0, filling the sequence outside the non_zero_block.
transformation:
  action: Identify and Shift Block
  steps:
    - step: 1
      description: Check if the input sequence is nested (e.g., `[[...]]` or 2D array) and extract the inner 1D sequence if necessary.
    - step: 2
      description: Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the (flattened) input sequence, filled with the background_element (0).
    - step: 3
      description: Scan the input sequence to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (the non_zero_block). Record its value, start_index, and length.
    - step: 4
      description: Calculate the target start index for the block in the output sequence by adding a fixed shift amount (4) to the input start_index.
    - step: 5
      description: Copy the non_zero_block (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target start index. Ensure the block placement stays within the sequence bounds.
  parameters:
    - shift_amount:
        value: 4
        description: The fixed number of positions to shift the block to the right.
