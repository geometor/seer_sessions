            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The provided code failed consistently across all training and test examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that a boolean comparison intended to evaluate a single condition (e.g., `if element != 0:`) was instead performed on a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values. This typically happens if the variable being checked (e.g., `element`) is unexpectedly an array instead of a scalar value. Given that the `find_contiguous_block` function iterates through the input array, the most likely cause is that the input `data` passed to the function was not a 1D array as assumed by the function's logic. It might have been a 2D array (perhaps the test harness passed the entire set of examples at once), causing the iterator variable `digit` to hold a 1D array (a row) on each iteration, leading to the ambiguous boolean comparison. The core transformation logic (identifying a block and shifting it) appears sound based on the initial examples, but its implementation failed due to this apparent mismatch in data structure assumptions between the function design and the execution environment. The strategy is to reaffirm the assumption that the task operates on individual 1D arrays and ensure the natural language program and facts reflect this, implying the error lies in the execution context rather than the core task logic itself.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Based on the provided examples and the code execution analysis:\n    *   Input/Output Format: Each example pair consists of an input and output sequence represented as space-separated strings of integers. When processed, these form 1D sequences (lists or NumPy arrays).\n    *   Sequence Length: All input and output sequences have a length of 12.\n    *   Data Type: The elements are integers. The sequences primarily contain zeros ('0') and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.\n    *   Block Properties:\n        *   Value: The non-zero digit varies (9, 3, 4, 8, 1).\n        *   Length: The length of the block varies (3, 2, 7, 7, 2, 2, 5).\n        *   Start Index (Input): Varies (3, 6, 1, 0, 6, 4, 2).\n        *   Start Index (Output): Varies (7, 10, 5, 4, 10, 8, 6).\n    *   Transformation: In all examples, the non-zero block from the input appears in the output, shifted 4 positions to the right.\n        *   Example 1: Start 3 -> Start 7 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 2: Start 6 -> Start 10 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 3: Start 1 -> Start 5 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 4: Start 0 -> Start 4 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 5: Start 6 -> Start 10 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 6: Start 4 -> Start 8 (Shift +4)\n        *   Example 7: Start 2 -> Start 6 (Shift +4)\n    *   Error Analysis: The `ValueError` confirms that boolean array comparisons were attempted within scalar `if` statements, suggesting the function received data with unexpected dimensionality during testing. The code logic itself, intended for 1D arrays, seems consistent with the observed +4 shift.\n\n*   **Facts (YAML):**\n    "
