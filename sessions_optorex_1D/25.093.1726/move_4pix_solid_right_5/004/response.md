*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code failed consistently across all training and test examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that a boolean comparison intended to evaluate a single condition (e.g., `if element != 0:`) was instead performed on a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values. This typically happens if the variable being checked (e.g., `element`) is unexpectedly an array instead of a scalar value. Given that the `find_contiguous_block` function iterates through the input array, the most likely cause is that the input `data` passed to the function was not a 1D array as assumed by the function's logic. It might have been a 2D array (perhaps the test harness passed the entire set of examples at once), causing the iterator variable `digit` to hold a 1D array (a row) on each iteration, leading to the ambiguous boolean comparison. The core transformation logic (identifying a block and shifting it) appears sound based on the initial examples, but its implementation failed due to this apparent mismatch in data structure assumptions between the function design and the execution environment. The strategy is to reaffirm the assumption that the task operates on individual 1D arrays and ensure the natural language program and facts reflect this, implying the error lies in the execution context rather than the core task logic itself.

*   **Metrics:**
    Based on the provided examples and the code execution analysis:
    *   Input/Output Format: Each example pair consists of an input and output sequence represented as space-separated strings of integers. When processed, these form 1D sequences (lists or NumPy arrays).
    *   Sequence Length: All input and output sequences have a length of 12.
    *   Data Type: The elements are integers. The sequences primarily contain zeros ('0') and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
    *   Block Properties:
        *   Value: The non-zero digit varies (9, 3, 4, 8, 1).
        *   Length: The length of the block varies (3, 2, 7, 7, 2, 2, 5).
        *   Start Index (Input): Varies (3, 6, 1, 0, 6, 4, 2).
        *   Start Index (Output): Varies (7, 10, 5, 4, 10, 8, 6).
    *   Transformation: In all examples, the non-zero block from the input appears in the output, shifted 4 positions to the right.
        *   Example 1: Start 3 -> Start 7 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 2: Start 6 -> Start 10 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 3: Start 1 -> Start 5 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 4: Start 0 -> Start 4 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 5: Start 6 -> Start 10 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 6: Start 4 -> Start 8 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 7: Start 2 -> Start 6 (Shift +4)
    *   Error Analysis: The `ValueError` confirms that boolean array comparisons were attempted within scalar `if` statements, suggesting the function received data with unexpected dimensionality during testing. The code logic itself, intended for 1D arrays, seems consistent with the observed +4 shift.

      properties:
        length: 12
        elements:
          type: integers
          composition: Primarily zeros, containing the same contiguous block as the input but shifted.

          value: Same as input block value
          length: Same as input block length
          start_index: Input block start_index + 4
    transformation:
      action: Identify and Shift Block
      object: Contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence.
      details:
        - Find the start index, length, and value of the non-zero block.
        - Create a new sequence of length 12, initialized with zeros.
        - Calculate the target start index by adding 4 to the original start index.
        - Place the identified block into the new sequence at the target start index.
      constraints: Assumes exactly one such block exists in the input. Assumes the input is a 1D sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive a single input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-zero integer. This marks the potential start of the block. Record its value and starting index.
    4.  Continue iterating from the start index to determine the length of the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits matching the recorded value.
    5.  If a valid block (non-zero value, positive length) is found:
        a.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding 4 to the block's starting index found in the input sequence.
        b.  Copy the block (using its original value and determined length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target index. Ensure copying respects the bounds of the 12-element output sequence (though observed examples don't exceed bounds).
    6.  Return the new output sequence.
