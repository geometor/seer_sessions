*   **Perception:** The input and output are one-dimensional sequences (lists or arrays) of integers, all having the same length (12 elements). Each input sequence consists mostly of zeros ('0') and one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., '9 9 9', '3 3', '4 4 4 4 4 4 4'). The output sequence contains the same block of non-zero digits, but shifted to a different position within the sequence, with the remaining positions filled with zeros. The key transformation is the relocation of this non-zero block. By comparing the starting index of the block in the input and output, it appears the block is consistently shifted 4 positions to the right.

    1.  Identify the contiguous sub-sequence within the input list consisting of identical non-zero digits (the "block"). Note its starting index, length, and the value of the digit.
    2.  Create a new list of the same length as the input list, initialized entirely with zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 4 to its original starting index in the input list.
    4.  Place the identified block (using its original digit value and length) into the new list, starting at the calculated new starting index.
    5.  The resulting list is the output.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code failed consistently across all training and test examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that a boolean comparison intended to evaluate a single condition (e.g., `if element != 0:`) was instead performed on a NumPy array containing multiple boolean values. This typically happens if the variable being checked (e.g., `element`) is unexpectedly an array instead of a scalar value. Given that the `find_contiguous_block` function iterates through the input array, the most likely cause is that the input `data` passed to the function was not a 1D array as assumed by the function's logic. It might have been a 2D array (perhaps the test harness passed the entire set of examples at once), causing the iterator variable `digit` to hold a 1D array (a row) on each iteration, leading to the ambiguous boolean comparison. The core transformation logic (identifying a block and shifting it) appears sound based on the initial examples, but its implementation failed due to this apparent mismatch in data structure assumptions between the function design and the execution environment. The strategy is to reaffirm the assumption that the task operates on individual 1D arrays and ensure the natural language program and facts reflect this, implying the error lies in the execution context rather than the core task logic itself.

*   **Metrics:**
    Based on the provided examples and the code execution analysis:
    *   Input/Output Format: Each example pair consists of an input and output sequence represented as space-separated strings of integers. When processed, these form 1D sequences (lists or NumPy arrays).
    *   Sequence Length: All input and output sequences have a length of 12.
    *   Data Type: The elements are integers. The sequences primarily contain zeros ('0') and a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
    *   Block Properties:
        *   Value: The non-zero digit varies (9, 3, 4, 8, 1).
        *   Length: The length of the block varies (3, 2, 7, 7, 2, 2, 5).
        *   Start Index (Input): Varies (3, 6, 1, 0, 6, 4, 2).
        *   Start Index (Output): Varies (7, 10, 5, 4, 10, 8, 6).
    *   Transformation: In all examples, the non-zero block from the input appears in the output, shifted 4 positions to the right.
        *   Example 1: Start 3 -> Start 7 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 2: Start 6 -> Start 10 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 3: Start 1 -> Start 5 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 4: Start 0 -> Start 4 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 5: Start 6 -> Start 10 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 6: Start 4 -> Start 8 (Shift +4)
        *   Example 7: Start 2 -> Start 6 (Shift +4)
    *   Error Analysis: The `ValueError` confirms that boolean array comparisons were attempted within scalar `if` statements, suggesting the function received data with unexpected dimensionality during testing. The code logic itself, intended for 1D arrays, seems consistent with the observed +4 shift.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive a single input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-zero integer. This marks the potential start of the block. Record its value and starting index.
    4.  Continue iterating from the start index to determine the length of the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits matching the recorded value.
    5.  If a valid block (non-zero value, positive length) is found:
        a.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by adding 4 to the block's starting index found in the input sequence.
        b.  Copy the block (using its original value and determined length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target index. Ensure copying respects the bounds of the 12-element output sequence (though observed examples don't exceed bounds).
    6.  Return the new output sequence.
