Each input sequence consists mostly of zeros ('0') and one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., '9 9 9', '3 3', '4 4 4 4 4 4 4'). The output sequence contains the same block of non-zero digits, but shifted to a different position within the sequence, with the remaining positions filled with zeros. The key transformation is the relocation of this non-zero block. By comparing the starting index of the block in the input and output, it appears the block is consistently shifted 4 positions to the right.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
