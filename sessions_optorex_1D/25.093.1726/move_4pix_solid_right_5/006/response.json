            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided information consists of seven input-output examples of a sequence transformation task and the results of executing a Python script intended to perform this transformation. The script failed on all examples with the same error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.\n\nThis error typically occurs in Python code, especially when using libraries like NumPy, when a boolean condition expects a single `True` or `False` value but receives an array of boolean values instead (e.g., `if numpy_array == value:` where `numpy_array` has multiple elements).\n\nThe core transformation observed across all examples is consistent: a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a sequence of 12 integers is shifted exactly 4 positions to the right. The block's content (digit value and length) remains unchanged. All other positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.\n\nThe previous code attempted to implement this logic by:\n1.  Finding the start index, length, and value of the non-zero block.\n2.  Creating a zero-filled output array.\n3.  Placing the block at the new start index (original start index + 4).\n\nThe failure suggests an issue within the `find_contiguous_block` function, specifically in the conditional logic (`if not in_block and current_digit != 0:` or `if current_digit == value:`). Although the code attempted to extract scalar values using `.item()`, the error persists, possibly due to unexpected input data structure subtleties in the execution environment or how NumPy handles comparisons in that context.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Re-affirm the core transformation logic based on the consistent pattern observed in all examples.\n2.  Update the factual documentation (YAML) and the natural language program to accurately reflect this understanding.\n3.  Advise the Coder phase to focus on a robust implementation of the block-finding and shifting logic, paying particular attention to NumPy array comparisons and data types to avoid the previously encountered `ValueError`. The conceptual logic of the previous attempt seems correct, but the implementation details need refinement.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nBased on manual analysis of the examples, as code execution failed:\n\n| Example | Input Length | Output Length | Block Value | Block Length | Input Start Index | Output Start Index | Calculated Shift |\n| :------ | :----------- | :------------ | :---------- | :----------- | :---------------- | :----------------- | :--------------- |\n| train_1 | 12           | 12            | 9           | 3            | 3                 | 7                  | +4               |\n| train_2 | 12           | 12            | 3           | 2            | 6                 | 10                 | +4               |\n| train_3 | 12           | 12            | 4           | 7            | 1                 | 5                  | +4               |\n| train_4 | 12           | 12            | 3           | 7            | 0                 | 4                  | +4               |\n| train_5 | 12           | 12            | 8           | 2            | 6                 | 10                 | +4               |\n| train_6 | 12           | 12            | 1           | 2            | 4                 | 8                  | +4               |\n| train_7 | 12           | 12            | 8           | 5            | 2                 | 6                  | +4               |\n\n**Conclusion from Metrics:** The transformation consistently involves shifting the identified block 4 positions to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
