Data:
  Type: Sequence (List or 1D Array) of Integers
  Structure: Linear, fixed length (12 in examples)
  Content: Primarily zeros, with one segment of non-zero integers.

Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Representation: Integer 0
    Role: Fills space outside the pattern.
  - Name: Pattern
    Representation: The single contiguous sequence of one or more non-zero integers.
    Properties:
      - Values: The specific non-zero integers (e.g., [7, 7], [2, 2, 2]). Order is preserved.
      - Length: The number of integers in the pattern (variable).
      - Input Position: Defined by the start and end indices in the input sequence.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per sequence.

Action:
  Name: Translate Right
  Target: The Pattern object.
  Parameter:
    - Name: Distance
      Value: 4 positions
      Type: Constant Integer
  Effect:
    - The Pattern's starting index in the output sequence is exactly 4 greater than its starting index in the input sequence.
    - The original spatial extent occupied by the Pattern in the input is filled with the Background value (0) in the output, unless overwritten by the shifted pattern itself (which doesn't happen with a right shift into zero space).
    - The relative order and values of elements within the Pattern remain unchanged.
    - Elements of the Pattern shifted beyond the sequence boundary are truncated (not wrapped).

Relationships:
  - The Pattern is embedded within the Background in both input and output.
  - The output sequence length is identical to the input sequence length.
  - The transformation solely depends on the Pattern's initial position, its content, and the fixed shift distance.
