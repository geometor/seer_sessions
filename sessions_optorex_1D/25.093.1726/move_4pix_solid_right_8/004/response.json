            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code aimed to implement a transformation rule identified as \"shift the non-zero block 4 positions to the right\". However, the execution results show that the code consistently produced an all-zero output for every input example, failing to match any expected output.\n\nThe analysis of the input/output examples confirms that the transformation rule consistently involves:\n1.  Identifying the single contiguous block of non-zero integers in the input sequence.\n2.  Shifting this entire block exactly 4 positions to the right to produce the output sequence.\n3.  Filling all other positions in the output sequence with zeros.\n\nThe provided Python code, particularly the `transform` function using NumPy, appears logically sound and correctly implements this \"shift right by 4\" rule based on a step-by-step trace. The discrepancy between the code's logic and the reported execution results (all zeros) is significant. This suggests a potential issue external to the core algorithm logic itself, such as:\n*   An error in how the input data was parsed or passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment (e.g., passing strings instead of integers, incorrect dimensions).\n*   An unexpected behavior or state within the specific Python/NumPy execution environment where the tests were run.\n*   The possibility that the code *actually* executed was different from the code provided in the prompt history.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe strategy is to refine the understanding and documentation of the task based *on the examples*, assuming the \"shift right by 4\" rule is correct. The failure of the previous code execution will be noted, but the core perceived logic will be maintained as it aligns perfectly with the data. The Natural Language Program and YAML facts will be updated for clarity and precision based on this rule.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nThe following metrics were derived from analyzing the input/output pairs:\n\n"
