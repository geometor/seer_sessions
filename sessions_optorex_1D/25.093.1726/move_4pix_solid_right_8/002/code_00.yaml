Data:
  Type: NumPy Array (1-dimensional)
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Elements: Integers (np.int64 based on metrics output)

Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Representation: Integer 0
    Role: Fills empty space in the array.
  - Name: Pattern
    Representation: Contiguous sequence (sub-array) of non-zero integers.
    Properties:
      - Values: The specific non-zero integers making up the pattern.
      - Length: The number of elements in the pattern sub-array.
      - Position: The starting index of the pattern in the input array.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input array.

Action:
  Name: Shift Right
  Target: The Pattern object
  Parameter:
    - Name: Shift Distance
      Value: 4 positions (indices)
  Result:
    - A new NumPy array of the same size is created, initialized with the Background value (0).
    - The Pattern object (sub-array) is copied from the input array.
    - The Pattern is placed into the new array starting at an index equal to its original start index plus the Shift Distance (4).
    - The values and length of the Pattern are preserved in the output array.
    - If the shifted pattern would extend beyond the array boundary, only the part that fits within the boundary is placed. (Note: This condition wasn't explicitly tested by the examples, but is standard behavior for array slicing assignment).

Relationships:
  - The Pattern is embedded within the Background in both input and output arrays.
  - The output array preserves the length, the Pattern's content and length, and the Background representation, but the Pattern's start position is altered by a fixed offset (+4) relative to the input.
