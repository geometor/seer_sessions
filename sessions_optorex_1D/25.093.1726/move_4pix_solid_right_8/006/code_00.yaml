Data:
  Type: Sequence (List) of Integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in all examples)
  Elements: Integers (0 represents background, non-zero represents pattern)

Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Representation: Integer 0
    Role: Fills empty space in the sequence.
  - Name: Pattern
    Representation: A single contiguous sub-sequence of one or more non-zero integers.
    Properties:
      - Values: The specific sequence of non-zero integers.
      - Length: The number of integers in the pattern.
      - Start Index: The 0-based index where the pattern begins in the input sequence.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence (as observed in examples). If no non-zero elements exist, there is no pattern.

Action:
  Name: Shift Right and Truncate
  Target: The Pattern object.
  Parameters:
    - Name: Shift Distance
      Value: Fixed at 4 positions to the right.
  Result:
    - A new sequence of the same length is created, initialized with the Background value (0).
    - The Pattern is copied from the input sequence.
    - The Pattern is placed into the new sequence starting at (Original Start Index + Shift Distance).
    - If placing the Pattern causes it to extend beyond the sequence boundary (index 11), only the part of the Pattern that fits within the boundary is placed. The rest is truncated.
    - If the input sequence contains no Pattern (all zeros), the output sequence remains all zeros.

Relationships:
  - The Pattern is embedded within the Background in both input and output.
  - The output sequence preserves the length and the Background representation.
  - The output Pattern contains the same sequence of values as the input Pattern, potentially truncated if shifted beyond the boundary.
