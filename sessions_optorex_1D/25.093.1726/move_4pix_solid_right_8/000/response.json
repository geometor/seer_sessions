Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of non-zero integers, surrounded by zeros. The zeros appear to represent empty space or a background. The transformation involves relocating the non-zero block within the sequence. The non-zero block itself remains unchanged in terms of the numbers it contains and their order. The surrounding zeros are adjusted to accommodate the moved block.\n\n**YAML Fact Sheet:**\n\n"

The original positions occupied by the Pattern are filled with the Background value (0).\n\nRelationships:\n  - The Pattern is embedded within the Background.\n  - The output sequence preserves the length, the Pattern's content, and the Background representation, but the Pattern's position is altered relative to the input.\n```"
