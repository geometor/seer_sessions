Data:
  Type: Sequence (List) of Integers
  Length: Fixed (12 in examples)
  Elements: Integers, including zero and non-zero values

Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Representation: Integer 0
    Role: Fills empty space in the sequence
  - Name: Pattern
    Representation: Contiguous sequence of non-zero integers
    Properties:
      - Values: The specific non-zero integers making up the pattern.
      - Length: The number of integers in the pattern.
      - Position: The starting index of the pattern in the input sequence.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence.

Action:
  Name: Shift Right
  Target: The Pattern object
  Parameter:
    - Name: Shift Distance
      Value: 4 positions
  Result: The Pattern object is moved 4 positions to the right within the sequence. The original positions occupied by the Pattern are filled with the Background value (0).

Relationships:
  - The Pattern is embedded within the Background.
  - The output sequence preserves the length, the Pattern's content, and the Background representation, but the Pattern's position is altered relative to the input.
