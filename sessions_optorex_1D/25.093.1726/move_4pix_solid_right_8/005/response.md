"""
Identifies a single contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence 
and shifts this block exactly 4 positions to the right within a new sequence of the same size, 
filling all other positions with zeros. If the shifted block extends beyond the sequence boundary, 
it is truncated. If no non-zero block is found, the output is all zeros.
