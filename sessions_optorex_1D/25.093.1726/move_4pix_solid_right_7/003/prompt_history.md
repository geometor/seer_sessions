Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of integers separated by spaces. Each sequence appears to have a fixed length (12 elements in all examples).
2.  **Key Feature:** The sequences primarily consist of zeros ('0') and one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit (e.g., '6', '1', '3', '8', '2', '5').
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the relocation of the non-zero block within the sequence. The non-zero digits themselves and the length of the block remain unchanged. The block is shifted to the right.
4.  **Shift Pattern:** Comparing the start index of the non-zero block in the input and output reveals a consistent rightward shift of 4 positions across all examples.
5.  **Background:** The zeros act as padding or background elements, filling the space where the non-zero block was and being displaced by its new position.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input list. Determine its value, its starting index, and its ending index.
3.  Calculate the new starting index by adding 4 to the original starting index.
4.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 4 to the original ending index.
5.  Create a new list of the same length as the input list, initially filled entirely with zeros.
6.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers into the new list, starting at the calculated new starting index and ending at the calculated new ending index.
7.  Format the new list back into a space-separated string for the output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error message `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` consistently across all examples indicates a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type (string) in the previous `transform` function and the actual input type provided during testing (NumPy array). The core logic of identifying a non-zero block and shifting it seems conceptually correct based on visual inspection, but the implementation failed due to this type mismatch.

The strategy is to:

1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the code to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input, eliminating the string parsing step (`.split()`).
2.  **Verify Transformation Logic:** Confirm the properties observed initially (fixed-length sequence, single non-zero block, constant rightward shift) using code execution on the provided examples. Specifically, verify the shift amount.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and the natural language program to accurately reflect the input type and the confirmed transformation rule.

```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input as a NumPy array of integers.
2.  Determine the length (`N`) of the input array.
3.  Create a new NumPy array of length `N`, initialized with zeros. This will be the output array.
4.  Find the first index (`start_index`) where a non-zero value occurs in the input array.
5.  If no non-zero value is found, return the zero-initialized output array.
6.  Identify the value (`block_value`) of the non-zero element at `start_index`.
7.  Count the number of consecutive elements (`block_length`) starting from `start_index` that are equal to `block_value`.
8.  Calculate the target starting index (`new_start_index`) for the block in the output array by adding 4 to the original `start_index`.
9.  Iterate `block_length` times: for each iteration `i` (from 0 to `block_length - 1`), set the element at index `new_start_index + i` in the output array to `block_value`. Ensure not to write beyond the bounds of the output array.
10. Return the constructed output array.
