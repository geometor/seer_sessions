Each sequence appears to have a fixed length (12 elements in all examples).\n2.  **Key Feature:** The sequences primarily consist of zeros ('0') and one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit (e.g., '6', '1', '3', '8', '2', '5').\n3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the relocation of the non-zero block within the sequence. The non-zero digits themselves and the length of the block remain unchanged. The block is shifted to the right.\n4.  **Shift Pattern:** Comparing the start index of the non-zero block in the input and output reveals a consistent rightward shift of 4 positions across all examples.\n5.  **Background:** The zeros act as padding or background elements, filling the space where the non-zero block was and being displaced by its new position.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
