Okay, analyzing the provided examples:

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of integers separated by spaces. Each sequence appears to have a fixed length (12 elements in all examples).
2.  **Key Feature:** The sequences primarily consist of zeros ('0') and one contiguous block of a single non-zero digit (e.g., '6', '1', '3', '8', '2', '5').
3.  **Transformation:** The core transformation is the relocation of the non-zero block within the sequence. The non-zero digits themselves and the length of the block remain unchanged. The block is shifted to the right.
4.  **Shift Pattern:** Comparing the start index of the non-zero block in the input and output reveals a consistent rightward shift of 4 positions across all examples.
5.  **Background:** The zeros act as padding or background elements, filling the space where the non-zero block was and being displaced by its new position.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input list. Determine its value, its starting index, and its ending index.
3.  Calculate the new starting index by adding 4 to the original starting index.
4.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 4 to the original ending index.
5.  Create a new list of the same length as the input list, initially filled entirely with zeros.
6.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers into the new list, starting at the calculated new starting index and ending at the calculated new ending index.
7.  Format the new list back into a space-separated string for the output.
