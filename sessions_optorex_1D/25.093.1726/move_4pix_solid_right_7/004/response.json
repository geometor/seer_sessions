            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code (`code_00.py`) failed across all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if some_array:`).\n\nAnalysis suggests the error likely stems from the `transform` function receiving the input `input_grid` as a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, 12))`, while the logic within `find_non_zero_block` and subsequent indexing implicitly assumed a 1D array (shape `(12,)`). Operations like comparing elements might then inadvertently compare an element to a slice (an array), triggering the error.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to make the code robust to this potential input format variation. This involves:\n1.  Ensuring the input array is treated as 1D within the core logic, for example, by using `input_grid.flatten()`.\n2.  Modifying the `find_non_zero_block` helper function to work correctly with the potentially flattened 1D array.\n3.  Ensuring the output array is returned in the expected format (likely 1D, based on the problem description).\n\n**Metrics and Analysis**\n\nLet's re-examine `train_1` with the assumption that the input might be 2D `(1, 12)` and applying the flattening strategy:\n\n*   **Input:** `[[0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0]]` (Shape: `(1, 12)`)\n*   **Flattened Input:** `[0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0]` (Shape: `(12,)`)\n*   **Identify Non-Zero Block (on flattened):**\n    *   Value: 6\n    *   Start Index: 1\n    *   Block Length: 5\n*   **Calculate New Start Index:** `1 + 4 = 5`\n*   **Construct Output Array (1D):** Initialize `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n*   **Place Block:** Fill indices 5 through `5 + 5 - 1 = 9` with value 6.\n*   **Resulting 1D Output Array:** `[0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0]` (Shape: `(12,)`)\n\nThis matches the expected output `0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0`. The logic holds for all other examples as they follow the same pattern: find a block, shift right by 4. The flattening ensures the implementation details handle the potential input format ambiguity correctly.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
