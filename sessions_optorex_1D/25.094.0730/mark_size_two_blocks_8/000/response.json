The transformation rule appears to be local, modifying elements based on their neighbors. Specifically, the transformation focuses on identifying sequences of exactly two consecutive '1's. When such a sequence (`1 1`) is found, any '0' immediately preceding it or immediately following it is changed to a '3'. Other elements, including single '1's, sequences of three or more '1's, and '0's not adjacent to a `1 1` sequence, remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
