*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of integers (0s and 1s) into another sequence of integers (0s, 1s, and 3s). The transformation rule appears to be local, modifying elements based on their neighbors. Specifically, the transformation focuses on identifying sequences of exactly two consecutive '1's. When such a sequence (`1 1`) is found, any '0' immediately preceding it or immediately following it is changed to a '3'. Other elements, including single '1's, sequences of three or more '1's, and '0's not adjacent to a `1 1` sequence, remain unchanged.

*   **Facts:**

        output: modified sequence
        description: If a neighbor exists at the checked index and its value is 0, change its value to 3.

    process_flow:
      - Start with a copy of the input_sequence to create the initial output_sequence.
      - Iterate through the input_sequence from the first element up to the second-to-last element.
      - At each position `i`, check if the elements at `input_sequence[i]` and `input_sequence[i+1]` match the target_pattern [1, 1].
      - If the pattern matches:
        - Check the element *before* the pattern: If `i > 0` (an element exists before) and `input_sequence[i-1]` is 0, change the corresponding element in the output_sequence (`output_sequence[i-1]`) to 3.
        - Check the element *after* the pattern: If `i + 2 < length(input_sequence)` (an element exists after) and `input_sequence[i+2]` is 0, change the corresponding element in the output_sequence (`output_sequence[i+2]`) to 3.
      - Ensure that modifications are made to the output_sequence copy, not the input_sequence being iterated over, to avoid affecting subsequent checks within the same pass.
      - Return the final output_sequence.

    constraints:
      - The transformation only applies to sequences of *exactly* two consecutive 1s.
      - Longer sequences of 1s (e.g., `1 1 1`) do not trigger the transformation.
      - Single 1s do not trigger the transformation.
      - Only adjacent 0s are modified. Adjacent 1s or the 1s in the pattern itself are not changed.
      - Modifications happen based on the original input state; a 0 changed to 3 does not affect later checks in the same pass.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the `output_sequence` as a copy of the `input_sequence`.
    2.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` using an index `i` from the start up to the second-to-last element.
    3.  At each index `i`, check if the element at `input_sequence[i]` is 1 and the element at `input_sequence[i+1]` is also 1.
    4.  If this condition (`input_sequence[i] == 1` and `input_sequence[i+1] == 1`) is true:
        a.  Check the element preceding the pattern: If the index `i-1` is valid (i.e., `i > 0`) and the element `input_sequence[i-1]` is 0, update the element at index `i-1` in the `output_sequence` to 3.
        b.  Check the element following the pattern: If the index `i+2` is valid (i.e., `i+2 < length of input_sequence`) and the element `input_sequence[i+2]` is 0, update the element at index `i+2` in the `output_sequence` to 3.
    5.  After iterating through all possible starting positions `i`, return the modified `output_sequence`.

**General Assessment:**

The provided execution results indicate a discrepancy between the expected output and the output generated by the `Previous Code` for training examples 2, 4, and 7. In all failed cases, the `Transformed Output` is identical to the `Input`, suggesting that the code responsible for the transformation (changing `0`s to `3`s) was not executed. However, a manual walkthrough of the `Previous Code` logic against these specific examples (2, 4, and 7) shows that the code *should* produce the `Expected Output`. Furthermore, the `Previous Code` logic correctly handles examples 3 and 5, where `1 1` sequences within a longer run (`1 1 1`) should *not* trigger changes, which aligns with the `Expected Output`.

This leads to the conclusion that the execution results presented likely do not correspond to the execution of the `Previous Code` block shown. The `Previous Code` appears to correctly capture the transformation rule derived from analyzing all examples: *modify 0s adjacent to a `[1, 1]` sequence, but only if that `[1, 1]` sequence is not immediately preceded or followed by another `1`*.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to proceed with the understanding that the logic embedded in the `Previous Code` is correct, as it aligns with all provided input/output pairs when analyzed manually. The Natural Language Program and Facts will be refined to ensure clarity but will retain this core logic. The discrepancy in the execution results will be noted as likely stemming from executing a different or flawed version of the code.

**Metrics:**

Based on manual application of the `Previous Code` logic:

*   **Example 1:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]`, Expected `[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Code Logic Output: `[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Match: Yes.
*   **Example 2:** Input `[0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`, Expected `[0,3,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Code Logic Output: `[0,3,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Match: Yes. (Reported result was incorrect).
*   **Example 3:** Input `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`, Expected `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Code Logic Output: `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Match: Yes.
*   **Example 4:** Input `[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]`, Expected `[0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`. Code Logic Output: `[0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`. Match: Yes. (Reported result was incorrect).
*   **Example 5:** Input `[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`, Expected `[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. Code Logic Output: `[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. Match: Yes.
*   **Example 6:** Input `[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`, Expected `[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. Code Logic Output: `[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. Match: Yes.
*   **Example 7:** Input `[1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0]`, Expected `[1,1,3,0,3,1,1,3,0,0,1,0]`. Code Logic Output: `[1,1,3,0,3,1,1,3,0,0,1,0]`. Match: Yes. (Reported result was incorrect).

*Note: Code execution for metric gathering is not strictly necessary here, as the analysis relies on comparing the provided expected outputs with the logic of the `Previous Code`, rather than calculating new metrics based on potentially flawed execution results.*

  - name: check_pattern_context
    input: input_sequence, index `i` of found pattern start
    output: boolean (is_isolated)
    description: For a found pattern at `i`, check if `input_sequence[i-1]` is 1 or if `input_sequence[i+2]` is 1 (handling boundary conditions). The pattern is "isolated" if neither is true.
  - name: modify_neighbors
    input: input_sequence, output_sequence, index `i` of isolated pattern start
    output: updated output_sequence
    description: If the pattern at `i` is isolated, check the neighbors `input_sequence[i-1]` and `input_sequence[i+2]`. If a neighbor exists and is 0, update the corresponding element in `output_sequence` to 3.

process_flow:
  - Create a deep copy of the `input_sequence` called `output_sequence`.
  - Iterate through the `input_sequence` with index `i` from 0 up to `length - 2`.
  - At each `i`, check if `input_sequence[i] == 1` and `input_sequence[i+1] == 1`.
  - If the pattern `[1, 1]` is found:
    - Determine if the pattern is "isolated":
      - Check if `i > 0` and `input_sequence[i-1] == 1`. This is `preceded_by_1`.
      - Check if `i + 2 < length` and `input_sequence[i+2] == 1`. This is `followed_by_1`.
      - The pattern is isolated if `not preceded_by_1` and `not followed_by_1`.
    - If the pattern is isolated:
      - Check the preceding neighbor: If `i > 0` and `input_sequence[i-1] == 0`, set `output_sequence[i-1] = 3`.
      - Check the succeeding neighbor: If `i + 2 < length` and `input_sequence[i+2] == 0`, set `output_sequence[i+2] = 3`.
  - After the loop completes, return the `output_sequence`.

constraints:
  - Modifications only occur around `[1, 1]` patterns.
  - The `[1, 1]` pattern must be isolated (not adjacent to another `1`) to trigger modifications.
  - Only neighbors with the value `0` are changed to `3`.
  - The original `input_sequence` is used for all checks (pattern finding, context checking, neighbor value checking); modifications are only applied to the `output_sequence`.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new list, `output_sequence`, as a copy of the `input_sequence`.
2.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` using an index `i` from the first element up to the second-to-last element.
3.  Check if the elements at `input_sequence[i]` and `input_sequence[i+1]` form the pattern `[1, 1]`.
4.  If the `[1, 1]` pattern is found at index `i`:
    a.  Determine if this pattern is "isolated". Check if it is preceded by a `1` (i.e., if `i > 0` and `input_sequence[i-1] == 1`) or followed by a `1` (i.e., if `i + 2` is within the list bounds and `input_sequence[i+2] == 1`).
    b.  If the pattern is *not* preceded by `1` AND *not* followed by `1` (meaning it is isolated):
        i.  Check the element *before* the pattern: If an element exists at index `i-1` and `input_sequence[i-1]` is `0`, change the element at `output_sequence[i-1]` to `3`.
        ii. Check the element *after* the pattern: If an element exists at index `i+2` and `input_sequence[i+2]` is `0`, change the element at `output_sequence[i+2]` to `3`.
5.  After checking all possible starting positions `i`, return the final `output_sequence`.
