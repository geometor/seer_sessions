However, the provided execution results revealed that the initial code failed on examples 2, 4, and 7. The key insight missed was a constraint revealed by examples 3 and 5: the transformation rule only applies when the `1 1` sequence is *isolated*, meaning it is not immediately preceded or followed by another `1`. Sequences like `1 1 1` or longer do not trigger the modification of adjacent `0`s. The strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code logic to incorporate this isolation check before modifying neighbors. The previous execution results showing the unmodified input for failed cases were likely inaccurate representations of the output from the flawed code; the flaw was the missing isolation check, leading to incorrect modifications (or lack thereof) according to the true rule.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    Based on the refined understanding of the rule (only isolated `1 1` triggers changes):\n\n    *   **Train 1:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)\n    *   **Train 2:** Input `[0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. One `1 1` pattern at index 2. Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 1 and `0` at index 4. 1 isolated `1 1`. 2 modifications. Output: `[0,3,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. (Previously Failed)\n    *   **Train 3:** Input `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 0, idx 1). Pattern at idx 0 is followed by `1`. Pattern at idx 1 is preceded by `1`. -> Not isolated. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)\n    *   **Train 4:** Input `[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]`. One `1 1` pattern at index 7. Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 6 and `0` at index 9. 1 isolated `1 1`. 2 modifications. Output: `[0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`. (Previously Failed)\n    *   **Train 5:** Input `[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 2, idx 3). Pattern at idx 2 is followed by `1`. Pattern at idx 3 is preceded by `1`. -> Not isolated. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)\n    *   **Train 6:** Input `[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)\n    *   **Train 7:** Input `[1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 0, idx 5). Pattern at idx 0: Preceded by boundary, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 2. Pattern at idx 5: Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 4 and `0` at index 7. 2 isolated `1 1`. 3 modifications. Output: `[1,1,3,0,3,1,1,3,0,0,1,0]`. (Previously Failed)\n    *   **Test 1:** Input `[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
