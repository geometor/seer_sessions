*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern (`1 1`) and the action (changing adjacent `0`s to `3`s). However, the provided execution results revealed that the initial code failed on examples 2, 4, and 7. The key insight missed was a constraint revealed by examples 3 and 5: the transformation rule only applies when the `1 1` sequence is *isolated*, meaning it is not immediately preceded or followed by another `1`. Sequences like `1 1 1` or longer do not trigger the modification of adjacent `0`s. The strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code logic to incorporate this isolation check before modifying neighbors. The previous execution results showing the unmodified input for failed cases were likely inaccurate representations of the output from the flawed code; the flaw was the missing isolation check, leading to incorrect modifications (or lack thereof) according to the true rule.

*   **Metrics:**
    Based on the refined understanding of the rule (only isolated `1 1` triggers changes):

    *   **Train 1:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)
    *   **Train 2:** Input `[0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. One `1 1` pattern at index 2. Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 1 and `0` at index 4. 1 isolated `1 1`. 2 modifications. Output: `[0,3,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. (Previously Failed)
    *   **Train 3:** Input `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 0, idx 1). Pattern at idx 0 is followed by `1`. Pattern at idx 1 is preceded by `1`. -> Not isolated. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)
    *   **Train 4:** Input `[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]`. One `1 1` pattern at index 7. Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 6 and `0` at index 9. 1 isolated `1 1`. 2 modifications. Output: `[0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`. (Previously Failed)
    *   **Train 5:** Input `[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 2, idx 3). Pattern at idx 2 is followed by `1`. Pattern at idx 3 is preceded by `1`. -> Not isolated. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)
    *   **Train 6:** Input `[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)
    *   **Train 7:** Input `[1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 0, idx 5). Pattern at idx 0: Preceded by boundary, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 2. Pattern at idx 5: Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 4 and `0` at index 7. 2 isolated `1 1`. 3 modifications. Output: `[1,1,3,0,3,1,1,3,0,0,1,0]`. (Previously Failed)
    *   **Test 1:** Input `[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)

    process_flow:
      - Initialize `output_sequence` as a deep copy of `input_sequence`.
      - Get the length `n` of the sequence.
      - Iterate through the `input_sequence` with index `i` from 0 to `n-2`.
      - At each `i`, check if `input_sequence[i] == 1` and `input_sequence[i+1] == 1`.
      - If the pattern `[1, 1]` is found:
        - Check for isolation:
          - `is_preceded_by_1 = (i > 0 and input_sequence[i-1] == 1)`
          - `is_followed_by_1 = (i + 2 < n and input_sequence[i+2] == 1)`
        - If `not is_preceded_by_1` and `not is_followed_by_1`:
          - The pattern is isolated. Proceed to modify neighbors in `output_sequence`.
          - Check element before: If `i > 0` and `input_sequence[i-1] == 0`, set `output_sequence[i-1] = 3`.
          - Check element after: If `i + 2 < n` and `input_sequence[i+2] == 0`, set `output_sequence[i+2] = 3`.
      - After the loop finishes, return the `output_sequence`.

    constraints:
      - The transformation only applies to sequences of *exactly* two consecutive 1s that are *isolated* (not part of a 111 sequence).
      - Only adjacent 0s to an isolated `1 1` sequence are modified.
      - The 1s in the pattern itself are never changed.
      - Modifications are based on the state of the original `input_sequence` and applied to the `output_sequence`.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Create a copy of the `input_sequence` called `output_sequence`.
    2.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` using an index `i` from the first element up to the second-to-last element.
    3.  At index `i`, check if the pattern `[1, 1]` exists (i.e., `input_sequence[i] == 1` and `input_sequence[i+1] == 1`).
    4.  If the `[1, 1]` pattern is found, check if it is isolated:
        a.  Determine if the pattern is preceded by a `1`: Check if index `i-1` is valid (`i > 0`) and if `input_sequence[i-1] == 1`.
        b.  Determine if the pattern is followed by a `1`: Check if index `i+2` is valid (`i+2 < length of input_sequence`) and if `input_sequence[i+2] == 1`.
        c.  The pattern is considered isolated *only if* it is neither preceded by a `1` nor followed by a `1`.
    5.  If the pattern at index `i` is isolated:
        a.  Check the element preceding the pattern: If index `i-1` is valid (`i > 0`) and `input_sequence[i-1]` is `0`, update the element at `output_sequence[i-1]` to `3`.
        b.  Check the element following the pattern: If index `i+2` is valid (`i+2 < length of input_sequence`) and `input_sequence[i+2]` is `0`, update the element at `output_sequence[i+2]` to `3`.
    6.  After checking all possible starting positions `i`, return the final `output_sequence`.
