```python
"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers (0s and 1s) based on a local rule.
The rule identifies sequences of exactly two consecutive '1's ([1, 1]) that are "isolated",
meaning they are not immediately preceded or followed by another '1'.
When such an isolated sequence is found at index i and i+1 in the input sequence:
1. If an element exists before the sequence (at index i-1) and its value is 0,
   that element's value in the output sequence is changed to 3.
2. If an element exists after the sequence (at index i+2) and its value is 0,
   that element's value in the output sequence is changed to 3.
All other elements from the input sequence, including non-isolated [1, 1] sequences
(those part of [1, 1, 1] or longer runs) and their neighbors, remain unchanged
in the output sequence. Modifications are based on the original input state and
applied to a separate output sequence.
