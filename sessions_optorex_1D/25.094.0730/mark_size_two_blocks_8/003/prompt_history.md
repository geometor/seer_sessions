*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of integers (0s and 1s) into another sequence of integers (0s, 1s, and 3s). The transformation rule appears to be local, modifying elements based on their neighbors. Specifically, the transformation focuses on identifying sequences of exactly two consecutive '1's. When such a sequence (`1 1`) is found, any '0' immediately preceding it or immediately following it is changed to a '3'. Other elements, including single '1's, sequences of three or more '1's, and '0's not adjacent to a `1 1` sequence, remain unchanged.

    process_flow:
      - Start with a copy of the input_sequence to create the initial output_sequence.
      - Iterate through the input_sequence from the first element up to the second-to-last element.
      - At each position `i`, check if the elements at `input_sequence[i]` and `input_sequence[i+1]` match the target_pattern [1, 1].
      - If the pattern matches:
        - Check the element *before* the pattern: If `i > 0` (an element exists before) and `input_sequence[i-1]` is 0, change the corresponding element in the output_sequence (`output_sequence[i-1]`) to 3.
        - Check the element *after* the pattern: If `i + 2 < length(input_sequence)` (an element exists after) and `input_sequence[i+2]` is 0, change the corresponding element in the output_sequence (`output_sequence[i+2]`) to 3.
      - Ensure that modifications are made to the output_sequence copy, not the input_sequence being iterated over, to avoid affecting subsequent checks within the same pass.
      - Return the final output_sequence.

    constraints:
      - The transformation only applies to sequences of *exactly* two consecutive 1s.
      - Longer sequences of 1s (e.g., `1 1 1`) do not trigger the transformation.
      - Single 1s do not trigger the transformation.
      - Only adjacent 0s are modified. Adjacent 1s or the 1s in the pattern itself are not changed.
      - Modifications happen based on the original input state; a 0 changed to 3 does not affect later checks in the same pass.

        a.  Check the element preceding the pattern: If the index `i-1` is valid (i.e., `i > 0`) and the element `input_sequence[i-1]` is 0, update the element at index `i-1` in the `output_sequence` to 3.
        b.  Check the element following the pattern: If the index `i+2` is valid (i.e., `i+2 < length of input_sequence`) and the element `input_sequence[i+2]` is 0, update the element at index `i+2` in the `output_sequence` to 3.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern (`1 1`) and the action (changing adjacent `0`s to `3`s). However, the provided execution results revealed that the initial code failed on examples 2, 4, and 7. The key insight missed was a constraint revealed by examples 3 and 5: the transformation rule only applies when the `1 1` sequence is *isolated*, meaning it is not immediately preceded or followed by another `1`. Sequences like `1 1 1` or longer do not trigger the modification of adjacent `0`s. The strategy is to refine the natural language program and subsequent code logic to incorporate this isolation check before modifying neighbors. The previous execution results showing the unmodified input for failed cases were likely inaccurate representations of the output from the flawed code; the flaw was the missing isolation check, leading to incorrect modifications (or lack thereof) according to the true rule.

*   **Metrics:**
    Based on the refined understanding of the rule (only isolated `1 1` triggers changes):

    *   **Train 1:** Input `[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)
    *   **Train 2:** Input `[0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. One `1 1` pattern at index 2. Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 1 and `0` at index 4. 1 isolated `1 1`. 2 modifications. Output: `[0,3,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. (Previously Failed)
    *   **Train 3:** Input `[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 0, idx 1). Pattern at idx 0 is followed by `1`. Pattern at idx 1 is preceded by `1`. -> Not isolated. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)
    *   **Train 4:** Input `[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]`. One `1 1` pattern at index 7. Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 6 and `0` at index 9. 1 isolated `1 1`. 2 modifications. Output: `[0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`. (Previously Failed)
    *   **Train 5:** Input `[0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 2, idx 3). Pattern at idx 2 is followed by `1`. Pattern at idx 3 is preceded by `1`. -> Not isolated. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)
    *   **Train 6:** Input `[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)
    *   **Train 7:** Input `[1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0]`. Two `1 1` patterns (idx 0, idx 5). Pattern at idx 0: Preceded by boundary, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 2. Pattern at idx 5: Preceded by `0`, followed by `0`. -> Isolated. Modify `0` at index 4 and `0` at index 7. 2 isolated `1 1`. 3 modifications. Output: `[1,1,3,0,3,1,1,3,0,0,1,0]`. (Previously Failed)
    *   **Test 1:** Input `[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]`. No `1 1` patterns. 0 isolated `1 1`. 0 modifications. Output == Input. (Passed)

    4.  If the `[1, 1]` pattern is found, check if it is isolated:
        a.  Determine if the pattern is preceded by a `1`: Check if index `i-1` is valid (`i > 0`) and if `input_sequence[i-1] == 1`.
        b.  Determine if the pattern is followed by a `1`: Check if index `i+2` is valid (`i+2 < length of input_sequence`) and if `input_sequence[i+2] == 1`.
        c.  The pattern is considered isolated *only if* it is neither preceded by a `1` nor followed by a `1`.
    5.  If the pattern at index `i` is isolated:
        a.  Check the element preceding the pattern: If index `i-1` is valid (`i > 0`) and `input_sequence[i-1]` is `0`, update the element at `output_sequence[i-1]` to `3`.
        b.  Check the element following the pattern: If index `i+2` is valid (`i+2 < length of input_sequence`) and `input_sequence[i+2]` is `0`, update the element at `output_sequence[i+2]` to `3`.
    6.  After checking all possible starting positions `i`, return the final `output_sequence`.
