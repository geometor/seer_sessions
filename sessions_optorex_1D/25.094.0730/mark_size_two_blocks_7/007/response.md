"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 1s based on the following rule:
Find all contiguous blocks of 1s within the input sequence.
For each block that has a length of exactly 2 (i.e., a '1 1' sub-sequence), 
check its adjacent elements in the *original* input sequence.
If the element immediately before the '1 1' block exists and is 0, change the 
corresponding element in the output sequence to 3.
If the element immediately after the '1 1' block exists and is 0, change the 
corresponding element in the output sequence to 3.
All other elements remain unchanged. Blocks of 1s with lengths other than 2 
do not trigger any changes.
