Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output consist of sequences of single-digit integers, specifically 0s and 1s in the input, and 0s, 1s, and 3s in the output. The sequences appear to be space-delimited strings representing lists of integers.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change is the replacement of certain `0`s in the input sequence with `3`s in the output sequence. Not all `0`s are changed, and `1`s are never changed.
3.  **Identifying the Trigger:** By comparing the inputs and outputs where changes occur (train_1, train_6, train_7), we can observe a pattern related to blocks of consecutive `1`s.
    *   In `train_1`, the input `1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0` changes to `1 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 0 1 0`. The changes (`0` to `3`) occur at index 4 and index 7. These indices are immediately adjacent (before and after) the block `1 1` at indices 5 and 6.
    *   In `train_6`, the input `1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0` changes to `1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0`. The change occurs at index 2, which is immediately after the block `1 1` at indices 0 and 1. The `0` at index 11, which follows a single `1`, does not change.
    *   In `train_7`, the input `1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0` changes to `1 1 3 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0`. The change occurs at index 2, immediately after the block `1 1` at indices 0 and 1. The `0` at index 10, which follows the block `1 1 1`, does not change.
    *   In examples where no changes occur (train_2, train_3, train_4, train_5), there are no blocks of exactly two consecutive `1`s. Blocks of length 1 (`1`) or length 3 (`1 1 1`) do not trigger the change in adjacent `0`s.
4.  **Conclusion:** The transformation rule is: find all occurrences of the sub-sequence `1 1`. If a `0` exists immediately before this `1 1` block or immediately after it, change that `0` to a `3`.

**YAML Facts:**

    effect:
      - Keep the element's value unchanged in the output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 0s and 1s.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the basis for the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index, from the beginning to the end.
4.  At each position `i`, check if the sub-sequence starting at `i` is `1 1` (i.e., input[i] == 1 and input[i+1] == 1), ensuring not to go out of bounds.
5.  If such a `1 1` block is found at indices `i` and `i+1`:
    a.  Check the element at index `i-1` (if `i > 0`). If it exists and its value is `0`, change the corresponding element in the output sequence copy (at index `i-1`) to `3`.
    b.  Check the element at index `i+2` (if `i+2` is within the sequence bounds). If it exists and its value is `0`, change the corresponding element in the output sequence copy (at index `i+2`) to `3`.
6.  After checking all possible starting positions `i` for the `1 1` block, the output sequence copy contains the final transformed sequence.
7.  Format the resulting sequence into the required output string format (space-separated integers).

## General Assessment and Strategy

The initial analysis and the subsequent code implementation (referred to as `code_00.py`) incorrectly identified the transformation trigger. The code assumed that only *isolated* `1 1` blocks (those not part of a `1 1 1` sequence) caused adjacent `0`s to change to `3`s.

The provided results clearly show this assumption was wrong. Examples `train_1`, `train_6`, `train_7`, and `test_1` failed because the transformation *should* have occurred, but the isolation check prevented it. Conversely, examples `train_2`, `train_4`, and `train_5` correctly showed no transformation, which reinforced the idea that `1 1 1` blocks are inert regarding this rule.

The correct pattern, confirmed by re-evaluating all examples, is that the transformation is triggered *only* by contiguous blocks of `1`s that have a length of *exactly two*. Blocks of length one (`1`) or length three or more (`1 1 1`, etc.) do not trigger the change.

**Strategy:**
1.  Accurately identify all contiguous blocks of `1`s in the input sequence.
2.  Determine the length of each identified block.
3.  For blocks with length exactly 2, check the elements immediately preceding and succeeding the block in the *original* input sequence.
4.  If a preceding/succeeding element exists and is `0`, change the corresponding element in the *output* sequence to `3`.
5.  All other elements remain unchanged from the input.
6.  Update the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program to reflect this precise rule.

**Observations from Metrics:**
*   The `rule_match` field is `true` for all examples, confirming that the number of `3`s in the output (`output_threes`) consistently equals the number of `0`s found adjacent to blocks of `1`s with length exactly 2 (`zeros_adjacent_to_one_one`).
*   Examples with `one_one_blocks_count` > 0 (train_1, train_6, train_7, test_1) are the only ones with `output_threes` > 0.
*   Examples with only blocks of length 1 or 3 (train_2, train_3, train_4, train_5) have `output_threes` = 0.
*   This strongly validates the hypothesis that only `1 1` blocks (length 2) trigger the transformation.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of 0s and 1s.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous blocks consisting solely of `1`s. Record the start index, end index, and length for each block.
4.  Iterate through the identified blocks of `1`s.
5.  For each block, check if its length is exactly 2.
6.  If a block's length is exactly 2 (representing a `1 1` subsequence):
    a.  Check the element in the *original input sequence* at the index immediately *before* the block's start index. If this index is valid (>= 0) and the element at that index is `0`, change the value in the *output sequence* at that same index to `3`.
    b.  Check the element in the *original input sequence* at the index immediately *after* the block's end index. If this index is valid (< sequence length) and the element at that index is `0`, change the value in the *output sequence* at that same index to `3`.
7.  After checking all blocks, the modified output sequence contains the final result.
8.  Return the final output sequence.
