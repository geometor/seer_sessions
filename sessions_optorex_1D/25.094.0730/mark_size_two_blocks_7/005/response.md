"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 1s based on the following rule:
Find all occurrences of an *isolated* sub-sequence '1 1' (meaning it is not 
part of a '1 1 1' or longer sequence). 
If a '0' exists in the original sequence immediately before this isolated 
'1 1' block, change the corresponding element in the output sequence to '3'.
If a '0' exists in the original sequence immediately after this isolated 
'1 1' block, change the corresponding element in the output sequence to '3'.
All other numbers remain unchanged.
