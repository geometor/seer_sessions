elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input and output are sequences of integers.
  - type: integer
    value: 0
    description: Present in input and output. Can be transformed to 3 under specific conditions.
  - type: integer
    value: 1
    description: Present in input and output. Unchanged. Forms contiguous blocks.
  - type: integer
    value: 3
    description: Present only in output. Replaces specific 0s adjacent to '1 1' blocks.

objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence
    properties:
      - contains: [0, 1]
      - length: integer
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence
    properties:
      - contains: [0, 1, 3]
      - length: integer (same as input_sequence)
  - name: one_block
    type: sub-sequence
    description: A contiguous run of one or more '1's within the input sequence.
    properties:
      - content: [1, 1, ..., 1]
      - length: integer (number of 1s in the block)
      - position: start and end indices within the input_sequence

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: A '0' in the input_sequence can be immediately before (at index start-1) or immediately after (at index end+1) a 'one_block'.

actions:
  - name: transform_zero_to_three
    conditions:
      - element is '0' in input_sequence.
      - element is adjacent (immediately before or after) to a 'one_block'.
      - the 'length' property of that adjacent 'one_block' is exactly 2.
    effect:
      - the corresponding element in the output_sequence is set to '3'.
  - name: copy_element
    conditions:
      - any element not matching the 'transform_zero_to_three' conditions.
    effect:
      - the corresponding element in the output_sequence retains the value from the input_sequence.
