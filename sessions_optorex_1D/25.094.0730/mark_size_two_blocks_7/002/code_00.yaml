elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input and output are sequences (arrays/lists) of integers.
  - type: integer
    value: 0
    description: Present in input and output. Can be transformed to 3 under specific conditions.
  - type: integer
    value: 1
    description: Present in input and output. Unchanged. Defines critical blocks for transformation.
  - type: integer
    value: 3
    description: Present only in output. Result of transforming specific 0s.
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: array/list[int]
    properties:
      - contains: [0, 1]
  - name: output_sequence
    type: array/list[int]
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_sequence
      - contains: [0, 1, 3]
  - name: target_block
    type: sub-sequence
    description: The specific sequence '1, 1' within the input sequence.
    properties:
      - elements: [1, 1]
      - position: start index 'i'
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: A '0' element in the input sequence can be immediately before (index i-1) or immediately after (index i+2) a 'target_block'.
actions:
  - name: transform_adjacent_zero
    conditions:
      - An element at index `j` in the input_sequence is '0'.
      - This '0' is adjacent to a 'target_block' (i.e., `j = i-1` or `j = i+2` for a 'target_block' starting at `i`).
    effect:
      - Set the element at index `j` in the output_sequence to '3'.
  - name: copy_element
    conditions:
      - An element does not meet the conditions for 'transform_adjacent_zero'.
    effect:
      - Copy the element from the input_sequence to the corresponding position in the output_sequence.
