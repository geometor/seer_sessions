            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided execution results consistently show an `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`. This clearly indicates that the `transform` function, specifically its helper `parse_input`, was expecting a string input (based on the initial presentation of examples) but received a NumPy array instead. The core transformation logic (identifying `1 1` sequences and changing adjacent `0`s to `3`s) was not actually tested due to this input type mismatch.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the input handling mechanism to work directly with NumPy arrays (or lists of integers, which NumPy arrays behave similarly to in this context) instead of expecting string parsing. The fundamental transformation logic derived previously appears sound based on the visual examples and should be retained but applied to the correct data structure.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nDue to the immediate failure on input processing, no meaningful metrics about the transformation logic's success or failure on individual examples can be derived from the execution logs.\n\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError`\n*   **Error Message:** `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`\n*   **Consistency:** Error occurred identically across all 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the logs.\n*   **Conclusion:** Input is consistently provided as a NumPy array, not a string.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
