Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output consist of sequences of single-digit integers, specifically 0s and 1s in the input, and 0s, 1s, and 3s in the output. The sequences appear to be space-delimited strings representing lists of integers.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change is the replacement of certain `0`s in the input sequence with `3`s in the output sequence. Not all `0`s are changed, and `1`s are never changed.
3.  **Identifying the Trigger:** By comparing the inputs and outputs where changes occur (train_1, train_6, train_7), we can observe a pattern related to blocks of consecutive `1`s.
    *   In `train_1`, the input `1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0` changes to `1 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 0 1 0`. The changes (`0` to `3`) occur at index 4 and index 7. These indices are immediately adjacent (before and after) the block `1 1` at indices 5 and 6.
    *   In `train_6`, the input `1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0` changes to `1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0`. The change occurs at index 2, which is immediately after the block `1 1` at indices 0 and 1. The `0` at index 11, which follows a single `1`, does not change.
    *   In `train_7`, the input `1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0` changes to `1 1 3 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0`. The change occurs at index 2, immediately after the block `1 1` at indices 0 and 1. The `0` at index 10, which follows the block `1 1 1`, does not change.
    *   In examples where no changes occur (train_2, train_3, train_4, train_5), there are no blocks of exactly two consecutive `1`s. Blocks of length 1 (`1`) or length 3 (`1 1 1`) do not trigger the change in adjacent `0`s.
4.  **Conclusion:** The transformation rule is: find all occurrences of the sub-sequence `1 1`. If a `0` exists immediately before this `1 1` block or immediately after it, change that `0` to a `3`.

**YAML Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 0s and 1s.
2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the basis for the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index, from the beginning to the end.
4.  At each position `i`, check if the sub-sequence starting at `i` is `1 1` (i.e., input[i] == 1 and input[i+1] == 1), ensuring not to go out of bounds.
5.  If such a `1 1` block is found at indices `i` and `i+1`:
    a.  Check the element at index `i-1` (if `i > 0`). If it exists and its value is `0`, change the corresponding element in the output sequence copy (at index `i-1`) to `3`.
    b.  Check the element at index `i+2` (if `i+2` is within the sequence bounds). If it exists and its value is `0`, change the corresponding element in the output sequence copy (at index `i+2`) to `3`.
6.  After checking all possible starting positions `i` for the `1 1` block, the output sequence copy contains the final transformed sequence.
7.  Format the resulting sequence into the required output string format (space-separated integers).
