"""
Transforms a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 0s and 1s based on the 
following rule:
Find all occurrences of the sub-sequence [1, 1]. 
If a 0 exists immediately before this [1, 1] block in the original sequence, 
change the corresponding element in the output sequence to 3.
If a 0 exists immediately after this [1, 1] block in the original sequence, 
change the corresponding element in the output sequence to 3.
All other numbers remain unchanged.
