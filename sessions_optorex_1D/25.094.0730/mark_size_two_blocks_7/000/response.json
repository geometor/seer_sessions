            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Data Type:** Both input and output consist of sequences of single-digit integers, specifically 0s and 1s in the input, and 0s, 1s, and 3s in the output. The sequences appear to be space-delimited strings representing lists of integers.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change is the replacement of certain `0`s in the input sequence with `3`s in the output sequence. Not all `0`s are changed, and `1`s are never changed.\n3.  **Identifying the Trigger:** By comparing the inputs and outputs where changes occur (train_1, train_6, train_7), we can observe a pattern related to blocks of consecutive `1`s.\n    *   In `train_1`, the input `1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0` changes to `1 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 0 1 0`. The changes (`0` to `3`) occur at index 4 and index 7. These indices are immediately adjacent (before and after) the block `1 1` at indices 5 and 6.\n    *   In `train_6`, the input `1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0` changes to `1 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0`. The change occurs at index 2, which is immediately after the block `1 1` at indices 0 and 1. The `0` at index 11, which follows a single `1`, does not change.\n    *   In `train_7`, the input `1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0` changes to `1 1 3 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0`. The change occurs at index 2, immediately after the block `1 1` at indices 0 and 1. The `0` at index 10, which follows the block `1 1 1`, does not change.\n    *   In examples where no changes occur (train_2, train_3, train_4, train_5), there are no blocks of exactly two consecutive `1`s. Blocks of length 1 (`1`) or length 3 (`1 1 1`) do not trigger the change in adjacent `0`s.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The transformation rule is: find all occurrences of the sub-sequence `1 1`. If a `0` exists immediately before this `1 1` block or immediately after it, change that `0` to a `3`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
