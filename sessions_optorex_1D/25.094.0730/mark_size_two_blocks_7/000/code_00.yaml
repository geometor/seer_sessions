elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input and output are sequences of integers.
  - type: integer
    value: 0
    description: Present in input and output. Can be transformed to 3.
  - type: integer
    value: 1
    description: Present in input and output. Unchanged. Defines blocks.
  - type: integer
    value: 3
    description: Present only in output. Replaces specific 0s.
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence
    properties:
      - contains: [0, 1]
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence
    properties:
      - contains: [0, 1, 3]
  - name: one_block
    type: sub-sequence
    description: A contiguous run of one or more '1's within the input sequence.
    properties:
      - length: integer (number of 1s in the block)
      - position: start and end indices
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: A '0' can be immediately before or immediately after a 'one_block'.
actions:
  - name: transform_zero
    conditions:
      - The element is '0'.
      - The '0' is adjacent (immediately before or after) a 'one_block'.
      - The 'length' property of the adjacent 'one_block' is exactly 2.
    effect:
      - Change the value of the '0' element to '3'.
  - name: copy_element
    conditions:
      - Any element not matching the 'transform_zero' conditions.
    effect:
      - Keep the element's value unchanged in the output sequence.
