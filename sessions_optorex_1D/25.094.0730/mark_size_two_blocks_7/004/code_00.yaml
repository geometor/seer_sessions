elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: Input and output are sequences of integers. Represented as space-delimited strings.
  - type: integer
    value: 0
    description: Present in input and output. Can be transformed to 3 under specific conditions.
  - type: integer
    value: 1
    description: Present in input and output. Unchanged. Defines trigger patterns.
  - type: integer
    value: 3
    description: Present only in output. Replaces specific 0s from the input.
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: The initial sequence containing only 0s and 1s.
    properties:
      - length: integer
      - elements: [0, 1]
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    description: The transformed sequence containing 0s, 1s, and 3s. Derived from the input sequence.
    properties:
      - length: integer (same as input)
      - elements: [0, 1, 3]
  - name: two_ones_block
    type: sub-sequence
    description: A specific pattern `[1, 1]` within the input sequence that triggers transformations. Critically, this pattern must not be preceded or followed immediately by another '1'.
    properties:
      - position: index `i` such that input[i]==1 and input[i+1]==1.
      - context_check: Requires input[i-1] != 1 (if i>0) and input[i+2] != 1 (if i+2 < length).
relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: A '0' in the input sequence is considered adjacent if it is at index `i-1` or `i+2` relative to the start (`i`) of a 'two_ones_block'.
actions:
  - name: transform_adjacent_zero
    conditions:
      - An element in the input sequence is '0'.
      - This '0' is located at index `i-1` (and `i>0`) or `i+2` (and `i+2 < length`) where indices `i` and `i+1` form a 'two_ones_block' (i.e., input[i]==1, input[i+1]==1, input[i-1]!=1 if exists, input[i+2]!=1 if exists).
    effect:
      - The element at the corresponding position in the output sequence is set to '3'.
  - name: copy_element
    conditions:
      - An element in the input sequence does not meet the conditions for 'transform_adjacent_zero'.
    effect:
      - The element's value is copied directly to the corresponding position in the output sequence.
