In many cases (train\\_2 through train\\_7), the output is identical to the input.\n    *   In train\\_1, a change occurs: specific 0s in the input are replaced by 3s in the output.\n    *   The change in train\\_1 seems related to the presence of the subsequence `1 1`. Specifically, 0s immediately adjacent to a `1 1` subsequence (`0 1 1 0`) are replaced by 3s.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
