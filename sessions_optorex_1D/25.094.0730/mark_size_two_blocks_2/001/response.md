"""
This program transforms a list of integers based on a specific pattern.
It iterates through the input list, looking for the subsequence [0, 1, 1, 0].
If this pattern is found starting at index i, the elements at indices i and i+3 
in the output list are changed to 3. Otherwise, elements are copied directly 
from the input to the output.

        A new list of integers with the transformation applied.
