            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided code failed to correctly transform the input sequences in most training examples. Specifically, it failed to change any '0's to '3's, indicating a fundamental flaw in the implementation of the transformation logic derived from the initial observations. The results show that the code produced output identical to the input in cases where changes were expected.\n\nThe core transformation involves changing '0's to '3's based on adjacency to the sub-sequence '1 1'. However, example `train_5` (`1 1 1 0 0...` -> `1 1 1 0 0...`) shows an exclusion: a '0' following `1 1 1` does not change. Similarly, although not explicitly shown, we can infer from `train_2` (`0 1 1 0...` -> `3 1 1 3...`) that the change *does* happen when the '1 1' is followed by a '0', implying that a potential `0 1 1 1` pattern would likely *not* cause the initial '0' to change.\n\nThe strategy is to refine the natural language program and the underlying logic to correctly capture both the transformation rule (adjacency to '1 1') and the exclusion rule (when the '1 1' is part of a '1 1 1' sequence). The code implementation must then accurately reflect this refined logic, checking boundary conditions and the specific exclusion patterns (`1 1 1 0` and inferred `0 1 1 1`).\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\nLet's gather metrics for each example to better understand the transformations.\n\n"
