            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue identified is a `TypeError` because the provided code expects a string input (`input_str.split()`) while the testing environment supplies a NumPy array. The transformation logic itself, based on the initial analysis, seemed plausible but failed on some examples when scrutinized more closely.\n\nThe strategy involves:\n1.  Correcting the input handling to accept a sequence of integers (list or NumPy array).\n2.  Re-evaluating and refining the transformation rule based on *all* provided training examples to ensure accuracy, particularly addressing the cases where a '0' adjacent to '1 1' did *not* change. The refined hypothesis is that the change only occurs if the '1 1' pattern is *not* part of a '1 1 1' pattern.\n3.  Updating the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect the corrected input type and the refined transformation rule.\n4.  Ensuring the output format matches the required space-separated string format (although the error message might imply otherwise, we will stick to the format shown in the examples).\n\n**Metrics and Rule Verification:**\n\nNo code execution metrics are available due to the initial error. Verification must rely on manual checking against the examples using the refined rule.\n\n*   **Refined Rule:** A '0' at index `i` in the input sequence `L` of length `n` changes to '3' if *either* of the following conditions is met:\n    1.  `i >= 2` AND `L[i-2] == 1` AND `L[i-1] == 1` AND (`i < 3` OR `L[i-3] != 1`)\n    2.  `i <= n - 3` AND `L[i+1] == 1` AND `L[i+2] == 1` AND (`i > n - 4` OR `L[i+3] != 1`)\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   **train_1:** Input `[1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]`. Output `[1,1,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]`.\n        *   `i=2` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[0]=1`, `L[1]=1`, `i<3`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n    *   **train_2:** Input `[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]`. Output `[3,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]`.\n        *   `i=0` (value 0): Meets condition 2 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, `L[3]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n        *   `i=3` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, `L[0]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n        *   `i=11` (value 0): Condition 1 (`L[9]=1`, `L[10]=1`, but `L[8]=1`). Fails. Condition 2 (out of bounds). Fails. -> Stays 0. Correct.\n    *   **train_3:** Input `[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. Output `[3,1,1,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`.\n        *   `i=0` (value 0): Meets condition 2 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, `L[3]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n        *   `i=3` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, `L[0]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n    *   **train_4:** Input `[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. Output `[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. No '1 1' sequences. No changes. Correct.\n    *   **train_5:** Input `[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. Output `[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`.\n        *   `i=3` (value 0): Condition 1 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, but `L[0]=1`). Fails. Condition 2 (`L[4]=0`). Fails. -> Stays 0. Correct.\n    *   **train_6:** Input `[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]`. Output `[0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`.\n        *   `i=6` (value 0): Meets condition 2 (`L[7]=1`, `L[8]=1`, `L[9]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n        *   `i=9` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[7]=1`, `L[8]=1`, `L[6]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n    *   **train_7:** Input `[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]`. Output `[1,1,3,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`.\n        *   `i=2` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[0]=1`, `L[1]=1`, `i<3`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n        *   `i=6` (value 0): Meets condition 2 (`L[7]=1`, `L[8]=1`, `L[9]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n        *   `i=9` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[7]=1`, `L[8]=1`, `L[6]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.\n\nThe refined rule appears consistent with all examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
