elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list of single digits (integers 0 or 1 in input, 0, 1, or 3 in output).
    properties:
      - length: Preserved between input and output.
      - values: Primarily 0 and 1, with 3 appearing in the output under specific conditions.
objects:
  - object: digit_zero
    description: The digit '0' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - mutable: Can change to '3'.
      - condition_for_change: Must be immediately adjacent to the sub-sequence '1 1'.
  - object: digit_one
    description: The digit '1' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - immutable: Does not change.
  - object: digit_three
    description: The digit '3' appearing only in the output sequence.
    properties:
      - origin: Replaces a '0' from the input sequence.
relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: The position of a digit relative to its immediate neighbors.
    property: Crucial for determining the transformation of '0'.
  - relationship: sub-sequence
    description: A specific ordered pattern within the main sequence.
    property: The pattern '1 1' acts as a trigger for changing adjacent '0's.
actions:
  - action: identify_zeros
    description: Locate all instances of the digit '0' in the input sequence.
  - action: check_adjacency
    description: For each '0', examine the two preceding and two succeeding digits (if they exist within the sequence bounds).
  - action: detect_pattern
    description: Determine if the adjacent digits form the sequence '1 1'.
  - action: replace_zero_with_three
    description: If a '0' is adjacent to '1 1', replace it with '3' in the output sequence.
  - action: copy_unaffected_digits
    description: All '1's and any '0's not meeting the adjacency condition are copied directly from input to output.
