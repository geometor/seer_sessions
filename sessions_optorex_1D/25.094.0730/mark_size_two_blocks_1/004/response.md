**General Assessment:**

The provided results indicate that the previous transformation logic, as implemented or reported, failed to correctly identify all instances where a '0' should be changed to a '3'. The failures occurred specifically when a '0' was adjacent to a '1 1' pattern. The successful examples (`train_4`, `train_5`, `test_1`) involve either no '0's adjacent to '1 1' or cases like `1 1 1 0` or `0 1 1 1` where the '0' should *not* change.

The errors consistently show '0' in the transformed output where '3' was expected. This suggests the core condition for changing '0' to '3' (adjacency to '1 1') was the point of failure in the previous attempt's execution or reporting.

The strategy is to refine the description of the transformation rule, ensuring the conditions for changing '0' to '3' are precisely stated, including the necessary checks for boundary conditions and the specific exclusion related to the '1 1 1' pattern. We will assume the rule derived from the initial analysis (0 changes to 3 if next to '1 1' but *not* if that '1 1' is part of '1 1 1') is correct and restate it clearly.

**Metrics:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create an output sequence, initially identical to the input sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from the beginning to the end.
4.  At each index `i`, check if the digit in the *input* sequence is '0'.
5.  If the digit at index `i` is '0', perform the following checks:
    a.  **Check Left:** Determine if the pattern `1 1 0` ends at index `i`. This requires checking:
        i.  `i` is greater than or equal to 2.
        ii. The digit at index `i-2` in the input is '1'.
        iii. The digit at index `i-1` in the input is '1'.
        iv. **Exclusion:** This condition is only valid if *either* `i` is exactly 2 (meaning there's no digit before the '1 1') *or* the digit at index `i-3` in the input is '0'. (This prevents changing '0' in `1 1 1 0`). Let this outcome be `left_condition_met`.
    b.  **Check Right:** Determine if the pattern `0 1 1` starts at index `i`. This requires checking:
        i.  `i` is less than or equal to `length - 3` (where `length` is the total number of digits).
        ii. The digit at index `i+1` in the input is '1'.
        iii. The digit at index `i+2` in the input is '1'.
        iv. **Exclusion:** This condition is only valid if *either* `i` is exactly `length - 3` (meaning there's no digit after the '1 1') *or* the digit at index `i+3` in the input is '0'. (This prevents changing '0' in `0 1 1 1`). Let this outcome be `right_condition_met`.
    c.  **Apply Change:** If `left_condition_met` is true OR `right_condition_met` is true, change the digit at index `i` in the *output* sequence to '3'.
6.  If the digit at index `i` in the input sequence was '1', or if it was '0' but neither `left_condition_met` nor `right_condition_met` was true, the digit at index `i` in the output sequence remains unchanged (it keeps its value from the initial copy).
7.  After iterating through all indices, format the output sequence into the final required format (e.g., space-separated string or list, matching the expected output format).
