Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged between input and output.
3.  **Digit Types:**
    *   Input sequences contain only '0' and '1'.
    *   Output sequences contain '0', '1', and '3'.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be changing specific '0's in the input sequence to '3's in the output sequence. The '1's remain unchanged.
5.  **Condition for Change:** Observing the examples, a '0' changes to a '3' if and only if it is immediately adjacent (either directly before or directly after) the specific two-digit sequence '1 1'.
    *   Example `... 0 1 1 ...` becomes `... 3 1 1 ...` (See train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7)
    *   Example `... 1 1 0 ...` becomes `... 1 1 3 ...` (See train_1, train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7)
6.  **No Change Cases:** If a '0' is not adjacent to a '1 1' sequence, it remains '0'. If the sequence is '1 1 1', adjacent '0's are *not* changed (See train_1, train_5).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list of single digits (integers 0 or 1 in input, 0, 1, or 3 in output).
    properties:
      - length: Preserved between input and output.
      - values: Primarily 0 and 1, with 3 appearing in the output under specific conditions.
objects:
  - object: digit_zero
    description: The digit '0' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - mutable: Can change to '3'.
      - condition_for_change: Must be immediately adjacent to the sub-sequence '1 1'.
  - object: digit_one
    description: The digit '1' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - immutable: Does not change.
  - object: digit_three
    description: The digit '3' appearing only in the output sequence.
    properties:
      - origin: Replaces a '0' from the input sequence.
relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: The position of a digit relative to its immediate neighbors.
    property: Crucial for determining the transformation of '0'.
  - relationship: sub-sequence
    description: A specific ordered pattern within the main sequence.
    property: The pattern '1 1' acts as a trigger for changing adjacent '0's.
actions:
  - action: identify_zeros
    description: Locate all instances of the digit '0' in the input sequence.
  - action: check_adjacency
    description: For each '0', examine the two preceding and two succeeding digits (if they exist within the sequence bounds).
  - action: detect_pattern
    description: Determine if the adjacent digits form the sequence '1 1'.
  - action: replace_zero_with_three
    description: If a '0' is adjacent to '1 1', replace it with '3' in the output sequence.
  - action: copy_unaffected_digits
    description: All '1's and any '0's not meeting the adjacency condition are copied directly from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Create a new sequence, initially identical to the input sequence, to store the output.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index, examining each digit.
4.  If the digit at the current index in the *input* sequence is '0':
    a.  Check if the two digits immediately *before* the current index (if they exist) form the sequence '1 1'.
    b.  Check if the two digits immediately *after* the current index (if they exist) form the sequence '1 1'.
    c.  If either check (a) or (b) is true, change the digit at the current index in the *output* sequence to '3'.
5.  If the digit at the current index in the input sequence is '1', or if it is '0' but neither adjacency check (4a, 4b) was true, keep the digit unchanged in the output sequence.
6.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, format the output sequence as a string of space-separated digits.
```python
import math
import re

"""
Transformation rule:
Iterate through the input sequence of digits. If a digit is '0', check if it is immediately adjacent to the sub-sequence '1 1'. Specifically, check if the pattern '1 1 0' or '0 1 1' exists at that position. If either pattern is found, change the '0' to '3' in the output sequence. Otherwise, keep the digit as it is. All '1's remain unchanged.

Transformation rule:
Accepts a sequence of integers (0s and 1s).
Iterate through the input sequence. If a digit is 0 at index 'i', check two conditions:
1. Preceding Pattern: Check if the sequence ends with '1 1 0' at index 'i' (i.e., elements at i-2 and i-1 are 1), AND this '1 1' is NOT preceded by another 1 (i.e., element at i-3 is not 1, or i=2).
2. Following Pattern: Check if the sequence starts with '0 1 1' at index 'i' (i.e., elements at i+1 and i+2 are 1), AND this '1 1' is NOT followed by another 1 (i.e., element at i+3 is not 1, or i=n-3 where n is the length).
If either condition is true, change the 0 at index 'i' to 3 in the output sequence.
Otherwise, the digit (0 or 1) remains unchanged.
