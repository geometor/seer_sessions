Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged between input and output.
3.  **Digit Types:**
    *   Input sequences contain only '0' and '1'.
    *   Output sequences contain '0', '1', and '3'.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be changing specific '0's in the input sequence to '3's in the output sequence. The '1's remain unchanged.
5.  **Condition for Change:** Observing the examples, a '0' changes to a '3' if and only if it is immediately adjacent (either directly before or directly after) the specific two-digit sequence '1 1'.
    *   Example `... 0 1 1 ...` becomes `... 3 1 1 ...` (See train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7)
    *   Example `... 1 1 0 ...` becomes `... 1 1 3 ...` (See train_1, train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7)
6.  **No Change Cases:** If a '0' is not adjacent to a '1 1' sequence, it remains '0'. If the sequence is '1 1 1', adjacent '0's are *not* changed (See train_1, train_5).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml

  - object: digit_zero
    description: The digit '0' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - mutable: Can change to '3'.
      - condition_for_change: Must be immediately adjacent to the sub-sequence '1 1'.
  - object: digit_one
    description: The digit '1' in the sequence.

    property: Crucial for determining the transformation of '0'.
  - relationship: sub-sequence
    description: A specific ordered pattern within the main sequence.
    property: The pattern '1 1' acts as a trigger for changing adjacent '0's.
actions:
  - action: identify_zeros
    description: Locate all instances of the digit '0' in the input sequence.
  - action: check_adjacency
    description: For each '0', examine the two preceding and two succeeding digits (if they exist within the sequence bounds).
  - action: detect_pattern
    description: Determine if the adjacent digits form the sequence '1 1'.
  - action: replace_zero_with_three
    description: If a '0' is adjacent to '1 1', replace it with '3' in the output sequence.
  - action: copy_unaffected_digits
    description: All '1's and any '0's not meeting the adjacency condition are copied directly from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Create a new sequence, initially identical to the input sequence, to store the output.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index, examining each digit.
4.  If the digit at the current index in the *input* sequence is '0':
    a.  Check if the two digits immediately *before* the current index (if they exist) form the sequence '1 1'.
    b.  Check if the two digits immediately *after* the current index (if they exist) form the sequence '1 1'.
    c.  If either check (a) or (b) is true, change the digit at the current index in the *output* sequence to '3'.
5.  If the digit at the current index in the input sequence is '1', or if it is '0' but neither adjacency check (4a, 4b) was true, keep the digit unchanged in the output sequence.
6.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, format the output sequence as a string of space-separated digits.
```python
import math

All '1's remain unchanged.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The primary issue identified is a `TypeError` because the provided code expects a string input (`input_str.split()`) while the testing environment supplies a NumPy array. The transformation logic itself, based on the initial analysis, seemed plausible but failed on some examples when scrutinized more closely.

The strategy involves:
1.  Correcting the input handling to accept a sequence of integers (list or NumPy array).
2.  Re-evaluating and refining the transformation rule based on *all* provided training examples to ensure accuracy, particularly addressing the cases where a '0' adjacent to '1 1' did *not* change. The refined hypothesis is that the change only occurs if the '1 1' pattern is *not* part of a '1 1 1' pattern.
3.  Updating the natural language program and YAML facts to reflect the corrected input type and the refined transformation rule.
4.  Ensuring the output format matches the required space-separated string format (although the error message might imply otherwise, we will stick to the format shown in the examples).

**Metrics and Rule Verification:**

No code execution metrics are available due to the initial error. Verification must rely on manual checking against the examples using the refined rule.

*   **Refined Rule:** A '0' at index `i` in the input sequence `L` of length `n` changes to '3' if *either* of the following conditions is met:
    1.  `i >= 2` AND `L[i-2] == 1` AND `L[i-1] == 1` AND (`i < 3` OR `L[i-3] != 1`)
    2.  `i <= n - 3` AND `L[i+1] == 1` AND `L[i+2] == 1` AND (`i > n - 4` OR `L[i+3] != 1`)
*   **Verification:**
    *   **train_1:** Input `[1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]`. Output `[1,1,3,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]`.
        *   `i=2` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[0]=1`, `L[1]=1`, `i<3`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
    *   **train_2:** Input `[0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]`. Output `[3,1,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]`.
        *   `i=0` (value 0): Meets condition 2 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, `L[3]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
        *   `i=3` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, `L[0]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
        *   `i=11` (value 0): Condition 1 (`L[9]=1`, `L[10]=1`, but `L[8]=1`). Fails. Condition 2 (out of bounds). Fails. -> Stays 0. Correct.
    *   **train_3:** Input `[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. Output `[3,1,1,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`.
        *   `i=0` (value 0): Meets condition 2 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, `L[3]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
        *   `i=3` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, `L[0]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
    *   **train_4:** Input `[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. Output `[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. No '1 1' sequences. No changes. Correct.
    *   **train_5:** Input `[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`. Output `[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]`.
        *   `i=3` (value 0): Condition 1 (`L[1]=1`, `L[2]=1`, but `L[0]=1`). Fails. Condition 2 (`L[4]=0`). Fails. -> Stays 0. Correct.
    *   **train_6:** Input `[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]`. Output `[0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`.
        *   `i=6` (value 0): Meets condition 2 (`L[7]=1`, `L[8]=1`, `L[9]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
        *   `i=9` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[7]=1`, `L[8]=1`, `L[6]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
    *   **train_7:** Input `[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0]`. Output `[1,1,3,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,0,0]`.
        *   `i=2` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[0]=1`, `L[1]=1`, `i<3`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
        *   `i=6` (value 0): Meets condition 2 (`L[7]=1`, `L[8]=1`, `L[9]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.
        *   `i=9` (value 0): Meets condition 1 (`L[7]=1`, `L[8]=1`, `L[6]=0`). -> Changes to 3. Correct.

The refined rule appears consistent with all examples.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input, which is a sequence (list or array) of integers (0s and 1s). Let the input sequence be `L` and its length be `n`.
2.  Create a new sequence, `output`, initialized as a copy of the input sequence `L`.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence `L` from index `i = 0` to `n-1`.
4.  At each index `i`, check if the element `L[i]` is 0.
5.  If `L[i]` is 0, check the following two conditions:
    a.  **Preceding Pattern:** Is `i` greater than or equal to 2? And are `L[i-2]` and `L[i-1]` both equal to 1? And is it true that *either* `i` is exactly 2 OR `L[i-3]` is not equal to 1?
    b.  **Following Pattern:** Is `i` less than or equal to `n-3`? And are `L[i+1]` and `L[i+2]` both equal to 1? And is it true that *either* `i` is exactly `n-3` OR `L[i+3]` is not equal to 1?
6.  If *either* condition (5a or 5b) is met, change the element at index `i` in the `output` sequence to 3.
7.  If `L[i]` is 1, or if `L[i]` is 0 but neither condition (5a or 5b) was met, the element `output[i]` remains unchanged (it keeps the value copied from `L[i]`).
8.  After iterating through all elements, convert the `output` sequence into a string with elements separated by spaces.
9.  Return the resulting string.
