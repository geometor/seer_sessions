"""
Transformation Rule:
Accepts a sequence of integers (0s and 1s).
Iterate through the input sequence. If a digit is 0 at index 'i', check two specific conditions involving the adjacent sub-sequence '1 1':
1. Left Condition ('X 1 1 0'): The sequence ends with '1 1 0' at index 'i' (i.e., elements at i-2 and i-1 are 1), AND this '1 1' is NOT preceded by another 1 (i.e., element at i-3 is not 1, or i=2).
2. Right Condition ('0 1 1 X'): The sequence starts with '0 1 1' at index 'i' (i.e., elements at i+1 and i+2 are 1), AND this '1 1' is NOT followed by another 1 (i.e., element at i+3 is not 1, or i=n-3 where n is the length).
If either the valid Left Condition OR the valid Right Condition is true, change the 0 at index 'i' to 3 in the output sequence.
Otherwise, the digit (0 or 1) remains unchanged.
The function returns the modified sequence, typically as a list of integers.
