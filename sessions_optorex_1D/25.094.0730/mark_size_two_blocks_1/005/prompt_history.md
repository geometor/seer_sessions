Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged between input and output.
3.  **Digit Types:**
    *   Input sequences contain only '0' and '1'.
    *   Output sequences contain '0', '1', and '3'.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be changing specific '0's in the input sequence to '3's in the output sequence. The '1's remain unchanged.
5.  **Condition for Change:** Observing the examples, a '0' changes to a '3' if and only if it is immediately adjacent (either directly before or directly after) the specific two-digit sequence '1 1'.
    *   Example `... 0 1 1 ...` becomes `... 3 1 1 ...` (See train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7)
    *   Example `... 1 1 0 ...` becomes `... 1 1 3 ...` (See train_1, train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7)
6.  **No Change Cases:** If a '0' is not adjacent to a '1 1' sequence, it remains '0'. If the sequence is '1 1 1', adjacent '0's are *not* changed (See train_1, train_5).

    description: All '1's and any '0's not meeting the adjacency condition are copied directly from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Create a new sequence, initially identical to the input sequence, to store the output.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index, examining each digit.
4.  If the digit at the current index in the *input* sequence is '0':
    a.  Check if the two digits immediately *before* the current index (if they exist) form the sequence '1 1'.
    b.  Check if the two digits immediately *after* the current index (if they exist) form the sequence '1 1'.
    c.  If either check (a) or (b) is true, change the digit at the current index in the *output* sequence to '3'.
5.  If the digit at the current index in the input sequence is '1', or if it is '0' but neither adjacency check (4a, 4b) was true, keep the digit unchanged in the output sequence.
6.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, format the output sequence as a string of space-separated digits.
```python
import math

All '1's remain unchanged.

**General Assessment:**

The provided results indicate that the previous transformation logic, as implemented or reported, failed to correctly identify all instances where a '0' should be changed to a '3'. The failures occurred specifically when a '0' was adjacent to a '1 1' pattern. The successful examples (`train_4`, `train_5`, `test_1`) involve either no '0's adjacent to '1 1' or cases like `1 1 1 0` or `0 1 1 1` where the '0' should *not* change.

The errors consistently show '0' in the transformed output where '3' was expected. This suggests the core condition for changing '0' to '3' (adjacency to '1 1') was the point of failure in the previous attempt's execution or reporting.

The strategy is to refine the description of the transformation rule, ensuring the conditions for changing '0' to '3' are precisely stated, including the necessary checks for boundary conditions and the specific exclusion related to the '1 1 1' pattern. We will assume the rule derived from the initial analysis (0 changes to 3 if next to '1 1' but *not* if that '1 1' is part of '1 1 1') is correct and restate it clearly.

**Metrics:**

The following table summarizes the errors based on the comparison between the expected output and the reported transformed output from the previous attempt:

    exclusion: This check is invalid if index 'i+3' exists and the element at 'i+3' is also '1' (forming '0 1 1 1').

    description: If either the valid left neighbor pattern ('X 1 1 0' where X!=1 or start) OR the valid right neighbor pattern ('0 1 1 X' where X!=1 or end) is found, change the element at index 'i' in the output sequence to '3'.

    description: If the input digit is '1', or if it is '0' but the conditions for changing to '3' are not met, keep the original digit in the output sequence.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create an output sequence, initially identical to the input sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from the beginning to the end.
4.  At each index `i`, check if the digit in the *input* sequence is '0'.
5.  If the digit at index `i` is '0', perform the following checks:
    a.  **Check Left:** Determine if the pattern `1 1 0` ends at index `i`. This requires checking:
        i.  `i` is greater than or equal to 2.
        ii. The digit at index `i-2` in the input is '1'.
        iii. The digit at index `i-1` in the input is '1'.
        iv. **Exclusion:** This condition is only valid if *either* `i` is exactly 2 (meaning there's no digit before the '1 1') *or* the digit at index `i-3` in the input is '0'. (This prevents changing '0' in `1 1 1 0`). Let this outcome be `left_condition_met`.
    b.  **Check Right:** Determine if the pattern `0 1 1` starts at index `i`. This requires checking:
        i.  `i` is less than or equal to `length - 3` (where `length` is the total number of digits).
        ii. The digit at index `i+1` in the input is '1'.
        iii. The digit at index `i+2` in the input is '1'.
        iv. **Exclusion:** This condition is only valid if *either* `i` is exactly `length - 3` (meaning there's no digit after the '1 1') *or* the digit at index `i+3` in the input is '0'. (This prevents changing '0' in `0 1 1 1`). Let this outcome be `right_condition_met`.
    c.  **Apply Change:** If `left_condition_met` is true OR `right_condition_met` is true, change the digit at index `i` in the *output* sequence to '3'.
6.  If the digit at index `i` in the input sequence was '1', or if it was '0' but neither `left_condition_met` nor `right_condition_met` was true, the digit at index `i` in the output sequence remains unchanged (it keeps its value from the initial copy).
7.  After iterating through all indices, format the output sequence into the final required format (e.g., space-separated string or list, matching the expected output format).
