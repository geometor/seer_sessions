If a digit is 0 at index 'i', check two specific conditions involving the adjacent sub-sequence '1 1':\n1. Left Condition ('X 1 1 0'): The sequence ends with '1 1 0' at index 'i' (i.e., elements at i-2 and i-1 are 1), AND this '1 1' is NOT preceded by another 1 (i.e., element at i-3 is 0, or i=2 meaning no element exists at i-3).\n2. Right Condition ('0 1 1 X'): The sequence starts with '0 1 1' at index 'i' (i.e., elements at i+1 and i+2 are 1), AND this '1 1' is NOT followed by another 1 (i.e., element at i+3 is 0, or i=n-3 meaning no element exists at i+3).\nIf either the valid Left Condition OR the valid Right Condition is true, change the 0 at index 'i' to 3 in the output sequence.\nOtherwise, the digit (0 or 1) remains unchanged.\nThe function returns the modified sequence as a list of integers.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef transform(input_grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: A numpy array or list representing the sequence of digits (0s and 1s).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of integers representing the transformed sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure input is a mutable list\n    if isinstance(input_grid, np.ndarray):\n        input_list = input_grid.tolist()\n    else:\n        # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original input if it's a list\n        input_list = list(input_grid) \n\n    n = len(input_list)\n    # Initialize output_list as a copy of the input list\n    output_list = list(input_list)\n\n    # Iterate through the input list by index\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Only process if the current digit is 0\n        if input_list[i] == 0:\n            \n            # Initialize flags for valid conditions\n            change_to_three = False\n\n            # --- Check Left Condition ('X 1 1 0', where X is 0 or start of sequence) ---\n            # Check if there are enough elements to the left for '1 1 0'\n            if i >= 2:\n                # Check if the pattern '1 1' precedes the '0'\n                if input_list[i-2] == 1 and input_list[i-1] == 1:\n                    # Check the exclusion: ensure it's not '1 1 1 0'\n                    # Valid if it's the start ('1 1 0' at indices 0, 1, 2) OR the element before '1 1' is 0\n                    if i == 2 or input_list[i-3] == 0:\n                        change_to_three = True # Valid left condition found\n\n            # --- Check Right Condition ('0 1 1 X', where X is 0 or end of sequence) ---\n            # Only check if we haven't already decided to change based on the left condition\n            if not change_to_three:\n                # Check if there are enough elements to the right for '0 1 1'\n                if i <= n - 3:\n                    # Check if the pattern '1 1' follows the '0'\n                    if input_list[i+1] == 1 and input_list[i+2] == 1:\n                        # Check the exclusion: ensure it's not '0 1 1 1'\n                        # Valid if it's the end ('0 1 1' at indices n-3, n-2, n-1) OR the element after '1 1' is 0\n                        if i == n - 3 or input_list[i+3] == 0:\n                            change_to_three = True # Valid right condition found\n\n            # --- Apply Change ---\n            # If either valid condition was met, change the 0 to 3 in the output\n            if change_to_three:\n                output_list[i] = 3\n\n    # Return the transformed list\n    return output_list\n```"
