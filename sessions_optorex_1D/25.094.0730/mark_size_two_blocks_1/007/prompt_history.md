Okay, let's break down this task.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains unchanged between input and output.
3.  **Digit Types:**
    *   Input sequences contain only '0' and '1'.
    *   Output sequences contain '0', '1', and '3'.
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be changing specific '0's in the input sequence to '3's in the output sequence. The '1's remain unchanged.
5.  **Condition for Change:** Observing the examples, a '0' changes to a '3' if and only if it is immediately adjacent (either directly before or directly after) the specific two-digit sequence '1 1'.
    *   Example `... 0 1 1 ...` becomes `... 3 1 1 ...` (See train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7)
    *   Example `... 1 1 0 ...` becomes `... 1 1 3 ...` (See train_1, train_2, train_3, train_6, train_7)
6.  **No Change Cases:** If a '0' is not adjacent to a '1 1' sequence, it remains '0'. If the sequence is '1 1 1', adjacent '0's are *not* changed (See train_1, train_5).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list of single digits (integers 0 or 1 in input, 0, 1, or 3 in output).
    properties:
      - length: Preserved between input and output.
      - values: Primarily 0 and 1, with 3 appearing in the output under specific conditions.
objects:
  - object: digit_zero
    description: The digit '0' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - mutable: Can change to '3'.
      - condition_for_change: Must be immediately adjacent to the sub-sequence '1 1'.
  - object: digit_one
    description: The digit '1' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - immutable: Does not change.
  - object: digit_three
    description: The digit '3' appearing only in the output sequence.
    properties:
      - origin: Replaces a '0' from the input sequence.
relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: The position of a digit relative to its immediate neighbors.
    property: Crucial for determining the transformation of '0'.
  - relationship: sub-sequence
    description: A specific ordered pattern within the main sequence.
    property: The pattern '1 1' acts as a trigger for changing adjacent '0's.
actions:
  - action: identify_zeros
    description: Locate all instances of the digit '0' in the input sequence.
  - action: check_adjacency
    description: For each '0', examine the two preceding and two succeeding digits (if they exist within the sequence bounds).
  - action: detect_pattern
    description: Determine if the adjacent digits form the sequence '1 1'.
  - action: replace_zero_with_three
    description: If a '0' is adjacent to '1 1', replace it with '3' in the output sequence.
  - action: copy_unaffected_digits
    description: All '1's and any '0's not meeting the adjacency condition are copied directly from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of space-separated digits.
2.  Create a new sequence, initially identical to the input sequence, to store the output.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index, examining each digit.
4.  If the digit at the current index in the *input* sequence is '0':
    a.  Check if the two digits immediately *before* the current index (if they exist) form the sequence '1 1'.
    b.  Check if the two digits immediately *after* the current index (if they exist) form the sequence '1 1'.
    c.  If either check (a) or (b) is true, change the digit at the current index in the *output* sequence to '3'.
5.  If the digit at the current index in the input sequence is '1', or if it is '0' but neither adjacency check (4a, 4b) was true, keep the digit unchanged in the output sequence.
6.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, format the output sequence as a string of space-separated digits.
```python
import math
import re

"""
Transformation rule:
Iterate through the input sequence of digits. If a digit is '0', check if it is immediately adjacent to the sub-sequence '1 1'. Specifically, check if the pattern '1 1 0' or '0 1 1' exists at that position. If either pattern is found, change the '0' to '3' in the output sequence. Otherwise, keep the digit as it is. All '1's remain unchanged.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed to correctly transform the input sequences in most training examples. Specifically, it failed to change any '0's to '3's, indicating a fundamental flaw in the implementation of the transformation logic derived from the initial observations. The results show that the code produced output identical to the input in cases where changes were expected.

The core transformation involves changing '0's to '3's based on adjacency to the sub-sequence '1 1'. However, example `train_5` (`1 1 1 0 0...` -> `1 1 1 0 0...`) shows an exclusion: a '0' following `1 1 1` does not change. Similarly, although not explicitly shown, we can infer from `train_2` (`0 1 1 0...` -> `3 1 1 3...`) that the change *does* happen when the '1 1' is followed by a '0', implying that a potential `0 1 1 1` pattern would likely *not* cause the initial '0' to change.

The strategy is to refine the natural language program and the underlying logic to correctly capture both the transformation rule (adjacency to '1 1') and the exclusion rule (when the '1 1' is part of a '1 1 1' sequence). The code implementation must then accurately reflect this refined logic, checking boundary conditions and the specific exclusion patterns (`1 1 1 0` and inferred `0 1 1 1`).

**Metrics Analysis**

Let's gather metrics for each example to better understand the transformations.

**Observations from Metrics:**

*   Lengths are constant (12).
*   Only '0's change to '3's. The number of '1's remains constant.
*   The number of '0 -> 3' changes matches the number of '3's in the output.
*   Examples 4 and 5 show cases where no changes occur. Example 5 is key as it contains `1 1 1 0` but the '0' does not change.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
elements:
  - type: sequence
    description: A list of single digits (integers 0 or 1 in input, 0, 1, or 3 in output).
    properties:
      - length: Fixed at 12 for all provided examples, preserved between input and output.
      - values_input: Contains only 0 and 1.
      - values_output: Contains 0, 1, and 3.
objects:
  - object: digit_zero
    description: The digit '0' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - mutable: Can change to '3' under specific conditions.
      - immutable: Remains '0' if conditions are not met or if an exclusion rule applies.
  - object: digit_one
    description: The digit '1' in the sequence.
    properties:
      - immutable: Does not change value.
      - role: Acts as part of the trigger pattern '1 1' for changing adjacent '0's.
      - role_exclusion: Acts as part of the exclusion pattern '1 1 1'.
  - object: digit_three
    description: The digit '3' appearing only in the output sequence.
    properties:
      - origin: Replaces a '0' from the input sequence.
relationships:
  - relationship: adjacency
    description: The relative positioning of digits.
    property: Critical for determining the transformation of '0'. A '0' must be immediately next to a '1 1' sub-sequence.
  - relationship: sub-sequence_trigger
    description: The specific pattern '1 1'.
    property: The presence of '1 1' immediately adjacent (before or after) a '0' triggers the potential for change.
  - relationship: sub-sequence_exclusion
    description: The specific pattern '1 1 1'.
    property: If the '1 1' trigger pattern is part of a '1 1 1' sequence, the adjacent '0' is *not* changed. This means '1 1 1 0' remains unchanged, and we infer '0 1 1 1' would also remain unchanged.
actions:
  - action: iterate_sequence
    description: Process the input sequence element by element using an index.
  - action: identify_zero
    description: Check if the element at the current index is '0'.
  - action: check_left_neighbor_pattern
    description: If the current element is '0', check if the two preceding elements (at index-2 and index-1) are both '1'. Boundary conditions (index >= 2) must be checked.
  - action: check_right_neighbor_pattern
    description: If the current element is '0', check if the two succeeding elements (at index+1 and index+2) are both '1'. Boundary conditions (index <= length-3) must be checked.
  - action: check_left_exclusion
    description: If the left neighbor pattern ('1 1') is found before a '0', check if the element at index-3 is also '1'. If it is, the exclusion applies (it's a '1 1 1 0' pattern), and the '0' should not change based on this condition. Handle boundary case where index is 2 (no element at index-3).
  - action: check_right_exclusion
    description: If the right neighbor pattern ('1 1') is found after a '0', check if the element at index+3 is also '1'. If it is, the exclusion applies (it's a '0 1 1 1' pattern), and the '0' should not change based on this condition. Handle boundary case where index is length-3 (no element at index+3).
  - action: replace_zero_with_three
    description: If a '0' is found, and (the left neighbor pattern '1 1' exists AND the left exclusion does not apply) OR (the right neighbor pattern '1 1' exists AND the right exclusion does not apply), change the '0' to '3' in the output sequence.
  - action: copy_unaffected_digits
    description: All '1's, and any '0's that do not meet the transformation criteria (including those subject to exclusion rules), are copied directly from input to output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from the start (0) to the end.
3.  At each index `i`, check if the digit in the *input* sequence is '0'.
4.  If the digit is '0', determine if it should be changed to '3' based on the following conditions:
    a.  **Check Left Adjacency:** Does the pattern `1 1 0` end at index `i`? This requires checking if `i >= 2` and if `input[i-2] == 1` and `input[i-1] == 1`.
    b.  **Check Left Exclusion:** If the left adjacency pattern `1 1 0` is found, does the exclusion pattern `1 1 1 0` also end at index `i`? This requires checking if `i >= 3` and `input[i-3] == 1`. If the exclusion pattern exists, the left condition is *invalidated*.
    c.  **Check Right Adjacency:** Does the pattern `0 1 1` start at index `i`? This requires checking if `i <= length - 3` and if `input[i+1] == 1` and `input[i+2] == 1`.
    d.  **Check Right Exclusion:** If the right adjacency pattern `0 1 1` is found, does the exclusion pattern `0 1 1 1` also start at index `i`? This requires checking if `i <= length - 4` and `input[i+3] == 1`. If the exclusion pattern exists, the right condition is *invalidated*.
    e.  **Apply Change:** If (the left adjacency condition (4a) is true AND the left exclusion (4b) is false) OR (the right adjacency condition (4c) is true AND the right exclusion (4d) is false), then change the digit at index `i` in the *output* sequence to '3'.
5.  If the digit at index `i` in the input sequence is '1', or if it is '0' but the conditions in step 4e were not met, keep the digit unchanged in the output sequence.
6.  After iterating through all indices, return the modified output sequence.
