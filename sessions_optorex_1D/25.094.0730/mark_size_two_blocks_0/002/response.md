**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because it was designed to accept a space-separated string as input (`input_str.split()`) but was provided with a different data type, likely a NumPy array (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). The core transformation logic, however, appears consistent with the examples when manually verified.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input data type is an array or list of integers.
2.  Update the natural language program and the facts to reflect this input type.
3.  Ensure the program description handles boundary conditions correctly (e.g., checking indices `i-2`, `i-1`, `i+1`, `i+2` requires careful bounds checking).

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

The code failed execution on all examples due to a type error before any logic could be tested. Manual analysis of the examples against the intended logic reveals:

*   **`train_1`**: Input `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`, Output `[3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    *   Index 0 (value 0): Succeeded by `[1, 1]` (indices 1, 2). Changes to 3. **Consistent.**
    *   Index 3 (value 0): Preceded by `[1, 1]` (indices 1, 2). Changes to 3. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_2`**: Input `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`, Output `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_3`**: Input `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`, Output `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_4`**: Input `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_5`**: Input `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`, Output `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_6`**: Input `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`, Output `[1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
    *   Index 2 (value 0): Preceded by `[1, 1]` (indices 0, 1). Changes to 3. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_7`**: Input `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**

The transformation rule derived previously seems robust across all examples, provided the input type mismatch is resolved.

**Facts**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence_element
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1 initially; can become 3 in output)
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - elements: list or array of sequence_element (integers)
      - length: integer (number of elements)

relationships:
  - type: adjacency
    description: Describes the positional relationship between sequence elements.
    properties:
      - preceding_pair: The two elements immediately before the current element (at index-2 and index-1).
      - succeeding_pair: The two elements immediately after the current element (at index+1 and index+2).

actions:
  - name: check_adjacency_pattern
    description: Examine the values of elements adjacent to a specific element with value 0.
    inputs:
      - element_index: The index of the element with value 0.
      - sequence: The input sequence (list or array of integers).
    outputs:
      - boolean: True if the required adjacent pattern exists, False otherwise.
  - name: replace_value
    description: Change the value of a sequence element in a copy of the sequence.
    inputs:
      - element_index: The index of the element to change.
      - new_value: integer (specifically, 3).
      - output_sequence: The sequence being constructed.
    outputs:
      - modified_output_sequence: The sequence with the element's value updated.

conditions_for_change:
  - element_value_is_zero: The sequence element at the current index must have a value of 0.
  - pattern_match: EITHER the two preceding elements (at index-2, index-1) both exist and equal 1, OR the two succeeding elements (at index+1, index+2) both exist and equal 1.

transformation_goal:
  - Create an output sequence (list or array of integers) of the same length as the input, applying the replacement rule to all qualifying 0s, while keeping all other elements identical to the input.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept an input sequence (list or array) of integers (0s and 1s).
2.  Create an output sequence initially identical to the input sequence.
3.  Get the length of the input sequence, `n`.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from 0 up to `n-1`.
5.  For the element at the current index `i`:
    *   Check if the value of the element `input_sequence[i]` is `0`.
    *   If it is `0`:
        *   Initialize flags `precedes_11 = False` and `succeeds_11 = False`.
        *   Check preceding condition: If `i >= 2` (ensuring indices `i-1` and `i-2` are valid) AND `input_sequence[i-2] == 1` AND `input_sequence[i-1] == 1`, set `precedes_11 = True`.
        *   Check succeeding condition: If `i <= n - 3` (ensuring indices `i+1` and `i+2` are valid) AND `input_sequence[i+1] == 1` AND `input_sequence[i+2] == 1`, set `succeeds_11 = True`.
        *   If `precedes_11` is `True` OR `succeeds_11` is `True`, update the element in the *output* sequence at index `i` to `3`.
6.  After iterating through all indices, return the modified output sequence.
