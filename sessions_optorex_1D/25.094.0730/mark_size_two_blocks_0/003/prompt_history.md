**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits (0s and 1s) into another sequence of the same length. The core transformation appears to target specific `0`s based on their neighboring elements. In some examples (`train_1`, `train_6`), certain `0`s are changed to `3`s, while in others (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`, `train_5`, `train_7`), the input sequence remains unchanged in the output. The change from `0` to `3` seems conditional on the immediate context of the `0` within the sequence, specifically its relationship with adjacent `1`s. Sequences of `1`s of length other than two (e.g., single `1` or `1 1 1`) do not trigger this change.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence_element
    properties:
      - value: integer (0, 1 initially; can become 3 in output)
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)
  - name: sequence

    properties:
      - preceding_element: The element immediately before the current element.
      - succeeding_element: The element immediately after the current element.

      - succeeding_pair: The two elements immediately after the current element.

actions:
  - name: check_adjacency
    description: Examine the values of elements adjacent to a specific element.
    inputs:
      - sequence_element (specifically, one with value 0)
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - boolean (true if adjacent context meets criteria, false otherwise)
  - name: replace_value
    description: Change the value of a sequence element.
    inputs:
      - sequence_element (the one to change)
      - new_value: integer (specifically, 3)
    outputs:
      - modified_sequence_element

conditions_for_change:
  - element_value_is_zero: The sequence element's value must be 0.
  - adjacent_to_exactly_two_ones:
      - The element must be immediately preceded by the sequence `1 1`.
      - OR The element must be immediately succeeded by the sequence `1 1`.

transformation_goal:
  - Create an output sequence by applying the replacement rule to all qualifying 0s in the input sequence, while keeping all other elements unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through each element of the input sequence using its index, from the beginning to the end.
3.  For the element at the current index:
    *   Check if the element's value is `0`.
    *   If it is `0`, check its neighbors:
        *   Check if the two elements *preceding* the current index (i.e., at index-2 and index-1) both exist and have the value `1`.
        *   Check if the two elements *succeeding* the current index (i.e., at index+1 and index+2) both exist and have the value `1`.
    *   If *either* the preceding pair is `1 1` *or* the succeeding pair is `1 1`, change the value of the element at the current index in the *output* sequence to `3`.
4.  After iterating through all elements, return the modified output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed because it was designed to accept a space-separated string as input (`input_str.split()`) but was provided with a different data type, likely a NumPy array (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). The core transformation logic, however, appears consistent with the examples when manually verified.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input data type is an array or list of integers.
2.  Update the natural language program and the facts to reflect this input type.
3.  Ensure the program description handles boundary conditions correctly (e.g., checking indices `i-2`, `i-1`, `i+1`, `i+2` requires careful bounds checking).

**Metrics and Example Analysis**

The code failed execution on all examples due to a type error before any logic could be tested. Manual analysis of the examples against the intended logic reveals:

*   **`train_1`**: Input `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`, Output `[3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`
    *   Index 0 (value 0): Succeeded by `[1, 1]` (indices 1, 2). Changes to 3. **Consistent.**
    *   Index 3 (value 0): Preceded by `[1, 1]` (indices 1, 2). Changes to 3. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_2`**: Input `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`, Output `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_3`**: Input `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`, Output `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_4`**: Input `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_5`**: Input `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`, Output `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_6`**: Input `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`, Output `[1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`
    *   Index 2 (value 0): Preceded by `[1, 1]` (indices 0, 1). Changes to 3. **Consistent.**
*   **`train_7`**: Input `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   No `0` is preceded or succeeded by exactly `[1, 1]`. No changes. **Consistent.**

The transformation rule derived previously seems robust across all examples, provided the input type mismatch is resolved.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept an input sequence (list or array) of integers (0s and 1s).
2.  Create an output sequence initially identical to the input sequence.
3.  Get the length of the input sequence, `n`.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from 0 up to `n-1`.
5.  For the element at the current index `i`:
    *   Check if the value of the element `input_sequence[i]` is `0`.
