            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe initial analysis identified a transformation rule where a `0` becomes a `3` if it is adjacent to a `1 1` sequence either immediately before or immediately after it. The provided Python code (`code_00.py`) implemented a refined version of this rule, requiring the adjacent `1 1` sequence to be *exactly* two ones (i.e., not part of `1 1 1`). This refined rule correctly explains the input/output relationship in all training examples.\n\nHowever, the execution of this code resulted in a consistent error across all examples: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This specific NumPy error usually indicates that an operation expected to yield a single boolean value (for use in an `if` statement, for example) has instead produced an array of boolean values.\n\nUpon reviewing the provided `code_00.py`, the core logic involving indexing (`input_array[i]`, `arr[index-1]`, etc.) and comparisons (`==`, `!=`) should operate on single elements, returning single boolean values. The conditional logic (`if preceded or succeeded:`) also operates on single booleans. Therefore, the function's internal logic, assuming it receives a 1D sequence as input (`input_grid`), appears sound and shouldn't inherently cause this ambiguity error.\n\nThe most probable cause of the error is external to the function's definition itself:\n1.  **Test Harness Input:** The testing environment might be passing the input data (`input_grid`) to the `transform` function in an unexpected format (e.g., a nested list, a 2D array, or an object type that `np.array()` converts into something other than a simple 1D array).\n2.  **Test Harness Logic:** There might be an issue in how the test harness invokes the function or processes its return value, leading to the error message.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Maintain the refined transformation rule (0 becomes 3 if adjacent to *exactly* `1 1` preceding or succeeding it) as it fits all examples.\n2.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts to clearly state this \"exactness\" condition.\n3.  Assume the Python code logic is correct for the intended 1D sequence input. The error likely needs to be resolved in the testing environment or by ensuring the input format strictly adheres to a 1D list/array of integers before being passed to the function. No changes to the core algorithm within the `transform` function seem necessary based *only* on the provided examples and the error message's likely cause.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nBased on the analysis of the 7 training examples:\n\n*   **Input Format:** 1D sequence of integers (0s and 1s), space-separated string representation.\n*   **Output Format:** 1D sequence of integers (0s, 1s, and 3s), space-separated string representation.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Constant between input and output for each example. Length varies between examples (all examples have length 12).\n*   **Transformation Trigger:** A `0` element changes value.\n*   **Transformation Result:** The `0` becomes a `3`.\n*   **Transformation Condition:** The `0` must be immediately preceded by `X 1 1` where `X != 1` or `X` is the start boundary, OR immediately succeeded by `1 1 Y` where `Y != 1` or `Y` is the end boundary.\n*   **Examples Triggering Change:** `train_1` (changes at index 0 and 3), `train_6` (change at index 2).\n*   **Examples Not Triggering Change:** `train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`, `train_5`, `train_7`.\n*   **Error Consistency:** The \"ambiguous truth value\" error occurred for *all* examples, suggesting a systematic issue with the function call or input handling in the test environment rather than a data-dependent logic flaw.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
