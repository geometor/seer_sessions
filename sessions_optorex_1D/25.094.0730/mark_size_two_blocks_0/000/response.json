            "text": "**Perception of the Elements:**\n\nThe task involves transforming a sequence of single digits (0s and 1s) into another sequence of the same length. The core transformation appears to target specific `0`s based on their neighboring elements. In some examples (`train_1`, `train_6`), certain `0`s are changed to `3`s, while in others (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`, `train_5`, `train_7`), the input sequence remains unchanged in the output. The change from `0` to `3` seems conditional on the immediate context of the `0` within the sequence, specifically its relationship with adjacent `1`s. Sequences of `1`s of length other than two (e.g., single `1` or `1 1 1`) do not trigger this change.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
