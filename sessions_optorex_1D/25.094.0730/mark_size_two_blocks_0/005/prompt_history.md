**Perception of the Elements:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits (0s and 1s) into another sequence of the same length. The core transformation appears to target specific `0`s based on their neighboring elements. In some examples (`train_1`, `train_6`), certain `0`s are changed to `3`s, while in others (`train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`, `train_5`, `train_7`), the input sequence remains unchanged in the output. The change from `0` to `3` seems conditional on the immediate context of the `0` within the sequence, specifically its relationship with adjacent `1`s. Sequences of `1`s of length other than two (e.g., single `1` or `1 1 1`) do not trigger this change.

**Facts:**

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through each element of the input sequence using its index, from the beginning to the end.
3.  For the element at the current index:
    *   Check if the element's value is `0`.
    *   If it is `0`, check its neighbors:
        *   Check if the two elements *preceding* the current index (i.e., at index-2 and index-1) both exist and have the value `1`.
        *   Check if the two elements *succeeding* the current index (i.e., at index+1 and index+2) both exist and have the value `1`.
    *   If *either* the preceding pair is `1 1` *or* the succeeding pair is `1 1`, change the value of the element at the current index in the *output* sequence to `3`.
4.  After iterating through all elements, return the modified output sequence.

## General Assessment

The initial analysis identified a core pattern involving `0`s changing to `3`s based on adjacent `1`s. However, the execution errors ("ambiguous truth value") suggest a problem in the testing environment's handling of the function's input/output, likely related to data types (expecting a list/array of integers vs. receiving a string or nested array). More importantly, re-evaluating the examples revealed the initial rule ("preceded by `1 1` OR succeeded by `1 1`") was incomplete. Examples `train_2`, `train_3`, `train_4`, and `train_7` showed cases where a `0` was adjacent to `1 1` but did *not* change.

The critical refinement is that the adjacent `1 1` sequence must *not* be part of a longer sequence of `1`s (i.e., not `1 1 1`). The `0` must be adjacent to *exactly* the pattern `1 1`.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct the Rule:** Define the transformation rule precisely, incorporating the "exactly `1 1`" constraint.
2.  **Verify:** Confirm this refined rule applies correctly to all training examples. (Done via simulation and code execution in thought process).
3.  **Document:** Update the Facts (YAML) and Natural Language Program to reflect the refined understanding.
4.  **Address Execution Error:** While the specific execution error seems related to the testing harness rather than the core logic, the refined NL program and facts will guide the creation of a correct function implementation, assuming the input is properly parsed into a sequence of integers.

## Metrics and Verification

The following table summarizes the application of the **revised** transformation rule to each training example. The `tool_code` execution confirmed these results.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through each element of the input sequence using its index `i`, from the beginning to the end.
3.  For the element at the current index `i`:
    *   Check if the element's value is `0`.
    *   If it is `0`, then check two conditions:
        *   **Preceding Condition:** Check if the sequence `1 1` immediately precedes the element (i.e., elements at `i-2` and `i-1` are both `1`) AND that the element at `i-3` is *not* `1` (treat out-of-bounds indices as not being `1`).
        *   **Succeeding Condition:** Check if the sequence `1 1` immediately succeeds the element (i.e., elements at `i+1` and `i+2` are both `1`) AND that the element at `i+3` is *not* `1` (treat out-of-bounds indices as not being `1`).
    *   If *either* the Preceding Condition *or* the Succeeding Condition is true, change the value of the element at index `i` in the *output* sequence to `3`.
4.  After iterating through all elements, return the modified output sequence.
