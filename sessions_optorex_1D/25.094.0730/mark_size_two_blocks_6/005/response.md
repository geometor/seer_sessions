"""
Transforms a list of 0s and 1s by changing 0s adjacent to specific '1 1' patterns to 3s.
Specifically, it identifies sequences of exactly two consecutive 1s ('1 1')
that are not part of a longer sequence of 1s (i.e., not preceded or followed
by another 1). For each such identified isolated block, it changes the 0s
immediately preceding and immediately succeeding the block in the original
input list to 3s in the output list. Other elements remain unchanged.
