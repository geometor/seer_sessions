*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are both lists of single-digit integers.
    *   Input lists contain only 0s and 1s.
    *   Output lists can contain 0s, 1s, and 3s.
    *   The length of the input and output list is always the same for a given example.
    *   The transformation involves selectively changing some 0s in the input list to 3s in the output list.
    *   The change seems related to the presence of adjacent `1`s. Specifically, a pattern of exactly two consecutive `1`s (`1 1`) triggers the change.
    *   The 0s that change to 3s are those immediately preceding or immediately following such a `1 1` block.
    *   If a `1` is part of a longer sequence of `1`s (e.g., `1 1 1`), it does not trigger the change in adjacent 0s.
    *   If a `0` is adjacent to two separate `1 1` blocks, it doesn't seem to happen in the examples, but the rule implies it would still change to 3. (e.g., `1 1 0 1 1` -> `1 1 3 1 1`)

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output list as a copy of the input list.
    2.  Iterate through the input list from the first element up to the second-to-last element, examining each element and the one immediately following it. Let the current index be `i`.
    3.  Check if the element at index `i` is 1 and the element at index `i+1` is also 1.
    4.  If they are both 1, verify that this is a block of *exactly* two 1s:
        *   Check that the element *before* index `i` (if it exists, i.e., `i > 0`) is not 1.
        *   Check that the element *after* index `i+1` (if it exists, i.e., `i+1 < length - 1`) is not 1.
    5.  If both conditions in step 4 are met (it's exactly a `1 1` block):
        *   Check the element immediately *before* the block (at index `i-1`): If this element exists (`i > 0`) and its value in the *input* list is 0, change the corresponding element at index `i-1` in the *output* list to 3.
        *   Check the element immediately *after* the block (at index `i+2`): If this element exists (`i+1 < length - 1`) and its value in the *input* list is 0, change the corresponding element at index `i+2` in the *output* list to 3.
    6.  After iterating through all possible starting positions `i`, the final output list contains the transformed sequence.

Okay, let's analyze the execution results and refine the understanding of the task.

**General Assessment & Strategy**

The provided Python code attempts to implement the logic described: find isolated `1 1` blocks and change adjacent `0`s to `3`s. However, the execution results show a systematic failure:
*   Examples requiring no changes (4, 5, 6) pass.
*   Examples requiring changes (1, 2, 3, 7, and Test 1) fail, with the transformed output being identical to the input.

This pattern strongly suggests that the part of the code responsible for *modifying* the list (setting `output_list[index] = 3`) is either never reached or is ineffective. The conditions for identifying the *isolated* `1 1` block appear logically sound based on manual tracing (e.g., correctly identifying the non-isolated block in Example 5), but the modification step based on this identification seems to fail during execution.

Given the discrepancy between a manual trace appearing correct and the execution failing, the strategy is:
1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Re-confirm the interpretation of the rule: "Change 0s immediately adjacent (before or after) to a block of *exactly* two 1s (not `1 1 1`, etc.) to 3s." This interpretation seems consistent across all examples.
2.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Quantify the errors for each failed example.
3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML and Natural Language Program to be extremely precise, especially regarding the "exactly two 1s" condition and the boundary checks, even though the initial logic seemed correct. Assume the execution environment might have encountered an unexpected issue or there's a very subtle code error. The core transformation rule itself appears unchanged by the results, only that the implementation failed.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's calculate the differences for the failing examples.

import numpy as np

    size_correct = len(expected_output) == len(actual_output)

    palette_correct = all(item in expected_output for item in actual_output)
    # Check if counts of each color match
    expected_counts = {val: expected_output.count(val) for val in set(expected_output)}
    actual_counts = {val: actual_output.count(val) for val in set(actual_output)}
    count_correct = expected_counts == actual_counts

**YAML Facts**

The core understanding of the objects and actions seems correct, but emphasizing the *exactness* of the `1 1` block is crucial.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a copy of the input list; this will be the output list.
2.  Iterate through the *input* list using an index `i` from the start (`0`) up to the third-to-last position (`length - 2`), allowing examination of elements at `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.
3.  At each index `i`, check if the sequence `input_list[i], input_list[i+1]` is `[1, 1]`.
4.  If a `[1, 1]` sequence is found at `i, i+1`, determine if it is *isolated*:
    *   Check the element *before* the sequence (at index `i-1`): The sequence is isolated on the left if `i` is `0` (it's at the start) OR if `input_list[i-1]` is not `1`.
    *   Check the element *after* the sequence (at index `i+2`): The sequence is isolated on the right if `i+2` is outside the list bounds (`i+2 >= length`) OR if `input_list[i+2]` is not `1`.
5.  If the sequence at `i, i+1` is confirmed to be isolated (both left and right conditions from step 4 are met):
    *   Check the element immediately *before* the sequence (at index `i-1`): If this position is valid (`i > 0`) AND the value in the *input* list at `input_list[i-1]` is `0`, then update the *output* list at that position: `output_list[i-1] = 3`.
    *   Check the element immediately *after* the sequence (at index `i+2`): If this position is valid (`i+2 < length`) AND the value in the *input* list at `input_list[i+2]` is `0`, then update the *output* list at that position: `output_list[i+2] = 3`.
6.  Continue iterating through all possible starting positions `i`.
7.  Return the final modified output list.
