Specifically, a pattern of exactly two consecutive `1`s (`1 1`) triggers the change.\n    *   The 0s that change to 3s are those immediately preceding or immediately following such a `1 1` block.\n    *   If a `1` is part of a longer sequence of `1`s (e.g., `1 1 1`), it does not trigger the change in adjacent 0s.\n    *   If a `0` is adjacent to two separate `1 1` blocks, it doesn't seem to happen in the examples, but the rule implies it would still change to 3. (e.g., `1 1 0 1 1` -> `1 1 3 1 1`)\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
