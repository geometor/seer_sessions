However, the execution results show a systematic failure:\n*   Examples requiring no changes (4, 5, 6) pass.\n*   Examples requiring changes (1, 2, 3, 7, and Test 1) fail, with the transformed output being identical to the input.\n\nThis pattern strongly suggests that the part of the code responsible for *modifying* the list (setting `output_list[index] = 3`) is either never reached or is ineffective. The conditions for identifying the *isolated* `1 1` block appear logically sound based on manual tracing (e.g., correctly identifying the non-isolated block in Example 5), but the modification step based on this identification seems to fail during execution.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between a manual trace appearing correct and the execution failing, the strategy is:\n1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Re-confirm the interpretation of the rule: \"Change 0s immediately adjacent (before or after) to a block of *exactly* two 1s (not `1 1 1`, etc.) to 3s.\" This interpretation seems consistent across all examples.\n2.  **Gather Detailed Metrics:** Quantify the errors for each failed example.\n3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Update the YAML and Natural Language Program to be extremely precise, especially regarding the \"exactly two 1s\" condition and the boundary checks, even though the initial logic seemed correct. Assume the execution environment might have encountered an unexpected issue or there's a very subtle code error. The core transformation rule itself appears unchanged by the results, only that the implementation failed.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's calculate the differences for the failing examples.\n\n"
