```python
import copy
from typing import List

"""
Transforms a list of 0s and 1s based on the presence of isolated '1 1' blocks.
Specifically, it identifies sequences of exactly two consecutive 1s ('1 1')
that are not part of a longer sequence of 1s (i.e., not preceded or followed
by another 1). For each such identified block, it changes the 0s immediately
preceding and immediately succeeding the block to 3s in the output list.
Other elements remain unchanged.
"""

def transform(input_list: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Applies the transformation rule to the input list.

    Args:
        input_list: A list containing only 0s and 1s.

    Returns:
        A new list where 0s adjacent to isolated '1 1' blocks
        in the input list have been changed to 3s.
