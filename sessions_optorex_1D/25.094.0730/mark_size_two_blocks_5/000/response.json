Specifically, it looks for the pattern `1 1` either immediately before or immediately after the `0`.\n    *   Elements that are not 0, or 0s that do not meet the neighbor condition, remain unchanged.\n    *   The length of the sequence remains the same between input and output.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
