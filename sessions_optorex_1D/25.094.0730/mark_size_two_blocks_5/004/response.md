Okay, let's analyze the results and refine the transformation rule.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial hypothesis was that a `0` becomes `3` if it's immediately preceded by `1 1` OR immediately followed by `1 1`. The provided code attempted to implement this. However, the execution results show this code failed on multiple examples (train 1, 2, 4, 6; test 1). The failures consistently involved the code *not* changing a `0` to a `3` when the expected output indicated it should. Conversely, the code succeeded when the input sequence matched the output sequence (train 3, 5, 7), meaning it correctly *didn't* make changes in those cases.

This pattern suggests the initial rule was incomplete or slightly incorrect. The successful cases (3, 5, 7) provide clues. Let's re-examine the failing cases vs the successful ones, focusing on the context around the `0`s that *should* change vs those that *shouldn't*.

*   **Failures (0 should change, but didn't):**
    *   Ex 1 (index 2): `_ 1 1 0` -> `3`
    *   Ex 2 (index 2): `_ 1 1 0` -> `3`
    *   Ex 2 (index 4): `0 0 1 1 0` -> `3` (context `0 1 1 0`)
    *   Ex 2 (index 7): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `3` (context `1 1 0 0`)
    *   Ex 4 (index 5): `0 0 1 1 0` -> `3` (context `0 1 1 0`)
    *   Ex 4 (index 8): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `3` (context `1 1 0 0`)
    *   Ex 6 (index 5): `0 0 1 1 0` -> `3` (context `0 1 1 0`)
    *   Ex 6 (index 8): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `3` (context `1 1 0 0`)
    *   Test 1 (index 4): `0 0 1 1 0` -> `3` (context `0 1 1 0`)
    *   Test 1 (index 7): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `3` (context `1 1 0 0`)

*   **Successes (0 shouldn't change, and didn't):**
    *   Ex 1 (index 9): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `0` (context `1 1 1 0`)
    *   Ex 3 (index 3): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `0` (context `1 1 1 0`)
    *   Ex 5 (index 4): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `0` (context `1 1 1 0`)
    *   Ex 5 (index 10): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `0` (context `1 1 1 0`)
    *   Ex 7 (index 10): `1 1 1 0 0` -> `0` (context `1 1 1 0`)

**Revised Observation:** The key difference seems to be whether the `1 1` pair is part of a `1 1 1` triplet.
*   A `0` changes to `3` if preceded by `1 1` *unless* that `1 1` is preceded by another `1` (i.e., the pattern is `1 1 1 0`).
*   A `0` changes to `3` if followed by `1 1` *unless* that `1 1` is followed by another `1` (i.e., the pattern is `0 1 1 1`).

Let's test this refined rule against the examples again:
*   `1 1 0` -> `3` (Condition: Not preceded by 1, or at boundary)
*   `0 1 1` -> `3` (Condition: Not followed by 1, or at boundary)
*   `1 1 1 0` -> `0` (Condition met: preceded by 1)
*   `0 1 1 1` -> `0` (Condition met: followed by 1)

This refined rule explains all successes and failures. The previous code failed because it lacked the checks for the third `1`.

**Metrics**

The provided execution results for the previous code show the following:
*   **Train Set:** 3 successes (Ex 3, 5, 7), 4 failures (Ex 1, 2, 4, 6).
    *   Ex 1: 1 incorrect pixel (index 2).
    *   Ex 2: 3 incorrect pixels (indices 2, 4, 7).
    *   Ex 4: 2 incorrect pixels (indices 5, 8).
    *   Ex 6: 2 incorrect pixels (indices 5, 8).
*   **Test Set:** 1 failure (Ex 1).
    *   Ex 1: 2 incorrect pixels (indices 4, 7).

Total incorrect pixels across all failed examples: 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10.
The errors were consistently omissions - failing to change `0` to `3` according to the refined rule.

**Facts**
