"""
Transforms a sequence of integers (0s and 1s) by changing certain 0s to 3s.
A 0 is changed to a 3 if it is immediately preceded by exactly two 1s 
(i.e., pattern X110 where X is not 1 or is the start of the sequence) 
OR immediately followed by exactly two 1s 
(i.e., pattern 011X where X is not 1 or is the end of the sequence). 
Otherwise, elements retain their original values.

def transform(input_sequence) -> list[int]:

    Applies the refined transformation rule to the input sequence.

    Args:
        input_sequence: A list or NumPy array of integers (0s and 1s).

    Returns:
        A new list of integers where specific 0s are replaced by 3s based
        on the refined neighboring 1s rule.
