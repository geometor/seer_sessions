"""
Transforms a sequence of integers (0s and 1s) by changing certain 0s to 3s.
A 0 is changed to a 3 if it is immediately preceded by two 1s OR immediately
followed by two 1s. Otherwise, elements retain their original values.

def transform(input_sequence: list[int]) -> list[int]:

    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.

    Args:
        input_sequence: A list of integers (0s and 1s).

    Returns:
        A new list of integers where specific 0s are replaced by 3s based
        on neighboring 1s.
