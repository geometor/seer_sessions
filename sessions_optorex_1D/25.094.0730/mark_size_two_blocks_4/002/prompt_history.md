*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits.
    *   The digits observed in the input are `0` and `1`.
    *   The digits observed in the output are `0`, `1`, and `3`.
    *   The transformation appears to involve identifying specific patterns in the input sequence and modifying adjacent elements.
    *   The core pattern triggering a change seems to be the consecutive sequence `1 1`.
    *   Digits `0` adjacent to this `1 1` sequence are changed to `3` in the output.
    *   Digits `1` remain unchanged.
    *   Digits `0` not adjacent to a `1 1` sequence remain unchanged.
    *   Sequences like `1 1 1` do not trigger the change.

*   **YAML Facts:**

    patterns:
      - name: target_sequence
        value: [1, 1]
        description: The specific sequence of two '1's that triggers modifications.
      - name: modified_element
        value: 0
        description: The element that gets changed if adjacent to the target_sequence.
      - name: result_element
        value: 3
        description: The element that replaces '0' when the condition is met.
    relationships:
      - type: adjacency
        description: The modification depends on a '0' being immediately before or immediately after the 'target_sequence'.
    actions:
      - name: conditional_replacement
        description: Replace '0' with '3' based on adjacency to 'target_sequence'.
        conditions:
          - element_is_zero: The element must be '0'.
          - is_adjacent_before: The element is immediately before a '1 1' sequence.
          - is_adjacent_after: The element is immediately after a '1 1' sequence.
        outcome: Element becomes '3'.
      - name: identity_copy
        description: Elements not meeting replacement conditions are copied unchanged.
        conditions:
          - element_is_one: The element is '1'.
          - element_is_zero_non_adjacent: The element is '0' but not adjacent to a '1 1' sequence.
        outcome: Element remains unchanged.
    invariants:
      - The sequence length remains the same.
      - The digits '1' are never modified.
      - The relative order of '1's is preserved.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
    2.  Iterate through the input sequence from the first element up to the second-to-last element. Let the current index be `i`.
    3.  Check if the element at index `i` and the element at index `i+1` form the sequence `1 1`.
    4.  If the sequence `1 1` is found at indices `i` and `i+1`:
        a.  Check the element at index `i-1` (the element *before* the `1 1` sequence): If index `i-1` is valid (i.e., `i > 0`) and the element in the *input* sequence at `i-1` is `0`, change the element in the *output* sequence at index `i-1` to `3`.
        b.  Check the element at index `i+2` (the element *after* the `1 1` sequence): If index `i+2` is valid (i.e., `i+2 < length of sequence`) and the element in the *input* sequence at `i+2` is `0`, change the element in the *output* sequence at index `i+2` to `3`.
    5.  After iterating through all possible starting positions `i`, the resulting output sequence is the final result. Note that checks and modifications are based on the original input sequence to avoid cascading effects within a single transformation step.
```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 1s based on the '1 1' pattern.

Specifically, iterates through the input sequence. If a consecutive '1 1' pattern 
is found starting at index i, it checks the elements immediately before (index i-1) 
and immediately after (index i+2) the pattern in the original input sequence. 
If the element before the pattern is '0', it's changed to '3' in the output. 
If the element after the pattern is '0', it's changed to '3' in the output. 
All other elements ('1's and '0's not adjacent to a '1 1' pattern) 
remain unchanged. Changes are based on the original input to prevent cascading effects.
