            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided execution results indicate a consistent error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This typically occurs when a boolean operation is attempted on a NumPy array containing multiple elements, often in an `if` condition. This suggests that the testing environment might be passing the input as a NumPy array instead of the standard Python list the function `transform` expects, or that some operation within the function (perhaps inadvertently due to library interactions not shown) is creating a NumPy array where a single boolean value is expected.\n\nHowever, the task is to refine the *natural language program* based on the *examples*, assuming the underlying transformation logic might need adjustment. A detailed re-examination of all training examples reveals that the initial logic derived (\"change 0 to 3 if and only if it is immediately adjacent to an *isolated* block of exactly two 1s\") holds true for all provided pairs. The examples involving `1 1 1` (train_4) correctly show no changes to adjacent 0s, and edge cases (train_6) are handled correctly by the rule.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to refine the natural language program for clarity and precision based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples, while acknowledging that the reported execution error is likely unrelated to the core logic itself but rather to data type handling or the testing environment setup.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze each example to confirm the pattern:\n\n*   **train_1:**\n    *   Input: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Output: `[1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Changes: `input[3] == 0` -> `output[3] == 3`; `input[6] == 0` -> `output[6] == 3`\n    *   Trigger: `input[4:6] == [1, 1]`. `input[3]` is left neighbour, `input[6]` is right neighbour. `input[2] == 0` and `input[7] == 0`, so the `1 1` block is isolated.\n*   **train_2:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Changes: None.\n    *   Trigger: No `1 1` sequence present.\n*   **train_3:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Changes: `input[2] == 0` -> `output[2] == 3`; `input[5] == 0` -> `output[5] == 3`\n    *   Trigger: `input[3:5] == [1, 1]`. `input[2]` is left neighbour, `input[5]` is right neighbour. `input[1] == 0` and `input[6] == 0`, so the `1 1` block is isolated.\n*   **train_4:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Changes: None.\n    *   Trigger: `input[7:10] == [1, 1, 1]`. This is not a `1 1` block. `input[6]` and `input[10]` are 0 but not adjacent to an *isolated* `1 1`.\n*   **train_5:**\n    *   Input: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Output: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Changes: None.\n    *   Trigger: No `1 1` sequence present.\n*   **train_6:**\n    *   Input: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Output: `[1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Changes: `input[2] == 0` -> `output[2] == 3`\n    *   Trigger: `input[0:2] == [1, 1]`. `input[2]` is right neighbour. Block is at the start, so implicitly isolated on the left. `input[3] == 0`, isolated on the right.\n*   **train_7:**\n    *   Input: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Output: `[0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]` (len 12)\n    *   Changes: `input[2] == 0` -> `output[2] == 3`; `input[5] == 0` -> `output[5] == 3`\n    *   Trigger: `input[3:5] == [1, 1]`. `input[2]` is left neighbour, `input[5]` is right neighbour. `input[1] == 0` and `input[6] == 0`, so the `1 1` block is isolated.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
