Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The input is a sequence of binary digits (0s and 1s). The output is a sequence of the same length, containing digits 0, 1, and 3. The transformation modifies some of the 0s in the input sequence to 3s in the output sequence, while the 1s remain unchanged. The modification rule for the 0s depends on their context, specifically their neighboring values. By comparing the input and output pairs, a pattern emerges: 0s are changed to 3s only when they are immediately adjacent to a sequence of exactly two consecutive 1s (`1 1`). Sequences of three or more consecutive 1s (`1 1 1`) do not trigger this change in their adjacent 0s.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: list
  element_type: int
  values: [0, 1]
Output:
  type: list
  element_type: int
  values: [0, 1, 3]
  length: Same as input length
Transformation:
  type: Conditional element replacement
  target_element_value: 0
  replacement_value: 3
  condition:
    description: The '0' element must be immediately adjacent (left or right neighbor) to a block of exactly two consecutive '1's.
    pattern_trigger: '1 1'
    pattern_negation: The '1 1' block cannot be part of a longer sequence of '1's (e.g., '1 1 1').
    examples:
      - '0 1 1 0' -> '0 1 1 3' (change right 0)
      - '0 1 1 0' -> '3 1 1 0' (change left 0)
      - '0 1 1 1 0' -> '0 1 1 1 0' (no change)
      - '1 1 0' -> '1 1 3' (change 0)
      - '0 1 1' -> '3 1 1' (change 0)
  unmodified_elements:
    - All '1's from the input remain '1's in the output.
    - '0's not meeting the adjacency condition remain '0's.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through each element of the input sequence using its index, `i`.
3.  If the element `input[i]` is `0`:
    *   Check if this `0` is immediately to the right of an isolated `1 1` block: This occurs if `i >= 2`, `input[i-1]` is `1`, `input[i-2]` is `1`, AND (`i == 2` OR `input[i-3]` is not `1`). If these conditions are met, change the element at index `i` in the output sequence to `3`.
    *   Check if this `0` is immediately to the left of an isolated `1 1` block: This occurs if `i <= length(input) - 3`, `input[i+1]` is `1`, `input[i+2]` is `1`, AND (`i == length(input) - 3` OR `input[i+3]` is not `1`). If these conditions are met, change the element at index `i` in the output sequence to `3`.
4.  If the element `input[i]` is `1`, keep the corresponding element in the output sequence as `1`.
5.  Return the modified output sequence.
