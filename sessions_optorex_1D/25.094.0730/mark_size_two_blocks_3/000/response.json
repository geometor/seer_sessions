The output is a sequence of the same length, containing digits 0, 1, and 3. The transformation modifies some of the 0s in the input sequence to 3s in the output sequence, while the 1s remain unchanged. The modification rule for the 0s depends on their context, specifically their neighboring values. By comparing the input and output pairs, a pattern emerges: 0s are changed to 3s only when they are immediately adjacent to a sequence of exactly two consecutive 1s (`1 1`). Sequences of three or more consecutive 1s (`1 1 1`) do not trigger this change in their adjacent 0s.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
