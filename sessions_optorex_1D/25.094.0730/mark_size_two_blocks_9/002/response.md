*   **General Assessment:**
    The analysis indicates that the previous code failed universally due to an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The code expected a string input that required parsing (`.strip()`, `.split()`), while the execution environment provided the input directly as a NumPy array (or similar sequence type like a list). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this mismatch. The underlying transformation logic (identifying blocks of exactly two `1`s and modifying adjacent `0`s to `3`s) appears sound based on a manual review of the examples. The strategy is to remove the string parsing and formatting layers and modify the core function to directly accept and return a list or array of integers.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Input Type:** Assumed `string` (incorrect), Actual `numpy.ndarray` (or similar integer sequence).
    *   **Output Type:** Assumed `string` (incorrect), Actual `numpy.ndarray` (or similar integer sequence).
    *   **Execution Status:** All 7 training examples failed during the input parsing stage.
    *   **Error Type:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` occurred in all 7 cases.
    *   **Transformation Logic Execution:** The core transformation logic was never reached due to the input type error.
    *   **Example 1 Analysis:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`, Output `[0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`. Expected changes at indices 2 and 5 due to the `1 1` block at indices 3-4. No changes around the `1 1 1` block at 8-10. Logic seems correct.
    *   **Example 5 Analysis:** Input `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]`. Expected changes at indices 0, 3, 5, 8 due to `1 1` blocks at 1-2 and 6-7. Logic seems correct.
    *   **Other Examples Analysis:** Examples 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 contain no blocks of exactly two `1`s, and correspondingly, their outputs are identical to their inputs. This further supports the core logic.

    objects:
      - sequence:
          description: A list or array of integers representing the input or output state.
          properties:

            - length: The number of elements in the sequence.
      - number:
          description: An integer element within the sequence.
          properties:
            - value: The integer itself (0, 1, or 3).
            - position: The zero-based index of the number within the sequence.
      - block:
          description: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical numbers.
          properties:
            - type: Consists of the number 1.
            - length: The count of consecutive 1s. Must be exactly 2 for the transformation rule to apply.
            - location: Starting and ending indices within the sequence.
    relationships:
      - adjacency:
          description: A number's position is immediately before the start index or immediately after the end index of a specific block.
          applies_to: [number, block]

          description: Iterate through the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks consisting of exactly two 1s (i.e., sequence `[..., 0, 1, 1, 0, ...]` or at sequence boundaries like `[1, 1, 0, ...]` or `[..., 0, 1, 1]`). Record the starting index `i` of each such block (where `input[i] == 1` and `input[i+1] == 1`).
      - check_adjacency_and_boundary:
          description: For each identified block of exactly two 1s starting at index `i`:
                       a. Check the element at index `i-1` (if `i > 0`).

      - modify_number:
          description: If an adjacent element exists and its value is 0, change its value to 3 in the output sequence.
          condition: The 0 must be at index `i-1` or `i+2` relative to a block of exactly two 1s starting at `i`.
          target: The output sequence (initially a copy of the input sequence).
      - copy_number:
          description: If a number is not modified by the `modify_number` action, its value remains unchanged from the input to the output at the same position.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input as a sequence (list or array) of integers.
    2.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial output sequence.
    3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` from the beginning up to the second-to-last element.
    4.  At each index `i`, check if the element `input[i]` is 1 and the next element `input[i+1]` is also 1.
    5.  If a `[1, 1]` pair is found at indices `i` and `i+1`, verify that this block consists of *exactly* two 1s by checking:
        a.  The element *before* the block (at index `i-1`) is not 1 (must be 0 or out of bounds). This condition is `i == 0 or input[i-1] != 1`.
        b.  The element *after* the block (at index `i+2`) is not 1 (must be 0 or out of bounds). This condition is `i + 2 >= length or input[i+2] != 1`.
    6.  If both boundary conditions (5a and 5b) are met (confirming it's exactly two 1s):
        a.  Check the element at index `i-1`. If `i > 0` (i.e., the index is valid) and `input[i-1]` is 0, change the element at index `i-1` in the *output* sequence to 3.
        b.  Check the element at index `i+2`. If `i + 2 < length` (i.e., the index is valid) and `input[i+2]` is 0, change the element at index `i+2` in the *output* sequence to 3.
    7.  After iterating through all possible starting indices `i`, return the final modified output sequence.
