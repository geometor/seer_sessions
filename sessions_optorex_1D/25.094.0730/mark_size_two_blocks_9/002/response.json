            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The analysis indicates that the previous code failed universally due to an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The code expected a string input that required parsing (`.strip()`, `.split()`), while the execution environment provided the input directly as a NumPy array (or similar sequence type like a list). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this mismatch. The underlying transformation logic (identifying blocks of exactly two `1`s and modifying adjacent `0`s to `3`s) appears sound based on a manual review of the examples. The strategy is to remove the string parsing and formatting layers and modify the core function to directly accept and return a list or array of integers.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** Assumed `string` (incorrect), Actual `numpy.ndarray` (or similar integer sequence).\n    *   **Output Type:** Assumed `string` (incorrect), Actual `numpy.ndarray` (or similar integer sequence).\n    *   **Execution Status:** All 7 training examples failed during the input parsing stage.\n    *   **Error Type:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` occurred in all 7 cases.\n    *   **Transformation Logic Execution:** The core transformation logic was never reached due to the input type error.\n    *   **Example 1 Analysis:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`, Output `[0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]`. Expected changes at indices 2 and 5 due to the `1 1` block at indices 3-4. No changes around the `1 1 1` block at 8-10. Logic seems correct.\n    *   **Example 5 Analysis:** Input `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, Output `[3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]`. Expected changes at indices 0, 3, 5, 8 due to `1 1` blocks at 1-2 and 6-7. Logic seems correct.\n    *   **Other Examples Analysis:** Examples 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 contain no blocks of exactly two `1`s, and correspondingly, their outputs are identical to their inputs. This further supports the core logic.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
