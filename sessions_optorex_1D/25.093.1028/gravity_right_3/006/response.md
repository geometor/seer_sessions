*   **General Assessment:**
    The initial code (`code_00.py`) failed because it incorrectly assumed the input was a single string of space-separated numbers. The error messages (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...`) confirm that it was trying to parse the *expected output string* as if it were the input, indicating a fundamental mismatch in input type handling. The subsequent code versions (`code_01.py` and `code_02.py`, including the "Previous Code" block) correctly identify the input as a NumPy array (`input_arr: np.ndarray`) and implement the required transformation logic: partitioning the array into zeros and non-zeros, concatenating them with zeros first, and preserving the relative order of the non-zeros. The use of `.flatten()` in the final version ensures it works even if the input array is multi-dimensional, although all examples provided appear to be 1D. The core transformation logic seems sound and matches the pattern observed across all examples. The strategy is to confirm this logic holds and refine the documentation (YAML facts and natural language program) based on the NumPy array input type.

*   **Metrics and Verification:**
    Let's analyze `train_1` to verify the assumptions:
    Input: `[0 8 2 0 5 7 0 0 9 0 6 0]`
    Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 5 7 9 6`

    *   Input Length: 12
    *   Output Length: 12 (matches input)
    *   Zeros in Input: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Count: 6)
    *   Non-zeros in Input (relative order): `[8, 2, 5, 7, 9, 6]`
    *   Zeros in Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (Count: 6)
    *   Non-zeros in Output (relative order): `[8, 2, 5, 7, 9, 6]`

    The counts match, and the relative order of non-zeros `(8, 2, 5, 7, 9, 6)` is preserved.

    Let's use `tool_code` to programmatically verify this for `train_2`:
    Input: `[1 0 6 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 7]`
    Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 9 7 7`

``` python
import numpy as np

input_arr = np.array([1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7])
expected_output_str = "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 9 7 7"

# Verify lengths
input_len = len(input_arr)
output_len = len(expected_output_str.split())
print(f"{input_len=}")
print(f"{output_len=}")
print(f"Lengths match: {input_len == output_len}")

# Verify zero count
zero_count_input = np.count_nonzero(input_arr == 0)
zero_count_output = expected_output_str.split().count('0')
print(f"{zero_count_input=}")
print(f"{zero_count_output=}")
print(f"Zero counts match: {zero_count_input == zero_count_output}")

# Verify non-zero relative order
non_zeros_input = input_arr[input_arr != 0]
non_zeros_output_str = [s for s in expected_output_str.split() if s != '0']
non_zeros_output = np.array([int(s) for s in non_zeros_output_str])

print(f"Non-zeros in input (order preserved): {non_zeros_input.tolist()}")
print(f"Non-zeros in output (order preserved): {non_zeros_output.tolist()}")
print(f"Non-zero relative order preserved: {np.array_equal(non_zeros_input, non_zeros_output)}")

# Verify overall composition
zeros_list = [0] * zero_count_input
combined = zeros_list + non_zeros_input.tolist()
combined_str = " ".join(map(str, combined))
print(f"Constructed output: {combined_str}")
print(f"Matches expected output: {combined_str == expected_output_str}")
```
```
input_len=12
output_len=12
Lengths match: True
zero_count_input=7
zero_count_output=7
Zero counts match: True
Non-zeros in input (order preserved): [1, 6, 9, 7, 7]
Non-zeros in output (order preserved): [1, 6, 9, 7, 7]
Non-zero relative order preserved: True
Constructed output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 9 7 7
Matches expected output: True

```
The verification confirms the transformation logic: separate zeros and non-zeros, place zeros first, append non-zeros while maintaining their original relative order, and format as a space-separated string. The input type is confirmed to be processable as a NumPy array.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input NumPy array (`input_arr`).
    2.  Flatten the `input_arr` into a one-dimensional sequence to handle any input dimensionality consistently.
    3.  Create two new empty lists: `zeros_list` and `non_zeros_list`.
    4.  Iterate through each element in the flattened sequence:
        *   If the element is equal to 0, append it to `zeros_list`.
        *   If the element is not equal to 0, append it to `non_zeros_list`.
    5.  Concatenate `zeros_list` and `non_zeros_list` in that order to create the `ordered_list`.
    6.  Convert each integer element in the `ordered_list` to its string representation.
    7.  Join the string representations using a single space (" ") as a separator to form the `output_string`.
    8.  Return the `output_string`.
