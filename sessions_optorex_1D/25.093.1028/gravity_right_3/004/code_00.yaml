task_description: "Reorder the elements of an input integer NumPy array."
input_elements:
  - type: numpy_array
    description: "A NumPy array containing integers, potentially multi-dimensional but conceptually representing a sequence."
    item_type: integer (0-9)
output_elements:
  - type: string
    description: "A string containing the reordered integers from the input array, separated by spaces."
    item_type: character (digits and spaces)
objects:
  - name: input_array
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers
      - shape: tuple (e.g., (N,), (1, N), (N, 1), (R, C))
  - name: flattened_sequence
    properties:
      - derived_from: input_array
      - elements: list of integers (order based on standard flattening, e.g., row-major)
      - length: integer (total number of elements in input_array)
  - name: zero_elements
    properties:
      - subset_of: flattened_sequence
      - value: 0
      - count: integer
  - name: non_zero_elements
    properties:
      - subset_of: flattened_sequence
      - value: range(1, 10)
      - count: integer
      - relative_order: maintained from flattened_sequence
  - name: output_sequence
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers (concatenation of zeros then non-zeros)
      - length: integer (same as flattened_sequence)
  - name: output_string
    properties:
      - derived_from: output_sequence
      - format: space-separated string representation of integers
relationships:
  - type: equivalence
    description: "The multiset of numbers in the flattened input array is identical to the multiset in the output sequence."
  - type: ordering
    description: "All zero elements from the flattened input appear first in the output sequence."
  - type: ordering
    description: "All non-zero elements from the flattened input appear after the zeros in the output sequence."
  - type: relative_ordering
    description: "The relative order of the non-zero elements in the output sequence is the same as their relative order in the flattened input sequence."

  - name: partition
    description: "Separate the flattened sequence into two lists: one containing only zeros and one containing non-zeros, preserving the relative order of non-zeros."
  - name: concatenate
