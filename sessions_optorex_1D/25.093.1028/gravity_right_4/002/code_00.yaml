Input_Object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  description: A list or 1D array containing zero and non-zero integer values.
  properties:
    - variable number of zeros
    - variable number of non-zeros
    - fixed length within a single example (e.g., 12 in all training examples)
    - relative order of non-zero elements is significant

Output_Object:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer
  description: A list or 1D array representing the rearranged input.
  properties:
    - same length as the input sequence
    - contains the exact same multiset of integers as the input
    - starts with a contiguous block of all zero elements from the input
    - ends with a contiguous block of all non-zero elements from the input
    - the relative order of the non-zero elements in the output block matches their relative order in the input sequence

Transformation_Action:
  name: partition_and_rearrange
  description: Separates the input sequence into two groups (zeros and non-zeros) and concatenates them in a specific order.
  steps:
    1. Identify zero elements.
    2. Identify non-zero elements, preserving their original relative sequence.
    3. Construct the output sequence by placing all identified zeros first, followed by the sequence of identified non-zero elements.
  constraints:
    - Preservation of non-zero relative order is mandatory.
    - The total count of elements remains unchanged.
    - The count of zero elements remains unchanged.

Implicit_Assumption (based on error):
  - The execution environment might provide the input as a data type (e.g., NumPy array) that requires careful handling during element-wise comparison, even if the conceptual input is a simple list.
