**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves rearranging a sequence of integers. The input consists of a list of integers, containing both zeros and non-zero values. The output is a list of the same length, where all the zero elements from the input are moved to the beginning of the list, and all the non-zero elements are moved to the end, preserving their original relative order.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: integers
  properties:
    - contains zeros
    - contains non-zero integers
    - fixed length (e.g., 12 in examples)

Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: integers
  properties:
    - same length as input
    - same multiset of elements as input (same numbers, same counts)
    - structured arrangement

Transformation:
  action: rearrange elements
  rule: partition based on value (zero vs. non-zero)
  constraints:
    - relative order of non-zero elements is preserved
    - all zeros are grouped together at the beginning
    - all non-zeros are grouped together at the end

Relationships:
  - Input element maps to an output element.
  - The position of an element in the output depends on its value (zero or non-zero) and its original position relative to other non-zero elements.
  - The count of zeros in the input equals the count of leading zeros in the output.
  - The sequence of non-zero elements in the input is identical to the sequence of trailing non-zero elements in the output.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input sequence of integers.
2.  Create a new, empty sequence to store the non-zero elements, maintaining their original relative order.
3.  Initialize a counter for the number of zero elements to zero.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence:
    a.  If the current element is zero, increment the zero counter.
    b.  If the current element is non-zero, append it to the sequence of non-zero elements.
5.  Construct the final output sequence:
    a.  Start with a sequence consisting of the counted number of zeros.
    b.  Append the sequence of collected non-zero elements to the end of the zero sequence.
6.  Return the constructed output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The provided code implements the logic described in the initial natural language program: moving all zeros to the beginning of a sequence while preserving the relative order of non-zero elements. The error message, "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous," occurring consistently across all examples, indicates that the `transform` function is not receiving the input as a flat list or 1D NumPy array of integers as expected. Instead, it appears to be receiving a multi-dimensional NumPy array (perhaps the input string was parsed into a grid or matrix format by the testing environment before being passed to the function).

The core logic of partitioning based on zero/non-zero values seems correct based on the visual transformation shown in the examples. The strategy is to:
1.  Re-affirm that the task operates on a **flat, 1D sequence** of integers.
2.  Update the documentation (YAML, natural language program, code comments) to explicitly state this assumption about the input format.
3.  The code itself is likely correct *if* it receives the input in the expected 1D format. The issue lies in the data preparation step before the function call within the testing framework, which is outside the scope of the `transform` function's definition but crucial for its execution. We will proceed assuming the input *should* be a 1D sequence.
4.  Gather metrics based on the 1D interpretation of the input/output strings.

Execution Issue:
  - The previous code execution failed with a type error ("The truth value of an array... is ambiguous").
  - This suggests the `transform` function was called with a multi-dimensional array or incompatible type, despite the task description implying a 1D sequence operation.
  - The core partitioning logic remains valid for 1D sequences.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input **flat sequence** (e.g., a list or 1D array) of integers.
2.  Create two new, empty sequences: one for storing zeros (`zeros_list`) and one for storing non-zero elements (`non_zeros_list`).
3.  Iterate through the input sequence, element by element:
    a.  If the current element is exactly equal to zero, append it to the `zeros_list`.
    b.  If the current element is not equal to zero, append it to the `non_zeros_list`.
4.  Construct the final output sequence by concatenating the `zeros_list` and the `non_zeros_list`, in that order.
5.  Return the constructed output sequence.
