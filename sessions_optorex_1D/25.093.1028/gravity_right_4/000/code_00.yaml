Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: integers
  properties:
    - contains zeros
    - contains non-zero integers
    - fixed length (e.g., 12 in examples)

Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: integers
  properties:
    - same length as input
    - same multiset of elements as input (same numbers, same counts)
    - structured arrangement

Transformation:
  action: rearrange elements
  rule: partition based on value (zero vs. non-zero)
  constraints:
    - relative order of non-zero elements is preserved
    - all zeros are grouped together at the beginning
    - all non-zeros are grouped together at the end

Relationships:
  - Input element maps to an output element.
  - The position of an element in the output depends on its value (zero or non-zero) and its original position relative to other non-zero elements.
  - The count of zeros in the input equals the count of leading zeros in the output.
  - The sequence of non-zero elements in the input is identical to the sequence of trailing non-zero elements in the output.
