objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[Integer] or numpy.ndarray[Integer] # Updated type
    description: A sequence (likely array) of single-digit integers provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[Integer] or numpy.ndarray[Integer] # Updated type
    description: A sequence (likely array) of single-digit integers representing the transformed output.
  - name: zero_digit
    type: Integer
    value: 0
    description: The digit '0'.

    type: Integer
    value_range: 1-9
    description: Any digit from '1' to '9'.

properties:
  - object: input_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of digits in the input sequence.
  - object: output_sequence
    property: length
    description: The number of digits in the output sequence (equal to input length).

    description: The order in which non-zero digits appear relative to each other in the sequence.

actions:
  # Removed parse_input and format_output
  - name: partition_digits
    input: input_sequence
    outputs: [list_of_zeros, list_of_non_zeros]
    description: Iterate through the input sequence, separating digits into two lists based on whether they are zero or non-zero, preserving the original relative order within the non-zero list.
  - name: concatenate_lists
    inputs: [list_of_zeros, list_of_non_zeros]
    output: output_sequence
    description: Combine the list of zeros and the list of non-zeros to form the final output sequence.

relationships:
  - type: equality
    between: [input_sequence.length, output_sequence.length]
    description: The input and output sequences have the same number of elements.
  - type: preservation
    element: non_zero_digit
    property: relative_order
    description: The relative order of non-zero digits in the input_sequence is the same as their relative order in the output_sequence.
  - type: composition
    result: output_sequence
    components: [list_of_zeros, list_of_non_zeros]
    description: The output sequence is formed by appending the list of non-zeros to the list of zeros.
