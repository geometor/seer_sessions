**Perception of task elements:**

The input and output are both sequences of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings. The length of the input sequence is always the same as the length of the output sequence (12 in all provided examples). The core transformation involves rearranging the elements of the input sequence. Specifically, all the '0' digits are moved to the beginning of the sequence, while all the non-zero digits are moved to the end. Importantly, the relative order of the non-zero digits amongst themselves is preserved from the input to the output.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a string of space-separated digits.
2.  Convert this input string into a list of integer digits.
3.  Create a new list containing only the non-zero digits from the input list, maintaining their original relative order.
4.  Count the number of zero digits in the input list.
5.  Create the output list by first adding the counted number of zeros, and then appending the list of non-zero digits (created in step 3).
6.  Convert the resulting output list back into a string of space-separated digits.
