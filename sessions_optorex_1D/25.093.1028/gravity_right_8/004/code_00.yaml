objects:
  - name: input_string
    type: string
    description: A single string containing digits separated by spaces.
    properties:
      - content: Consists of digit characters ('0'-'9') and space separators.
      - structure: Represents a sequence of digits.
  - name: output_string
    type: string
    description: A single string containing digits separated by spaces, representing the transformed sequence.
    properties:
      - content: Consists of the same multiset of digits as the input_string, rearranged.
      - structure: All '0' digits appear first, followed by non-zero digits in their original relative order.
  - name: digit_list
    type: list of strings
    description: An intermediate representation of the input digits after splitting the input_string.
    properties:
      - elements: Each element is a string representing a single digit ('0'-'9').
  - name: zeros_list
    type: list of strings
    description: A list containing only the '0' digit strings from the input.
  - name: non_zeros_list
    type: list of strings
    description: A list containing the non-zero digit strings from the input, preserving their original relative order.

actions:
  - name: split_string
    description: Convert the input_string into a digit_list by splitting it at the spaces.
  - name: filter_digits
    description: Iterate through the digit_list, populating the zeros_list and non_zeros_list.
  - name: concatenate_lists
    description: Create a new list by appending the non_zeros_list to the end of the zeros_list.
  - name: join_list
    description: Convert the concatenated list back into a single space-separated output_string.

relationships:
  - type: preservation
    description: The relative order of digits in the non_zeros_list is identical to their relative order in the original input_string.
  - type: partitioning
    description: The digit_list is partitioned into the zeros_list and the non_zeros_list.
  - type: ordering
    description: In the final output_string, all '0' digits precede all non-zero digits.
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each digit ('0' through '9') is the same in the input_string and the output_string.
