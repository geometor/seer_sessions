Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are sequences of digits, represented as space-separated strings.
*   Each input and output sequence in the examples has a length of 12 digits.
*   The core operation appears to be rearranging the digits from the input to form the output.
*   The digit '0' seems to play a special role. In all output examples, all the '0's from the input are grouped together at the beginning.
*   The non-zero digits from the input appear in the output after all the '0's.
*   Crucially, the relative order of the non-zero digits amongst themselves seems to be preserved from the input to the output. For example, in `train_1`, the non-zero digits are `2, 3, 2, 3, 4` in that order in the input, and they appear as `2 3 2 3 4` at the end of the output.

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of digits (derived from space-separated string)
    properties:
      - length (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains digits 0-9
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of digits (formatted as space-separated string)
    properties:
      - length (same as input)
      - contains the same multiset of digits as input
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    value: 0
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    value: 1-9

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    description: Convert the input string into a list of digits.
  - name: filter_zeros
    description: Identify and collect all '0' digits from the input list.
  - name: filter_non_zeros
    description: Identify and collect all non-zero digits from the input list, maintaining their original relative order.
  - name: concatenate_sequences
    description: Combine the collected '0' digits followed by the collected non-zero digits.
  - name: format_output
    description: Join the digits in the combined sequence with spaces to create the output string.

relationships:
  - type: preservation
    description: The relative order of non-zero digits in the input_sequence is maintained in the non-zero part of the output_sequence.
  - type: partitioning
    description: The input_sequence is partitioned into zero_digits and non_zero_digits.
  - type: ordering
    description: In the output_sequence, all zero_digits precede all non_zero_digits.
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each specific digit (0-9) is the same in the input_sequence and the output_sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and convert it into a list of individual digits.
2.  Create an empty list called `zeros` to store the '0' digits.
3.  Create an empty list called `non_zeros` to store the non-zero digits.
4.  Iterate through the input list of digits:
    *   If the current digit is '0', add it to the `zeros` list.
    *   If the current digit is not '0', add it to the `non_zeros` list.
5.  Combine the `zeros` list and the `non_zeros` list, in that order, to form the rearranged list of digits.
6.  Convert the rearranged list of digits back into a space-separated string for the final output.
