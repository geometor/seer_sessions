objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of digits (derived from space-separated string)
    properties:
      - length (e.g., 12 in examples)
      - contains digits 0-9
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of digits (formatted as space-separated string)
    properties:
      - length (same as input)
      - contains the same multiset of digits as input
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    value: 0
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    value: 1-9

actions:
  - name: parse_input
    description: Convert the input string into a list of digits.
  - name: filter_zeros
    description: Identify and collect all '0' digits from the input list.
  - name: filter_non_zeros
    description: Identify and collect all non-zero digits from the input list, maintaining their original relative order.
  - name: concatenate_sequences
    description: Combine the collected '0' digits followed by the collected non-zero digits.
  - name: format_output
    description: Join the digits in the combined sequence with spaces to create the output string.

relationships:
  - type: preservation
    description: The relative order of non-zero digits in the input_sequence is maintained in the non-zero part of the output_sequence.
  - type: partitioning
    description: The input_sequence is partitioned into zero_digits and non_zero_digits.
  - type: ordering
    description: In the output_sequence, all zero_digits precede all non_zero_digits.
  - type: conservation
    description: The count of each specific digit (0-9) is the same in the input_sequence and the output_sequence.
