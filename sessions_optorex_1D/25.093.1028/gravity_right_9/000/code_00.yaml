Task: Reorder sequence elements based on value (zero vs. non-zero)

Input:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string
      - content: space-separated single-digit integers (0-9)
      - elements: contains a mix of zeros and non-zero digits

Output:
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: string
      - content: space-separated single-digit integers (0-9)
      - length: identical to input_sequence length
      - composition: contains the same multiset of digits as input_sequence

Transformation:
  - action: partition
    description: Separate the elements of the input_sequence into two groups.
    operands:
      - input_sequence
    based_on: element value (is zero or is non-zero)
    outputs:
      - group_zeros: a sequence containing all '0's from the input.
      - group_non_zeros: a sequence containing all non-zero digits from the input, preserving their original relative order.
  - action: concatenate
    description: Combine the two groups to form the output sequence.
    operands:
      - group_zeros
      - group_non_zeros
    order: group_zeros first, followed by group_non_zeros.
    output: ordered_sequence
  - action: format
    description: Convert the ordered sequence of integers back into a space-separated string.
    operands:
      - ordered_sequence
    output: output_sequence (final string format)

Relationships:
  - The output_sequence is a permutation of the input_sequence.
  - All zeros from the input_sequence precede all non-zeros in the output_sequence.
  - The relative order of non-zero elements is maintained from input_sequence to output_sequence.
