Task: Reorder a sequence of numbers by moving zeros to the front.

Input:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: Sequence of integers (represented as a 1D NumPy array in the target function).
      - content: Contains single-digit integers (0-9).
      - elements: A mix of zero and non-zero digits.

Output:
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: Sequence of integers (represented as a 1D NumPy array in the target function).
      - length: Identical to input_sequence length.
      - composition: Contains the exact same multiset of digits as input_sequence.
      - order: All zero elements appear before all non-zero elements.

Transformation:
  - action: Partition
    description: Divide the input sequence into two sub-sequences based on element value.
    operands:
      - input_sequence
    criteria:
      - value == 0 (for zero sub-sequence)
      - value != 0 (for non-zero sub-sequence)
    preservation: The relative order of elements within the non-zero sub-sequence must be the same as their relative order in the original input_sequence.
    outputs:
      - zero_subsequence: Contains all '0's from the input.
      - non_zero_subsequence: Contains all non-zero digits from the input, in their original relative order.
  - action: Concatenate
    description: Combine the two sub-sequences to form the output sequence.
    operands:
      - zero_subsequence
      - non_zero_subsequence
    order: zero_subsequence first, followed by non_zero_subsequence.
    output: output_sequence

Relationships:
  - output_sequence is a permutation of input_sequence.
  - The count of each distinct digit is preserved between input and output.
  - The relative order of non-zero digits is preserved between input and output.

Execution_Note:
  - The provided execution results show the transformation failing (output equals input). This contradicts the transformation clearly demonstrated by the input/output examples themselves. The issue likely lies in the code execution environment or integration, not the transformation logic derived from the examples.
