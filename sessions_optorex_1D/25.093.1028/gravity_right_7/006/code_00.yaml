Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: single digits (0-9)
  representation: list or array of integers (derived from space-separated string)
  properties:
    - contains zero and non-zero digits
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: single digits (0-9)
  representation: list or array of integers (to be formatted as space-separated string)
  properties:
    - same length as input
    - same count of zeros as input
    - same count of non-zeros as input
    - contains the same non-zero digits as input, in the same relative order
Relationship:
  - Output is a reordering (permutation) of the Input sequence.
Transformation:
  action: Partition and Concatenate
  rule:
    - Partition the input sequence into two sub-sequences based on element value.
    - First sub-sequence: contains all elements equal to 0.
    - Second sub-sequence: contains all elements not equal to 0, maintaining their original relative order.
    - Concatenate the first sub-sequence (zeros) followed by the second sub-sequence (non-zeros) to produce the output sequence.
