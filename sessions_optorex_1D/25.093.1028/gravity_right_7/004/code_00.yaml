Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: single digits (0-9)
  representation: space-separated string (likely converted to list or NumPy array in execution)
  length: consistent (12 in examples)
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: single digits (0-9)
  representation: space-separated string
  length: same as input length
Properties:
  - digits:
      value: Can be zero (0) or non-zero (1-9)
Relationship:
  - Output is a reordering of the Input sequence.
  - The count of zero digits remains the same.
  - The count of non-zero digits remains the same.
  - The relative order of non-zero digits is preserved.
Transformation:
  action: Partitioning and Concatenation
  rule:
    - Iterate through each element of the input sequence individually.
    - Separate the elements into two groups: one containing all the zero (0) elements and another containing all the non-zero elements.
    - Maintain the original relative order of elements within the non-zero group.
    - Construct the output sequence by concatenating the group of zero elements followed by the group of non-zero elements.
Implementation_Note:
  - The previous execution failed due to attempting boolean evaluation on a multi-element array. The implementation must ensure element-wise comparison (e.g., comparing each digit individually in the loop).
