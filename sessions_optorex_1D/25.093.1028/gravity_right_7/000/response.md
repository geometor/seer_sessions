**Perception of Elements:**

The input and output are both sequences of single-digit numbers, presented as space-separated strings. The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence in all examples. The core operation appears to be a rearrangement of the elements within the sequence based on their value (zero or non-zero). The relative order of the non-zero elements is preserved, as is the count of zero elements.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: sequence
  elements: single digits (0-9)
  representation: space-separated string
Output:
  type: sequence
  elements: single digits (0-9)
  representation: space-separated string
  length: same as input length
Properties:
  - digits:
      value: Can be zero (0) or non-zero (1-9)
Relationship:
  - Output is a reordering of the Input sequence.
Transformation:
  action: Partitioning and Concatenation
  rule:
    - Identify all zero digits in the input sequence.
    - Identify all non-zero digits in the input sequence, preserving their original relative order.
    - Construct the output sequence by concatenating all identified zero digits followed by all identified non-zero digits.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
2.  Create two empty lists: one for zero digits (`zeros_list`) and one for non-zero digits (`non_zeros_list`).
3.  Iterate through the input sequence, digit by digit.
4.  For each digit:
    *   If the digit is 0, append it to the `zeros_list`.
    *   If the digit is not 0, append it to the `non_zeros_list`.
5.  Concatenate the `zeros_list` and the `non_zeros_list` to form the final output sequence.
6.  Format the output sequence as a space-separated string of digits.
