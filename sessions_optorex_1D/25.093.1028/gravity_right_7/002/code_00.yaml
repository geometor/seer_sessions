Input:
  type: sequence # Likely a list or array based on execution errors
  elements: single digits (0-9)
Output:
  type: sequence # Corresponding list or array
  elements: single digits (0-9)
  length: same as input length
Properties:
  - digits:
      value: Can be zero (0) or non-zero (1-9)
Relationship:
  - Output is a reordering of the Input sequence.
  - The count of zero elements in the output matches the count in the input.
  - The count of non-zero elements in the output matches the count in the input.
  - The relative order of non-zero elements is preserved from input to output.
Transformation:
  action: Partitioning and Concatenation
  rule:
    - Identify all zero digits in the input sequence.
    - Identify all non-zero digits in the input sequence, preserving their original relative order.
    - Construct the output sequence by concatenating all identified zero digits followed by all identified non-zero digits.
