task_description: "Rearrange digits in a space-separated string, moving all '0' digits to the beginning while preserving the relative order of the non-zero digits."
input_format:
  type: string
  description: "A single string containing space-separated single digits (0-9)."
  delimiter: " "
  element_type: character (digit)
  constraints:
    - All elements are single digits.
    - Length appears fixed at 12 digits in examples, but the logic should generalize.
output_format:
  type: string
  description: "A single string containing space-separated single digits, rearranged according to the rule."
  delimiter: " "
  element_type: character (digit)
  constraints:
    - Contains the same digits as the input.
    - Same length as the input.
transformation:
  action: partition and rearrange
  elements: individual digits (represented as strings)
  steps:
    - description: "Split the input string into a list of digit strings using the space delimiter."
      input: input string
      output: list of digit strings
    - description: "Partition the list into two separate lists: one for '0' digits and one for non-'0' digits, maintaining the original relative order within the non-'0' list."
      input: list of digit strings
      output: two lists (zeros, non-zeros)
    - description: "Concatenate the list of '0' digits followed by the list of non-'0' digits."
      input: two lists (zeros, non-zeros)
      output: combined list of digit strings in the target order
    - description: "Join the elements of the combined list back into a single string, separated by spaces."
      input: combined list of digit strings
      output: output string
examples_summary:
  count: 7
  consistency: "All examples adhere strictly to the transformation rule."
error_analysis:
  previous_code_error: "The NumPy-based implementation failed likely due to incorrect assumptions about input type/structure during execution or improper handling of the NumPy array within the function logic, leading to boolean ambiguity errors."
  recommended_approach: "Use standard string and list manipulation (split, list comprehensions or loops for partitioning, join)."
