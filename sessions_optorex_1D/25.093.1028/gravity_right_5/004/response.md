## General Assessment and Strategy

The core task involves rearranging a sequence of digits presented as a space-separated string. The rule is to move all '0' digits to the beginning of the sequence while preserving the relative order of the non-zero digits.

The initial analysis and the first Python code implementation (using string splitting and list manipulation) correctly captured this logic. The subsequent attempt using NumPy resulted in errors ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") across all examples. This strongly suggests an incompatibility between the NumPy code's assumptions about its input (`input_array`) and how the test environment provided the data, or an error in how the NumPy array was processed within the function (e.g., iterating incorrectly or using the whole array in a boolean check).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Validate Core Logic:** Confirm the rearrangement rule (zeros first, preserve non-zero order) holds for all examples by analyzing the input/output pairs.
2.  **Revert to String/List Processing:** Base the refined understanding and documentation on the initial, conceptually sound string/list processing approach, as it directly matches the input format and avoids the observed NumPy errors.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to clearly describe the process using string manipulation (split, filter/partition, join).

## Metrics and Analysis

Based on the provided examples:

*   **Consistency:** All 7 training examples consistently follow the same transformation rule.
*   **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are strings containing 12 space-separated digits.
*   **Element Preservation:** All digits present in the input are also present in the output. The number of '0's and the specific non-zero digits remain the same.
*   **Order Preservation (Non-Zeros):** The relative order of the non-zero digits is maintained from input to output.
*   **Order Change (Zeros):** All '0' digits are moved to the beginning of the sequence.

Let's verify the counts and non-zero sequences for a couple more examples:

*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `6 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 2 7 0` (Zeros: 7, Non-Zeros: `6 8 6 2 7`)
    *   Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 8 6 2 7` (Zeros: 7, Non-Zeros: `6 8 6 2 7`) -> Matches logic.
*   **train_7:**
    *   Input: `9 2 5 0 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 0` (Zeros: 7, Non-Zeros: `9 2 5 6 8`)
    *   Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2 5 6 8` (Zeros: 7, Non-Zeros: `9 2 5 6 8`) -> Matches logic.

The analysis confirms the initial understanding of the transformation rule is correct. The execution errors stemmed from the specific NumPy implementation attempt, not the logic itself.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a single string containing space-separated digits.
2.  Split the input string by spaces to create a list of individual digit strings.
3.  Initialize two empty lists: `zeros` and `non_zeros`.
4.  Iterate through the list of digit strings created in step 2:
    *   If the current digit string is equal to '0', append it to the `zeros` list.
    *   Otherwise (if it's a non-zero digit string), append it to the `non_zeros` list.
5.  Create the final ordered list by concatenating the `zeros` list followed by the `non_zeros` list.
6.  Join the elements of this final ordered list together using a single space as the separator.
7.  Return the resulting string.
