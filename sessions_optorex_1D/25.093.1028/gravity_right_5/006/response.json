            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code assumed the input would be a space-separated string. However, the error messages (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) clearly indicate that the `transform` function is being called with a NumPy array as input, not a string. The core logic of partitioning the elements based on whether they are zero or non-zero and preserving the relative order of non-zero elements seems correct based on the initial examples, but the implementation needs to be adapted to handle NumPy array input. The strategy is to modify the code to iterate through the elements of the input NumPy array directly, perform the partitioning, and then format the resulting list of numbers into the required space-separated string output.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   **Input Type:** Consistently `numpy.ndarray` across all examples based on the error messages.\n    *   **Output Type:** Expected output is consistently a space-separated `string`.\n    *   **Element Type (Input):** Assumed to be integers within the NumPy array (specifically single digits 0-9 based on original examples). The comparison `element == 0` will work correctly for integers.\n    *   **Transformation Rule:** Partitioning based on zero/non-zero values and maintaining the relative order of non-zeros appears consistent across the provided input/output pairs. Zeros are moved to the beginning.\n    *   **Error Consistency:** The same `AttributeError` occurs for all examples, confirming the input type mismatch is the sole issue identified so far.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
