Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of space-separated integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is consistent across examples (12 elements) and matches the length of the corresponding output sequence.
*   **Element Values:** The elements are single digits (0-9).
*   **Key Observation:** The non-zero numbers present in the input sequence are also present in the output sequence, and their relative order is preserved. The zero elements ('0') appear to be treated differently.
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve rearranging the elements. Specifically, all non-zero elements are shifted towards the right end of the sequence, maintaining their original relative order, while all zero elements are shifted to the left end.

**YAML Fact Document:**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - elements: integers between 0 and 9
  - object: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - elements: integers between 0 and 9
actions:
  - action: partition
    target: input_sequence
    based_on: element value (zero vs. non-zero)
    result: two sub-sequences (zeros, non-zeros)
  - action: concatenate
    source_1: sub-sequence of zeros
    source_2: sub-sequence of non-zeros (preserving relative order)
    result: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: preservation
    between: non-zero elements in input_sequence and non-zero elements in output_sequence
    property: relative order
  - type: equality
    property: count
    between: zeros in input_sequence and zeros in output_sequence
  - type: equality
    property: count
    between: non-zeros in input_sequence and non-zeros in output_sequence
  - type: equality
    property: length
    between: input_sequence and output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of integers.
2.  Create a new list containing only the non-zero elements from the input sequence, maintaining their original relative order.
3.  Count the number of zero elements present in the input sequence.
4.  Construct the output sequence by first creating a list containing the counted number of zero elements.
5.  Append the list of non-zero elements (created in step 2) to the end of the list of zeros (created in step 4).
6.  Return the resulting combined sequence.
