The zero elements ('0') appear to be treated differently.\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation seems to involve rearranging the elements. Specifically, all non-zero elements are shifted towards the right end of the sequence, maintaining their original relative order, while all zero elements are shifted to the left end.\n\n**YAML Fact Document:**\n\n"
