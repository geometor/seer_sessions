"""
Takes a sequence of integers (likely a list or NumPy array).
Separates the zero elements from the non-zero elements.
Constructs a new sequence where all the zero elements from the input are placed at the beginning,
followed by all the non-zero elements from the input, maintaining their original relative order.
Returns the resulting sequence in the same format as the input (assumed to be NumPy array based on errors).
