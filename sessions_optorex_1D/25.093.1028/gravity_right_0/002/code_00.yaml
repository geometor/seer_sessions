task_elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    type: sequence of integers # Adjusted from string based on error
    properties:
      - length: fixed (12 in examples)
      - elements: integers between 0 and 9
      - source_format: Likely list or numpy.ndarray
  - object: output_sequence
    type: sequence of integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence
      - elements: integers between 0 and 9
      - target_format: Matches input sequence type
actions:
  - action: partition
    target: input_sequence
    based_on: element value (zero vs. non-zero)
    result: two sub-sequences (zeros, non-zeros)
  - action: concatenate
    source_1: sub-sequence of zeros
    source_2: sub-sequence of non-zeros (preserving relative order)
    result: output_sequence
relationships:
  - type: preservation
    between: non-zero elements in input_sequence and non-zero elements in output_sequence
    property: relative order
  - type: equality
    property: count
    between: zeros in input_sequence and zeros in output_sequence
  - type: equality
    property: count
    between: non-zeros in input_sequence and non-zeros in output_sequence
  - type: equality
    property: length
    between: input_sequence and output_sequence
