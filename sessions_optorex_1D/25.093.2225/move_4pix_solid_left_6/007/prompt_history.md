*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are strings representing sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence is a transformation of the input where the non-zero block appears shifted.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant (12 digits in all examples).
    *   The non-zero block is shifted exactly 4 positions to the left.
    *   Positions outside the shifted non-zero block in the output are filled with zeros.

*   **YAML Facts:**

        description: The non-zero block is moved 4 positions earlier in the sequence.
        post_action: Fill remaining positions with the background digit '0'.
    relationship:
      - The output sequence is generated by finding the non-zero block in the input sequence, shifting it 4 positions to the left, and filling all other positions with '0'.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. Determine its value, starting position (index), and length.
    2.  Calculate the new starting position for this block by subtracting 4 from its original starting position.
    3.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with zeros.
    4.  Place the identified non-zero block (using its value and length) into the new sequence starting at the calculated new position.

## General Assessment

The provided code execution results indicate a complete failure of the `transform` function. In every example (training and testing), the function produced an output sequence consisting entirely of zeros, regardless of the input. This suggests a fundamental issue in either identifying the non-zero block or placing it into the output array.

The original Python code included a helper function `_find_non_zero_block` designed to work with a Python list and a main `transform` function designed to work with a NumPy array. The mismatch likely lies in how the NumPy array (`input_grid`) is processed before being passed to `_find_non_zero_block` or how the results are placed back into the NumPy `output_grid`.

Specifically, the code assumes `input_grid` is a 1D array. However, based on standard practices in similar tasks, the input is likely a 2D NumPy array (even if it only has one row). The code used `n = input_grid.shape[0]` (number of rows) instead of `input_grid.shape[1]` (number of columns) for the sequence length and attempted to convert the entire 2D array `input_grid.tolist()` which results in a list of lists (e.g., `[[0, 0, ...]]`) rather than a flat list of integers `[0, 0, ...]`. The `_find_non_zero_block` function expects a flat list and would fail to find the block in a list of lists. Furthermore, assignment into the `output_grid` used a single index `output_grid[target_idx] = value`, which is incorrect for a 2D array; it should be `output_grid[row_index, target_idx] = value`.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the input `input_grid` is a 2D NumPy array with one row (shape `(1, N)`).
2.  **Correct `transform` function:**
    *   Modify the code to extract the first (and only) row from the `input_grid` for processing.
    *   Use the correct dimension (`input_grid.shape[1]`) for the sequence length `n`.
    *   Pass the extracted 1D list to `_find_non_zero_block`.
    *   When placing the block into the `output_grid`, use 2D indexing (e.g., `output_grid[0, target_idx] = value`).
3.  **Verify Logic:** Re-verify that the core logic (find block, calculate new start index by subtracting 4, place block) aligns with all examples.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's analyze the block properties for each example.

The metrics confirm that for every example, the non-zero block in the output starts exactly 4 positions to the left of the block in the input. The value and length of the block remain unchanged. The assumption of a left shift by 4 is correct and consistent across all examples. The failure lies purely in the previous code's implementation, likely due to incorrect handling of the assumed 2D NumPy array input.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D grid (specifically 1 row, N columns) representing a sequence of integers.
    properties:
      rows: 1
      columns: Variable (12 in the examples provided)
      elements: Single digits (0-9)
      background_digit: 0
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of identical non-zero digits within the input grid's single row.
    properties:
      value: The non-zero digit comprising the block (e.g., 7, 3, 9).
      start_column: The 0-based column index where the block begins in the input grid.
      length: The number of digits (columns) the block occupies.
      row_index: 0 (since the grid has only one row)
  - type: background
    description: The digit '0' which fills the grid space around the non-zero block.
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift_left
  object: non-zero block
  parameter:
    amount: 4 columns
  result:
    description: The non-zero block is moved 4 columns to the left within the grid's row.
    post_action: Create a new grid of the same dimensions, initialized with the background digit '0'. Place the shifted block into this new grid at its calculated position.
relationship:
  - The output grid is generated by identifying the non-zero block in the input grid's row, calculating its new starting column by subtracting 4 from the original starting column, and placing this block into a new zero-filled grid of identical dimensions at the new position.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions (rows and columns) remain the same.
  - The value and length of the non-zero block remain the same.
  - The background digit remains '0'.
  - There is only one non-zero block per input grid.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a 2D grid (assumed to have 1 row and N columns).
2.  Create a new output grid of the same dimensions as the input grid, filled entirely with the background digit '0'.
3.  Examine the first (and only) row of the input grid.
4.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within this row. Determine its value, its starting column index, and its length (number of columns it occupies).
5.  Calculate the target starting column index for this block in the output grid by subtracting 4 from its original starting column index in the input grid.
6.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1`:
    a.  Calculate the target column index: `target_col = target_starting_column_index + i`.
    b.  If `target_col` is a valid column index within the grid dimensions (i.e., `0 <= target_col < N`), place the block's `value` into the output grid at `[row_index = 0, column_index = target_col]`.
7.  Return the generated output grid.
