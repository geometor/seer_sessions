task_elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D grid (specifically 1 row, N columns) representing a sequence of integers.
    properties:
      rows: 1
      columns: Variable (12 in the examples provided)
      elements: Single digits (0-9)
      background_digit: 0
  - type: object
    description: A contiguous horizontal block of identical non-zero digits within the input grid's single row.
    properties:
      value: The non-zero digit comprising the block (e.g., 7, 3, 9).
      start_column: The 0-based column index where the block begins in the input grid.
      length: The number of digits (columns) the block occupies.
      row_index: 0 (since the grid has only one row)
  - type: background
    description: The digit '0' which fills the grid space around the non-zero block.
transformation:
  action: horizontal_shift_left
  object: non-zero block
  parameter:
    amount: 4 columns
  result:
    description: The non-zero block is moved 4 columns to the left within the grid's row.
    post_action: Create a new grid of the same dimensions, initialized with the background digit '0'. Place the shifted block into this new grid at its calculated position.
relationship:
  - The output grid is generated by identifying the non-zero block in the input grid's row, calculating its new starting column by subtracting 4 from the original starting column, and placing this block into a new zero-filled grid of identical dimensions at the new position.
invariants:
  - Grid dimensions (rows and columns) remain the same.
  - The value and length of the non-zero block remain the same.
  - The background digit remains '0'.
  - There is only one non-zero block per input grid.
