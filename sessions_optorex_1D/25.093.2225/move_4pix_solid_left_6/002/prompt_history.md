*   **Perception of the elements:**
    *   The input and output are strings representing sequences of single digits separated by spaces.
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence is a transformation of the input where the non-zero block appears shifted.
    *   The length of the sequence remains constant (12 digits in all examples).
    *   The non-zero block is shifted exactly 4 positions to the left.
    *   Positions outside the shifted non-zero block in the output are filled with zeros.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - type: sequence
        description: A sequence of digits represented as a space-separated string.
        properties:
          length: 12 (constant across examples)
          elements: Single digits (0-9)
      - type: object
        description: A contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence.
        properties:
          value: The non-zero digit (e.g., 7, 3, 9, 8, 6, 4)
          start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input.
          length: The number of digits in the block.
      - type: background
        description: The digit '0' which fills the space around the non-zero block.
    transformation:
      action: shift_left
      object: non-zero block
      parameter:
        amount: 4 positions
      result:
        description: The non-zero block is moved 4 positions earlier in the sequence.
        post_action: Fill remaining positions with the background digit '0'.
    relationship:
      - The output sequence is generated by finding the non-zero block in the input sequence, shifting it 4 positions to the left, and filling all other positions with '0'.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence. Determine its value, starting position (index), and length.
    2.  Calculate the new starting position for this block by subtracting 4 from its original starting position.
    3.  Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initially filled entirely with zeros.
    4.  Place the identified non-zero block (using its value and length) into the new sequence starting at the calculated new position.
    5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
