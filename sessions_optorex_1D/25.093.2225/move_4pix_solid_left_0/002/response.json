            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous code failed on all examples with a `ValueError` related to ambiguous truth values of arrays. This strongly indicates that the input data, assumed to be a simple list, is actually being passed as a NumPy array (likely 2D, e.g., shape 1xN). Comparisons like `array != scalar` produce boolean arrays, which cannot be directly used in standard `if` conditions.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the code to expect a 2D NumPy array as input.\n2.  **Extract Sequence:** Identify and extract the relevant 1D sequence from the input grid (in this case, it appears to be the first row).\n3.  **Apply Core Logic:** Use the existing logic (find the contiguous non-zero block and its properties) on the extracted 1D sequence.\n4.  **Calculate New Position:** Compute the new starting position by subtracting a fixed shift amount (4) from the original starting index.\n5.  **Reconstruct Output:** Create a new 1D sequence of the same length, place the shifted block, fill the rest with zeros, and format it as a 2D NumPy array matching the input structure (1xN).\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nThe following `tool_code` block simulates the processing for `train_1` based on the revised strategy, confirming the input structure assumption and the calculation logic.\n\n"
