Within each input sequence, there are two distinct types of objects:\n1.  **Background:** Represented by the integer `0`.\n2.  **Foreground Object:** A contiguous block (run) of identical non-zero integers (e.g., `6 6 6`, `1 1 1 1`, `3 3 3`).\n\nThe transformation acts upon the entire sequence but specifically targets the foreground object. The output sequence retains the background and the foreground object, but the position of the foreground object changes relative to the background.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
