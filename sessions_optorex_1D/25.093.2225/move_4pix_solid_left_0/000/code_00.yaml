task_type: sequence_transformation
input_description: A list of 12 integers.
output_description: A list of 12 integers.
elements:
  - name: background_value
    value: 0
    role: fills the sequence outside the foreground object
  - name: foreground_object
    properties:
      - type: contiguous block of identical non-zero integers
      - value: the specific non-zero integer (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 6, 9)
      - length: number of elements in the block
      - start_index: position of the first element of the block in the input sequence
    role: the primary element being manipulated
relationships:
  - type: spatial
    description: The foreground_object is embedded within a sequence filled primarily with the background_value.
actions:
  - name: identify_foreground_object
    description: Locate the contiguous block of non-zero identical integers within the input sequence. Determine its value, start index, and length.
  - name: shift_object
    description: Move the identified foreground_object 4 positions to the left (decrease its start index by 4).
  - name: reconstruct_sequence
    description: Create the output sequence by placing the shifted foreground_object at its new position and filling all other positions with the background_value (0).
constants:
  - name: sequence_length
    value: 12
  - name: shift_amount
    value: -4 # (Shift left by 4 positions)
