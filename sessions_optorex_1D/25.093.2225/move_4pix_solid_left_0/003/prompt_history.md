**Perception of Elements:**

The core elements are sequences of integers. Each sequence represents a one-dimensional array or list of fixed length (12 in these examples). Within each input sequence, there are two distinct types of objects:
1.  **Background:** Represented by the integer `0`.
2.  **Foreground Object:** A contiguous block (run) of identical non-zero integers (e.g., `6 6 6`, `1 1 1 1`, `3 3 3`).

The transformation acts upon the entire sequence but specifically targets the foreground object. The output sequence retains the background and the foreground object, but the position of the foreground object changes relative to the background.

**Facts:**

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled with zeros.
2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the beginning of the foreground object.
3.  Identify the value and the full extent (start index and length) of this contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
4.  Calculate the new start index for the foreground object in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from its start index in the input sequence.
5.  Place the identified foreground object (with its original value and length) into the output sequence starting at the calculated new start index.
6.  Return the modified output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous code failed on all examples with a `ValueError` related to ambiguous truth values of arrays. This strongly indicates that the input data, assumed to be a simple list, is actually being passed as a NumPy array (likely 2D, e.g., shape 1xN). Comparisons like `array != scalar` produce boolean arrays, which cannot be directly used in standard `if` conditions.

The strategy is to:
1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the code to expect a 2D NumPy array as input.
2.  **Extract Sequence:** Identify and extract the relevant 1D sequence from the input grid (in this case, it appears to be the first row).
3.  **Apply Core Logic:** Use the existing logic (find the contiguous non-zero block and its properties) on the extracted 1D sequence.
4.  **Calculate New Position:** Compute the new starting position by subtracting a fixed shift amount (4) from the original starting index.
5.  **Reconstruct Output:** Create a new 1D sequence of the same length, place the shifted block, fill the rest with zeros, and format it as a 2D NumPy array matching the input structure (1xN).

**Metrics Gathering**

The following `tool_code` block simulates the processing for `train_1` based on the revised strategy, confirming the input structure assumption and the calculation logic.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid (specifically, a 1xN NumPy array).
2.  Extract the 1D sequence of numbers from the first row of the input grid. Let the length of this sequence be L.
3.  Initialize a new 1D sequence (output sequence) of length L, filled entirely with zeros.
4.  Scan the extracted 1D input sequence to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (the foreground object). Record its integer value, its starting index (column position in the original grid), and its length (number of cells).
5.  If no foreground object is found, proceed to step 8.
6.  Calculate the target starting index for the object in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from its starting index found in step 4.
7.  Copy the foreground object (using its recorded value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index. Handle boundary conditions: only place parts of the object that fall within the valid indices (0 to L-1) of the output sequence.
8.  Convert the generated 1D output sequence into a 2D grid format (1 row, L columns).
9.  Return the resulting 2D grid.
