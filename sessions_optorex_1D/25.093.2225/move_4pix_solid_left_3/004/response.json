            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe execution results indicate a consistent error across all examples: `all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1 dimension(s)`. This error occurs during the `np.concatenate` step. It reveals that the input (`input_grid`) is being passed as a 2-dimensional NumPy array (likely shape (1, 12) based on the original string representation), while the code attempted to concatenate it with a 1-dimensional padding array (`padding_part`).\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the exact shape of the input `input_grid` using `tool_code`.\n2.  Adjust the slicing and concatenation logic to work correctly with 2D arrays. Specifically, slicing should target the elements *within the row*, and the concatenation should produce a result that is reshaped back into the original 2D format (e.g., (1, 12)).\n3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this 2D structure and the adjusted operations.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nLet's examine the shape and dimensions of the input as processed by the execution environment. We'll use the first training example.\n"
