**Assessment:**

The execution results show a consistent error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding in the initial analysis about the input data type. The `transform` function was designed to process a string (`input_str`) based on the visual representation in the problem description. However, the testing environment actually provides the input as a NumPy array.

The core transformation logic identified (a left shift by 4 positions with zero-padding on the right) appears consistent across all examples, but the implementation failed because it attempted string operations on an array object.

**Strategy:**

The strategy is to modify the approach to directly handle the input as a NumPy array (or easily convertible list of integers). The `parse_input` and `format_output` functions, designed for string manipulation, are unnecessary and incorrect in this context. The core `shift_left` logic needs to be adapted or reimplemented to work directly with array/list structures.

**Metrics:**

The transformation rule observed in the initial analysis holds true for all provided training examples:

| Example | Input Sequence                       | Output Sequence                      | Shift Amount | Pad Value |
| :------ | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------- | :-------- |
| train_1 | `[0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0]`        | `[2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0]`        | 4            | 0         |
| train_2 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0]`        | `[0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]`        | 4            | 0         |
| train_3 | `[0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]`        | `[1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        | 4            | 0         |
| train_4 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3]`        | `[0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0]`        | 4            | 0         |
| train_5 | `[0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        | `[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        | 4            | 0         |
| train_6 | `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0]`        | `[0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        | 4            | 0         |
| train_7 | `[0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0]`        | `[0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`        | 4            | 0         |

The length of the sequence is consistently 12 in both input and output. The transformation is a fixed leftward circular shift (or rather, a slice and pad operation) by 4 positions.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence (which is a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Take a slice of the input sequence starting from the 5th element (index 4) through the end.
3.  Create a new sequence containing 4 elements, each with the value 0.
4.  Concatenate the slice from step 2 and the new sequence from step 3 to form the output sequence.
5.  Return the output sequence.
