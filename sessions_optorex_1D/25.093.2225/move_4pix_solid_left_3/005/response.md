Receive the input as a 2D NumPy array, specifically structured as a single row with 12 columns (shape (1, 12)).
Define a shift amount of 4 positions and a padding value of 0.
Extract the sequence of elements from the first (and only) row of the input array.
Create a new sequence by taking a slice of the extracted sequence, starting from the fifth element (index 4) and including all subsequent elements.
Create a padding sequence consisting of 4 elements, each with the value 0.
Concatenate the sliced sequence followed by the padding sequence to form a new 1D sequence of 12 elements.
Reshape this resulting 1D sequence into a 2D NumPy array with 1 row and 12 columns (shape (1, 12)).

    # --- Transformation Steps ---

    # 1. Extract the single row from the input_grid (as a 1D array).
    #    Example: if input_grid is [[0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]],
    #    input_row will be [0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]
    input_row = input_grid[0]

    # 2. Slice the row starting from index 'shift_amount' to the end.
    #    This effectively removes the first 'shift_amount' elements.
    #    Example: shifted_part will be [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0]
    shifted_part = input_row[shift_amount:]

    # 3. Create a 1D padding array of 'pad_value' with length 'shift_amount'.
    #    Example: padding_part will be [0,0,0,0]
    #    Using the same dtype as the input row prevents potential type issues.
    padding_part = np.full(shift_amount, pad_value, dtype=input_row.dtype)

    # 4. Concatenate the sliced row and the padding array.
    #    Example: concatenated_row will be [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]
    concatenated_row = np.concatenate((shifted_part, padding_part))

    # 5. Reshape the concatenated 1D array back into a 2D array with shape (1, 12).
    #    The '-1' in reshape infers the second dimension length (which will be 12).
    output_grid = concatenated_row.reshape(1, -1) # or np.array([concatenated_row])

    # 6. Return the final 2D array.
    return output_grid
