Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of digits, separated by spaces. When treated as lists or arrays, they consist of integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains constant across input and output (12 digits in all examples).
*   **Digit '0':** The digit '0' appears frequently and seems to act as a background or padding element.
*   **Non-Zero Digits:** Each input contains a contiguous block (or a single instance) of a non-zero digit (e.g., '2', '8', '1', '3', '6', '7'). This block is preserved in the output, maintaining its length and the specific non-zero digit.
*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation is a positional shift of the non-zero block within the sequence. Comparing the start index of the non-zero block in the input and output reveals a consistent leftward shift.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The execution results indicate a consistent error across all examples: `all the input arrays must have same number of dimensions, but the array at index 0 has 2 dimension(s) and the array at index 1 has 1 dimension(s)`. This error occurs during the `np.concatenate` step. It reveals that the input (`input_grid`) is being passed as a 2-dimensional NumPy array (likely shape (1, 12) based on the original string representation), while the code attempted to concatenate it with a 1-dimensional padding array (`padding_part`).

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the exact shape of the input `input_grid` using `tool_code`.
2.  Adjust the slicing and concatenation logic to work correctly with 2D arrays. Specifically, slicing should target the elements *within the row*, and the concatenation should produce a result that is reshaped back into the original 2D format (e.g., (1, 12)).
3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect this 2D structure and the adjusted operations.

**Metrics Gathering**

Let's examine the shape and dimensions of the input as processed by the execution environment. We'll use the first training example.


*code_execution:*
```python
import numpy as np

# Simulate the input structure based on the original string and error message
input_str_1 = "0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0"
input_list_1 = [int(x) for x in input_str_1.split()]
# Assume the environment wraps it in a 2D array (1 row, N columns)
input_grid_1 = np.array([input_list_1])

print(f"Example 1 Input Shape: {input_grid_1.shape}")
print(f"Example 1 Input Dimensions: {input_grid_1.ndim}")

# Let's re-simulate the slice and padding from the failed code
shift_amount = 4
pad_value = 0

# Original code slice (likely incorrect for 2D): shifted_part = input_grid_1[shift_amount:]
# Corrected slice for the first row:
shifted_part_corrected = input_grid_1[0, shift_amount:]
# Original padding:
padding_part = np.full(shift_amount, pad_value, dtype=input_grid_1.dtype)

print(f"Corrected Shifted Part (1D slice): {shifted_part_corrected}")
print(f"Corrected Shifted Part Shape: {shifted_part_corrected.shape}")
print(f"Corrected Shifted Part Dimensions: {shifted_part_corrected.ndim}")

print(f"Padding Part: {padding_part}")
print(f"Padding Part Shape: {padding_part.shape}")
print(f"Padding Part Dimensions: {padding_part.ndim}")

# Concatenation (now both are 1D)
concatenated_1d = np.concatenate((shifted_part_corrected, padding_part))
print(f"Concatenated (1D): {concatenated_1d}")
print(f"Concatenated Shape (1D): {concatenated_1d.shape}")

# Reshape back to 2D for output
output_grid_simulated = np.array([concatenated_1d])
print(f"Final Output Shape (Simulated): {output_grid_simulated.shape}")
```

*code_execution_result:*
outcome: OUTCOME_OK
```
Example 1 Input Shape: (1, 12)
Example 1 Input Dimensions: 2
Corrected Shifted Part (1D slice): [2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0]
Corrected Shifted Part Shape: (8,)
Corrected Shifted Part Dimensions: 1
Padding Part: [0 0 0 0]
Padding Part Shape: (4,)
Padding Part Dimensions: 1
Concatenated (1D): [2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0]
Concatenated Shape (1D): (12,)
Final Output Shape (Simulated): (1, 12)

```
**Findings:**

*   The input `input_grid` is indeed a 2D array with shape (1, 12).
*   The previous code likely failed because slicing `input_grid[shift_amount:]` on a (1, 12) array doesn't produce the intended row slice.
*   The correct approach is to slice the specific row (`input_grid[0, shift_amount:]`), which yields a 1D array.
*   The padding array (`padding_part`) is already 1D.
*   Concatenating these two 1D arrays works correctly.
*   The final result must be reshaped into a 2D array of shape (1, 12) to match the expected output format.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a 2D NumPy array, specifically structured as a single row with 12 columns (shape (1, 12)).
2.  Define a shift amount of 4 positions and a padding value of 0.
3.  Extract the sequence of elements from the first (and only) row of the input array.
4.  Create a new sequence by taking a slice of the extracted sequence, starting from the fifth element (index 4) and including all subsequent elements.
5.  Create a padding sequence consisting of 4 elements, each with the value 0.
6.  Concatenate the sliced sequence from step 4 followed by the padding sequence from step 5 to form a new 1D sequence of 12 elements.
7.  Reshape this resulting 1D sequence into a 2D NumPy array with 1 row and 12 columns (shape (1, 12)).
8.  Return this final 2D array as the output.
