Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of digits, separated by spaces. When treated as lists or arrays, they consist of integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** The length of the sequence remains constant across input and output (12 digits in all examples).
*   **Digit '0':** The digit '0' appears frequently and seems to act as a background or padding element.
*   **Non-Zero Digits:** Each input contains a contiguous block (or a single instance) of a non-zero digit (e.g., '2', '8', '1', '3', '6', '7'). This block is preserved in the output, maintaining its length and the specific non-zero digit.
*   **Transformation:** The primary transformation is a positional shift of the non-zero block within the sequence. Comparing the start index of the non-zero block in the input and output reveals a consistent leftward shift.

**YAML Facts:**

    parameters:
      - sequence: input_sequence
      - shift_amount: 4
      - fill_value: 0
    effects:
      - removes first 4 elements
      - appends 4 instances of fill_value to the end
      - produces output_sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Treat the input sequence of digits as a list or array.
2.  Shift all elements of the sequence 4 positions to the left.
3.  Discard the first 4 elements that are shifted beyond the beginning of the sequence boundary.
4.  Fill the 4 empty positions created at the right end of the sequence with the digit 0.
5.  The resulting sequence is the output.
