            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code attempted to implement the core logic identified: find a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift it 4 positions to the left within a sequence of 12 integers. However, it failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.\n\nThis error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (like a simple `if array:` statement). This suggests that the testing environment is passing the input as a NumPy array, and some part of the code (likely within the `find_object` function or how its results are used) is causing this ambiguity, despite the attempt to convert the input to a Python list using `list(input_grid)`.\n\nThe manual analysis and the code execution performed to gather metrics confirm that the underlying transformation rule (find the block, calculate its properties, determine the new start position by subtracting 4) correctly maps inputs to outputs for all provided training examples.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to maintain the established transformation logic but refine the implementation in the coder phase to be fully robust to receiving NumPy arrays as input, ensuring all comparisons and conditional checks handle potential NumPy data types correctly, even after the explicit conversion to a list.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics were gathered by simulating the `find_object` function and the shift calculation on the training inputs:\n\n"
