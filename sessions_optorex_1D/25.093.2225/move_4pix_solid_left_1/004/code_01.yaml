    details: |
      Iterate from i = 0 to object_length - 1.
      Calculate target_index = new_start_index + i.
      If target_index is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (0 to 11),
      set output_sequence[target_index] = object_value.
      Otherwise, the part of the object falling outside the bounds is ignored.
