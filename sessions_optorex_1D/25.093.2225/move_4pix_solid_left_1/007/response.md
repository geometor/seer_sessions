"""
Identifies the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within an input sequence of 12 integers. Shifts this block 4 positions to the left, placing it into an output sequence of the same length (12) initialized with zeros. Positions outside the shifted block remain zero. Elements are only placed within the valid bounds (0-11) of the output sequence.
