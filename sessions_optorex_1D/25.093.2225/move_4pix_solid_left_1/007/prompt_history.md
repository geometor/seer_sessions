*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (or lists) of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence contains the same block of non-zero digits as the input, but its position within the sequence has changed. The remaining elements are zeros.

Error: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: find a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift it 4 positions to the left within a sequence of length 12, filling the remaining positions with zeros. All provided training examples consistently follow this rule.

The errors reported (`only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`) during testing strongly indicate a data type mismatch between what the Python code expects and what the testing environment provides. Specifically, the code seems to be attempting to convert an element (which might already be a number, possibly a NumPy integer type) into a standard Python integer using `int()`, or perhaps trying to use `map(int, ...)` on an input that is already numerical. The underlying logic of identifying the block and shifting it appears sound based on the examples; the issue is technical implementation detail regarding input handling.

**Strategy:**
The strategy is to adjust the code to robustly handle the input sequence, assuming it might be provided as a list or a NumPy array of numbers, not strings. The primary modification will be removing the potentially problematic type conversions (like the explicit `int()` cast inside the `find_object` loop) and ensuring comparisons work correctly with numerical types. The core algorithm of finding the block and shifting remains unchanged.

**Metrics:**

The transformation rule consistently involves shifting the identified object 4 positions to the left.

      value: A single non-zero integer (constant within the block).
      start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins.
      length: The number of digits in the block.
output_structure:
  - type: background
    value: 0
  - type: object
    description: The same object from the input sequence, potentially truncated by boundaries.
    properties:
      value: Same integer value as the input object.
      start_index: The original start_index minus 4.
      length: Same length as the input object, but only elements within the sequence bounds (0-11) are placed.
transformation:
  - action: find_object
    description: Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the first occurrence of a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. Record its value, starting index, and length.
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create a new sequence of length 12, filled entirely with zeros.
  - action: calculate_new_position
    description: Determine the target starting index for the object in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from its starting index in the input sequence.
  - action: place_object
    description: Copy the identified object (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new position.
  - action: handle_boundaries
    description: Ensure that only the parts of the shifted object that fall within the valid index range (0 to 11) of the output sequence are placed. Positions outside the shifted object remain zero.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept an input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the first contiguous block of identical digits that are not zero. If no such block exists (e.g., the input is all zeros), return the initialized output sequence.
4.  Record the non-zero digit (`value`), the starting index (`start_index`), and the number of digits (`length`) of this block.
5.  Calculate the target starting index (`new_start_index`) for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from `start_index`.
6.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `length - 1`:
    a.  Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    b.  If `target_index` is within the valid bounds of the output sequence (0 <= `target_index` < 12), place the `value` at `output_sequence[target_index]`.
7.  Return the final output sequence.
