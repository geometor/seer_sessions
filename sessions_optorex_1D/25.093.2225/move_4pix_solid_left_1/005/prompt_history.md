*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (or lists) of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence contains the same block of non-zero digits as the input, but its position within the sequence has changed. The remaining elements are zeros.

**General Assessment:**

The initial code attempted to implement the core logic identified: find a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift it 4 positions to the left within a sequence of 12 integers. However, it failed on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.

This error typically arises when a NumPy array is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (like a simple `if array:` statement). This suggests that the testing environment is passing the input as a NumPy array, and some part of the code (likely within the `find_object` function or how its results are used) is causing this ambiguity, despite the attempt to convert the input to a Python list using `list(input_grid)`.

The manual analysis and the code execution performed to gather metrics confirm that the underlying transformation rule (find the block, calculate its properties, determine the new start position by subtracting 4) correctly maps inputs to outputs for all provided training examples.

Therefore, the strategy is to maintain the established transformation logic but refine the implementation in the coder phase to be fully robust to receiving NumPy arrays as input, ensuring all comparisons and conditional checks handle potential NumPy data types correctly, even after the explicit conversion to a list.

**Metrics:**

The following metrics were gathered by simulating the `find_object` function and the shift calculation on the training inputs:


```json

    "example": 1,

  {
    "example": 2,
    "input_array": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
    "object_value": 7,
    "object_start_index": 8,
    "object_length": 1,
    "calculated_output_start_index": 4
  },
  {
    "example": 3,
    "input_array": [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0],
    "object_value": 6,
    "object_start_index": 4,
    "object_length": 5,
    "calculated_output_start_index": 0
  },
  {
    "example": 4,
    "input_array": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0],
    "object_value": 6,
    "object_start_index": 6,
    "object_length": 5,
    "calculated_output_start_index": 2
  },
  {
    "example": 5,
    "input_array": [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    "object_value": 5,
    "object_start_index": 4,
    "object_length": 1,
    "calculated_output_start_index": 0
  },
  {
    "example": 6,
    "input_array": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
    "object_value": 2,
    "object_start_index": 5,
    "object_length": 7,
    "calculated_output_start_index": 1
  },
  {
    "example": 7,
    "input_array": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0],
    "object_value": 9,
    "object_start_index": 9,
    "object_length": 2,
    "calculated_output_start_index": 5
  }
]
```

These metrics confirm the core logic: the object identification (value, start, length) and the calculation of the new start index (old start index - 4) are consistent and correct across all examples.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. Record its digit value, its starting index, and its length.
3.  If no such block is found (e.g., the input is all zeros), the output remains all zeros.
4.  If a block is found, calculate its new starting index by subtracting 4 from its original starting index.
5.  Iterate `length` times, corresponding to each digit in the identified block:
    *   Calculate the target index in the output sequence for the current digit (new starting index + iteration counter).
    *   If the target index is valid (between 0 and 11, inclusive), place the block's digit value at that position in the output sequence.
6.  Return the modified output sequence.
