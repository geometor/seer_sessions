            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The primary issue identified across all examples is a type mismatch error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). This indicates that the `transform` function was designed expecting a string input which it would then split into numbers, but during testing, it received a NumPy array directly. The underlying logic of identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical digits and shifting it left by 4 positions appears consistent across all examples based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The strategy for resolution is straightforward: modify the `transform` function to accept a list or array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`). The core transformation logic (finding the block and shifting it) should remain the same.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The transformation rule involves identifying a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 4 positions to the left. Let's analyze each example:\n\n    | Example   | Input Sequence                                | Identified Block (Value, Start, Length) | Output Sequence                               | Expected Output Start (Input Start - 4) | Consistent? |\n    | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------- |\n    | train_1   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | (3, 4, 3)                               | `[3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 0                                       | Yes         |\n    | train_2   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]`      | (7, 8, 1)                               | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 4                                       | Yes         |\n    | train_3   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0]`      | (6, 4, 5)                               | `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 0                                       | Yes         |\n    | train_4   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0]`      | (6, 6, 5)                               | `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 2                                       | Yes         |\n    | train_5   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | (5, 4, 1)                               | `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 0                                       | Yes         |\n    | train_6   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`      | (2, 5, 7)                               | `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 1                                       | Yes         |\n    | train_7   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]`      | (9, 9, 2)                               | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 5                                       | Yes         |\n\n    The analysis confirms the transformation rule is consistently applied: locate the block, determine its start index, and place it in the output starting at `start_index - 4`. The error reported during execution is solely due to the input type mismatch and not a flaw in the perceived transformation logic.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
