*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (or lists) of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   Each input sequence contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence contains the same block of non-zero digits as the input, but its position within the sequence has changed. The remaining elements are zeros.
*   **YAML Facts:**

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers within the input sequence. Note its starting position, length, and the digit value.
    2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initially filled with zeros.
    3.  Calculate the new starting position for the block by subtracting 4 from its original starting position in the input.
    4.  Place the identified block of non-zero digits into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new position. Ensure the block maintains its original length and digit value.

*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue identified across all examples is a type mismatch error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). This indicates that the `transform` function was designed expecting a string input which it would then split into numbers, but during testing, it received a NumPy array directly. The underlying logic of identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical digits and shifting it left by 4 positions appears consistent across all examples based on visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The strategy for resolution is straightforward: modify the `transform` function to accept a list or array of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`). The core transformation logic (finding the block and shifting it) should remain the same.

*   **Metrics:**
    The transformation rule involves identifying a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 4 positions to the left. Let's analyze each example:

    | Example   | Input Sequence                                | Identified Block (Value, Start, Length) | Output Sequence                               | Expected Output Start (Input Start - 4) | Consistent? |

    | train_6   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`      | (2, 5, 7)                               | `[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 1                                       | Yes         |
    | train_7   | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0]`      | (9, 9, 2)                               | `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`      | 5                                       | Yes         |

    The analysis confirms the transformation rule is consistently applied: locate the block, determine its start index, and place it in the output starting at `start_index - 4`. The error reported during execution is solely due to the input type mismatch and not a flaw in the perceived transformation logic.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers within the input sequence. Determine its digit value, its starting index (position), and its length.
    3.  Create a new output sequence of length 12, initially filled entirely with zeros.
    4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from its starting index in the input sequence.
    5.  Copy the identified block of non-zero digits (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target starting index. Ensure that you only write digits within the valid bounds (index 0 to 11) of the output sequence.
