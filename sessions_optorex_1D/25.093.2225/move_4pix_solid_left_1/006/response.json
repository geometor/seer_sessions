            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: find a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift it 4 positions to the left within a sequence of length 12, filling the remaining positions with zeros. All provided training examples consistently follow this rule.\n\nThe errors reported (`only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`) during testing strongly indicate a data type mismatch between what the Python code expects and what the testing environment provides. Specifically, the code seems to be attempting to convert an element (which might already be a number, possibly a NumPy integer type) into a standard Python integer using `int()`, or perhaps trying to use `map(int, ...)` on an input that is already numerical. The underlying logic of identifying the block and shifting it appears sound based on the examples; the issue is technical implementation detail regarding input handling.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe strategy is to adjust the code to robustly handle the input sequence, assuming it might be provided as a list or a NumPy array of numbers, not strings. The primary modification will be removing the potentially problematic type conversions (like the explicit `int()` cast inside the `find_object` loop) and ensuring comparisons work correctly with numerical types. The core algorithm of finding the block and shifting remains unchanged.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe transformation rule consistently involves shifting the identified object 4 positions to the left.\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                      | Object Value | Object Start Index | Object Length | New Start Index (Start - 4) | Expected Output                     | Matches Rule |\n| :------ | :---------------------------------- | :----------- | :----------------- | :------------ | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----------- |\n| train_1 | `0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0`         | 3            | 4                  | 3             | 0                           | `3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`         | Yes          |\n| train_2 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0`         | 7            | 8                  | 1             | 4                           | `0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`         | Yes          |\n| train_3 | `0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0`         | 6            | 4                  | 5             | 0                           | `6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`         | Yes          |\n| train_4 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0`         | 6            | 6                  | 5             | 2                           | `0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0`         | Yes          |\n| train_5 | `0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`         | 5            | 4                  | 1             | 0                           | `5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`         | Yes          |\n| train_6 | `0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`         | 2            | 5                  | 7             | 1                           | `0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0`         | Yes          |\n| train_7 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0`         | 9            | 9                  | 2             | 5                           | `0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0`         | Yes          |\n\n*No code execution is needed to verify these metrics as they are derived directly from observation and simple arithmetic based on the hypothesized rule.*\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
