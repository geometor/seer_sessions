task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    length: 12
    element_type: integer
    range: 0-9
input_structure:
  - type: background
    value: 0
  - type: object
    description: The first contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      value: A single non-zero integer (constant within the block).
      start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins.
      length: The number of digits in the block.
output_structure:
  - type: background
    value: 0
  - type: object
    description: The same object from the input sequence, potentially truncated by boundaries.
    properties:
      value: Same integer value as the input object.
      start_index: The original start_index minus 4.
      length: Same length as the input object, but only elements within the sequence bounds (0-11) are placed.
transformation:
  - action: find_object
    description: Scan the input sequence from left to right to find the first occurrence of a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. Record its value, starting index, and length.
  - action: initialize_output
    description: Create a new sequence of length 12, filled entirely with zeros.
  - action: calculate_new_position
    description: Determine the target starting index for the object in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from its starting index in the input sequence.
  - action: place_object
    description: Copy the identified object (using its value and length) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new position.
  - action: handle_boundaries
    description: Ensure that only the parts of the shifted object that fall within the valid index range (0 to 11) of the output sequence are placed. Positions outside the shifted object remain zero.
