"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers by identifying a single contiguous 
block of identical non-zero digits and shifting this block exactly 4 positions 
to the left. Positions outside the shifted block in the output sequence are 
filled with zeros. Elements shifted beyond the left boundary (index < 0) are discarded.
