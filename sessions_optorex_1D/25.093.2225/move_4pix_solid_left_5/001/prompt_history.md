*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are lists (or sequences) of single-digit integers.
    *   The length of the input and output sequences appears to be constant (12 elements in all examples).
    *   Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros.
    *   The output sequence is formed by shifting this non-zero block to the left by a fixed amount.
    *   The rest of the positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros.
    *   The non-zero digits observed are 2, 4, 7, and 9.
    *   The amount of the left shift appears to be consistently 4 positions.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_elements:
      - type: sequence
        role: input
        properties:
          - data_type: integer
          - element_range: 0-9
          - length: 12
          - structure: contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits surrounded by zeros.
      - type: sequence
        role: output
        properties:
          - data_type: integer
          - element_range: 0-9
          - length: 12
          - structure: derived from input by shifting the non-zero block.
    transformation:
      action: identify_block
      input: input sequence
      target: contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
      parameters:
        - block_value: the non-zero digit
        - start_index: index of the first element of the block
        - end_index: index of the last element of the block
        - length: number of elements in the block
    transformation:
      action: shift_block_left
      input: identified block
      parameters:
        - shift_amount: 4 positions
      output: modified sequence
      details:
        - Create a new sequence of the same length as the input, initialized with zeros.
        - Calculate the new start index for the block: `new_start_index = start_index - 4`.
        - Place the identified block into the new sequence starting at `new_start_index`.
    relationships:
      - The output sequence is a direct transformation of the input sequence.
      - The non-zero block maintains its elements and order but changes its position.
      - The shift amount (4) is constant across all examples.
      - Zeros act as background/padding.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer. Record its value (`block_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
    4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of integers equal to `block_value`. Record the index of the last element of the block (`end_index`).
    5.  Calculate the length of the block: `length = end_index - start_index + 1`.
    6.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index - 4`.
    7.  Copy the identified block (from `start_index` to `end_index` in the input) into the output sequence, starting at `new_start_index` and extending for `length` positions.
    8.  Return the resulting output sequence.
