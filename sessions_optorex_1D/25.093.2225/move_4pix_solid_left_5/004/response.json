            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously appears correct and consistent across all training examples: identify a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shift this block exactly 4 positions to the left within a sequence of fixed length (12), filling all other positions with zeros.\n\nThe errors reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly indicate a technical issue related to data types. The provided Python code was likely tested in an environment where the input sequences were passed as NumPy arrays rather than standard Python lists. Comparisons like `val != 0` or `sequence[i] == block_value` are ambiguous when `val` or `sequence[i]` is an array element being compared to a single integer if the underlying structure is a NumPy array being treated element-wise in a boolean context implicitly.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Logic:** Use `tool_code` to systematically analyze each example, extracting metrics about the non-zero block (start, end, value, length) and verifying that shifting this block left by 4 positions correctly produces the corresponding output.\n2.  **Address Error:** The natural language program and the conceptual understanding remain valid. The fix required is likely in the implementation (the `coder` phase) to handle NumPy array inputs gracefully, either by converting them to lists first or by using NumPy-aware comparisons and operations. The dreamer's output (YAML, Natural Language Program) needs to be robust to this potential input format variation but the core logic doesn't change.\n3.  **Refine Descriptions:** Ensure the YAML facts and Natural Language Program are precise and explicitly state the shift amount and the handling of boundary conditions (elements shifted off the left edge are lost, new positions on the right are filled with zeros).\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nThe following metrics were derived by analyzing the input/output pairs, confirming the transformation rule. The `tool_code` execution above verified these findings.\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                               | Output Sequence                              | Block Value | Block Start Index | Block End Index | Block Length | New Start Index (Start - 4) | Output Matches Logic |\n| :------ | :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :---------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------- |\n| 1       | `[0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | `[7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 7           | 4                 | 5               | 2            | 0                           | Yes                  |\n| 2       | `[0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0]`                  | `[0,9,9,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 9           | 5                 | 10              | 6            | 1                           | Yes                  |\n| 3       | `[0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | `[2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 2           | 4                 | 5               | 2            | 0                           | Yes                  |\n| 4       | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`                  | `[0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0]`                  | 7           | 5                 | 11              | 7            | 1                           | Yes                  |\n| 5       | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0]`                  | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 9           | 10                | 10              | 1            | 6                           | Yes                  |\n| 6       | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7]`                  | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]`                  | 7           | 10                | 11              | 2            | 6                           | Yes                  |\n| 7       | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0]`                  | `[0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`                  | 4           | 8                 | 8               | 1            | 4                           | Yes                  |\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
