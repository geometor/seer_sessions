task_elements:
  - type: sequence
    role: input
    properties:
      - data_type: integer_sequence # Can be list or NumPy array
      - element_range: 0-9
      - length: 12
      - structure: Contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, padded with zeros.
  - type: sequence
    role: output
    properties:
      - data_type: integer_sequence # Matches input type
      - element_range: 0-9
      - length: 12
      - structure: Derived from input by shifting the non-zero block.
  - object: non_zero_block
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero integer forming the block (e.g., 2, 4, 7, 9).
      - start_index: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the input sequence.
      - end_index: The 0-based index of the last element of the block in the input sequence.
      - length: The number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
transformation:
  action: identify_block
  input: input sequence
  target: contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
  output: block_value, start_index, end_index, length
transformation:
  action: construct_output_sequence
  parameters:
    - sequence_length: 12 (constant)
    - shift_amount: 4 (constant, to the left)
  inputs:
    - block_value
    - start_index
    - length
  process:
    - Initialize an output sequence of `sequence_length` with all zeros.
    - Calculate the new starting index for the block: `new_start_index = start_index - shift_amount`.
    - Iterate from `i = 0` to `length - 1`:
      - Calculate the target index in the output: `output_idx = new_start_index + i`.
      - If `0 <= output_idx < sequence_length`:
        - Set `output_sequence[output_idx] = block_value`.
  output: modified sequence
relationships:
  - The output sequence is a direct transformation of the input sequence.
  - The non-zero block maintains its value and length but changes its position.
  - The shift amount (4 positions left) is constant across all examples.
  - Zeros act as background/padding and fill positions not occupied by the shifted block.
  - Elements of the block shifted to an index less than 0 are discarded.
