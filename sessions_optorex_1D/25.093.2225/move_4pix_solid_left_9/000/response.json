Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence is generated by shifting this non-zero block exactly 4 positions to the left within the sequence. The length of the sequence remains unchanged, and the vacated positions are filled with zeros.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
