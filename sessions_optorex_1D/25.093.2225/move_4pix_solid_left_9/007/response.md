```python
"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array by identifying the single contiguous block of
identical non-zero digits and shifting this block exactly 4 positions to the left.
The output array has the same size as the input, with positions outside the
shifted block filled with zeros. If the shift causes the block to extend beyond
the left boundary (index < 0), those elements are clipped (not included in the output).
