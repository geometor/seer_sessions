*   **Perception:** The task involves processing sequences of single-digit numbers. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence is generated by shifting this non-zero block exactly 4 positions to the left within the sequence. The length of the sequence remains unchanged, and the vacated positions are filled with zeros.

    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
    2.  Initialize the output list as a list of zeros with the same length as the input list.
    3.  Iterate through the input list to find the first occurrence of a non-zero digit. Record its value (let's call it `block_value`) and its index (let's call it `start_index`).
    4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` to determine the length of the contiguous block of `block_value` digits (let's call it `block_length`).
    5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the output list: `new_start_index = start_index - 4`.
    6.  Iterate from `i = 0` to `block_length - 1`. For each `i`, set the element at index `new_start_index + i` in the output list to `block_value`.
    7.  Format the output list back into a space-separated string.
