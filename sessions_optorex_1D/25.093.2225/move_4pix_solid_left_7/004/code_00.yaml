Task: Sequence Transformation (Left Shift)

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Constraint: Contains exactly one contiguous block of identical, non-zero integers. The rest are zeros.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Constraint: Derived from InputSequence. Contains the same non-zero block, shifted. The rest are zeros.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Sub-sequence
      Properties:
        - Value (int): The non-zero integer value (e.g., 1, 7, 8, 6, 2, 5). Constant between Input and Output.
        - Length (int): The number of elements in the block (e.g., 4, 1, 6). Constant between Input and Output.
        - InputStartIndex (int): The 0-based index where the block begins in the InputSequence.
        - InputEndIndex (int): The 0-based index where the block ends in the InputSequence.
        - OutputStartIndex (int): The 0-based index where the block begins in the OutputSequence.
        - OutputEndIndex (int): The 0-based index where the block ends in the OutputSequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeftBlock
  - Target: NonZeroBlock
  - Amount (int): 4 positions

Relationship:
  - The OutputSequence is generated by taking the InputSequence, identifying the NonZeroBlock, and relocating it.
  - OutputStartIndex = InputStartIndex - 4
  - OutputEndIndex = InputEndIndex - 4
  - The Value and Length of the NonZeroBlock remain unchanged.
  - Elements of the OutputSequence corresponding to the shifted block positions take the block's Value.
  - All other elements of the OutputSequence are 0.
  - If the calculated OutputStartIndex is less than 0, the block placement starts effectively at index 0, and the beginning part of the block is truncated (though this doesn't explicitly happen in the examples, the logic implies it for a generic left shift; however, the observed *result* simply places the block starting at the calculated index, clamped within bounds 0-11). Example: In train_2, start 4 shifts to start 0.
  - If the calculated OutputEndIndex exceeds 11 (the max index), the block placement ends at index 11, and the end part of the block is truncated (not observed in examples).
