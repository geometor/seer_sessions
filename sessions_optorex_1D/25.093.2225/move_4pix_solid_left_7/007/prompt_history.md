## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers.
Each input sequence consists predominantly of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
The output sequence is generated by moving this block of non-zero integers.
The transformation consistently shifts the block 4 positions to the left.
The length of the sequence and the values within the block remain unchanged.
Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Properties:
        - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
        - Remaining elements are zero.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Properties:
        - Contains the same block of non-zero integers as the input.
        - Remaining elements are zero.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Sub-sequence of Integers
      Properties:
        - Consists of identical non-zero integers.
        - Contiguous within the sequence.
        - Value: The non-zero integer value.
        - Length: Number of elements in the block.
        - StartIndex: Index of the first element of the block in the InputSequence.
        - EndIndex: Index of the last element of the block in the InputSequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft
  - Amount: 4 positions
  - Object: NonZeroBlock

Relationship:
  - The OutputSequence is derived from the InputSequence by applying the ShiftLeft action to the NonZeroBlock.
  - The StartIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputSequence is `StartIndex (Input) - 4`.
  - The EndIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputSequence is `EndIndex (Input) - 4`.
  - All other positions in the OutputSequence are zero.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence. Determine its value, length, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initialized with all zeros.
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 4 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
4.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The core issue identified is a `ValueError` related to NumPy array boolean comparisons within the `find_nonzero_block` function or its usage in `transform`. This error prevents the code from executing correctly on any example. The fundamental logic identified previously (finding a contiguous non-zero block and shifting it left by 4 positions) appears consistent across the examples based on visual inspection.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Debug `find_nonzero_block`:** Rewrite the block finding logic to avoid ambiguous NumPy boolean comparisons. Standard Python list iteration and conditional checks should suffice and avoid this error.
2.  **Verify Transformation Logic:** Re-run the corrected logic (mentally or with code execution) on all examples to confirm the "shift left by 4" rule holds universally and handle boundary conditions correctly (i.e., parts of the block shifted beyond index 0 are discarded).
3.  **Gather Metrics:** Use `tool_code` with a *corrected* `find_nonzero_block` logic to extract precise details (value, start index, length) for input and output blocks across all examples.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on the confirmed logic and metrics.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's define a function based on the intended logic (but avoiding the NumPy error) to extract block information.

## Updated Documented Facts

The code execution confirms the initial hypothesis. The transformation consistently involves finding the single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shifting it 4 positions to the left. Elements shifted beyond the start of the list (index < 0) are discarded.


```yaml
Task: Sequence Block Shift

Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Role: Input or Output
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Contiguous sub-sequence within a Sequence
      Properties:
        - Elements: Identical non-zero integers
        - Value: The integer value of the elements (e.g., 1, 7, 8)
        - StartIndex: The 0-based index of the first element in the block within its Sequence.
        - Length: The number of elements in the block.
        - Constraint: There is exactly one such block in the Input Sequence.
  - Background:
      Type: Integer
      Value: 0
      Role: Fills positions in the Sequence outside the NonZeroBlock.

Action:
  - Name: Identify NonZeroBlock
  - Input: Input Sequence
  - Output: Value, StartIndex, Length of the NonZeroBlock
  - Details: Iterates through the sequence to find the first non-zero element, then determines the length of the contiguous block of that same value.
  
  - Name: Shift Block Left
  - Amount: 4 positions
  - Object: NonZeroBlock identified from Input Sequence
  - Result: A new theoretical position for the block (NewStartIndex = StartIndex - 4).

  - Name: Construct Output Sequence
  - Input: Length of Input Sequence (12), Background Value (0), NonZeroBlock details (Value, Length), NewStartIndex
  - Process:
      1. Initialize an empty sequence of length 12 with the Background Value (0).
      2. Iterate from `i = 0` to `Length - 1` of the NonZeroBlock.
      3. Calculate the target index in the output: `TargetIndex = NewStartIndex + i`.
      4. If `0 <= TargetIndex < 12`, set the element at `TargetIndex` in the output sequence to the NonZeroBlock's Value.
      5. Elements of the block for which `TargetIndex` is out of bounds are effectively discarded.
  - Output: The final Output Sequence.

Relationship:
  - The Output Sequence is generated by applying the 'Identify NonZeroBlock', 'Shift Block Left', and 'Construct Output Sequence' actions to the Input Sequence.
  - The NonZeroBlock's value and potentially its length (if truncated by the left boundary) are preserved in the Output Sequence, but its position is shifted.
```


## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize:** Create a new output sequence of length 12, filled entirely with zeros.
2.  **Identify Block:** Scan the input sequence to find the single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. Record its value, its starting index, and its length.
3.  **Calculate Target Position:** Determine the target starting index for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from its starting index in the input sequence.
4.  **Place Block:** Iterate through the length of the identified block. For each element within the block (from index 0 to length-1):
    a.  Calculate its potential destination index in the output sequence by adding the current element's relative index within the block to the calculated target starting index.
    b.  Check if this destination index is valid (i.e., between 0 and 11, inclusive).
    c.  If the destination index is valid, place the block's value at that index in the output sequence. (If the index is invalid, this part of the block is effectively dropped).
5.  **Finalize:** The constructed output sequence is the result.
