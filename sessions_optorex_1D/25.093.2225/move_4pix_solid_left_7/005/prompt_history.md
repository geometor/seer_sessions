## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers.
Each input sequence consists predominantly of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
The output sequence is generated by moving this block of non-zero integers.
The transformation consistently shifts the block 4 positions to the left.
The length of the sequence and the values within the block remain unchanged.
Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Properties:
        - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
        - Remaining elements are zero.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Properties:
        - Contains the same block of non-zero integers as the input.
        - Remaining elements are zero.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Sub-sequence of Integers
      Properties:
        - Consists of identical non-zero integers.
        - Contiguous within the sequence.
        - Value: The non-zero integer value.
        - Length: Number of elements in the block.
        - StartIndex: Index of the first element of the block in the InputSequence.
        - EndIndex: Index of the last element of the block in the InputSequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft
  - Amount: 4 positions
  - Object: NonZeroBlock

Relationship:
  - The OutputSequence is derived from the InputSequence by applying the ShiftLeft action to the NonZeroBlock.
  - The StartIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputSequence is `StartIndex (Input) - 4`.
  - The EndIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputSequence is `EndIndex (Input) - 4`.
  - All other positions in the OutputSequence are zero.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence. Determine its value, length, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initialized with all zeros.
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 4 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
4.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The previous attempt correctly identified the core transformation rule: locating a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers and shifting it 4 positions to the left within a fixed-length sequence of 12 elements. The provided Python code aimed to implement this logic using NumPy for potentially efficient array operations.

However, the code consistently failed across all examples with a NumPy error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This indicates that somewhere in the code, a NumPy array (likely a boolean array resulting from a comparison) was used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement) without explicit reduction using `.any()` (is at least one element true?) or `.all()` (are all elements true?).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Pinpoint the Error:** Although the exact line number is missing, the error commonly occurs when conditions like `if array1 == array2:` or `if array > value:` are used without aggregation. The provided code seems to use `np.all()` correctly in the validation line, suggesting the error might be subtler, perhaps related to how inputs are handled or an unexpected edge case triggered by the test environment. For this phase, we will assume the *intended* logic remains finding and shifting the block.
2.  **Verify Transformation Rule:** Re-examine the examples to confirm the "shift left by 4" rule holds universally and check for edge cases (e.g., block near the start, block length).
3.  **Gather Accurate Metrics:** Use `tool_code` to reliably extract the properties (value, start index, length, end index) of the non-zero block for each input example. This will provide concrete data to base the refined description on.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program based on the confirmed rule and metrics, ensuring they accurately describe the transformation shown in the examples, independent of the previous code's implementation error. The focus remains on the *what* (transformation rule) rather than the *how* (specific Python implementation details causing the error).

## Metrics Gathering

## Documented Facts

Based on the examples and the metrics gathered, the transformation consistently involves shifting a block of non-zero numbers.


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation (Left Shift)

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Constraint: Contains exactly one contiguous block of identical, non-zero integers. The rest are zeros.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Constraint: Derived from InputSequence. Contains the same non-zero block, shifted. The rest are zeros.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Sub-sequence
      Properties:
        - Value (int): The non-zero integer value (e.g., 1, 7, 8, 6, 2, 5). Constant between Input and Output.
        - Length (int): The number of elements in the block (e.g., 4, 1, 6). Constant between Input and Output.
        - InputStartIndex (int): The 0-based index where the block begins in the InputSequence.
        - InputEndIndex (int): The 0-based index where the block ends in the InputSequence.
        - OutputStartIndex (int): The 0-based index where the block begins in the OutputSequence.
        - OutputEndIndex (int): The 0-based index where the block ends in the OutputSequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeftBlock
  - Target: NonZeroBlock
  - Amount (int): 4 positions

Relationship:
  - The OutputSequence is generated by taking the InputSequence, identifying the NonZeroBlock, and relocating it.
  - OutputStartIndex = InputStartIndex - 4
  - OutputEndIndex = InputEndIndex - 4
  - The Value and Length of the NonZeroBlock remain unchanged.
  - Elements of the OutputSequence corresponding to the shifted block positions take the block's Value.
  - All other elements of the OutputSequence are 0.
  - If the calculated OutputStartIndex is less than 0, the block placement starts effectively at index 0, and the beginning part of the block is truncated (though this doesn't explicitly happen in the examples, the logic implies it for a generic left shift; however, the observed *result* simply places the block starting at the calculated index, clamped within bounds 0-11). Example: In train_2, start 4 shifts to start 0.
  - If the calculated OutputEndIndex exceeds 11 (the max index), the block placement ends at index 11, and the end part of the block is truncated (not observed in examples).

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new sequence of 12 zeros, representing the initial state of the output.
2.  **Identify Block:** Scan the input sequence to find the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. Record its non-zero value (`V`), its starting index (`S_in`), and its length (`L`).
3.  **Calculate New Position:** Determine the target starting index (`S_out`) for the block in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from the input starting index: `S_out = S_in - 4`.
4.  **Place Block:** Iterate from `i = 0` up to `L-1` (covering each element of the block):
    *   Calculate the target index in the output sequence: `target_idx = S_out + i`.
    *   Check if `target_idx` is a valid index within the output sequence (i.e., `0 <= target_idx < 12`).
    *   If the `target_idx` is valid, place the block's value (`V`) at `OutputSequence[target_idx]`.
5.  **Finalize:** The resulting sequence after placing the block is the final output.
