## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers.
Each input sequence consists predominantly of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
The output sequence is generated by moving this block of non-zero integers.
The transformation consistently shifts the block 4 positions to the left.
The length of the sequence and the values within the block remain unchanged.
Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence. Determine its value, length, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initialized with all zeros.
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 4 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
4.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.

## General Assessment

The core transformation logic identified previously – finding a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shifting it 4 positions to the left – appears consistent across all provided training examples. The error message "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" strongly suggests that the input data, assumed to be a simple list of integers in the `transform` function, might be provided as a NumPy array by the testing environment. Operations like `if input_grid:` or comparisons involving slices might trigger this error if `input_grid` is a NumPy array. The strategy is to:

1.  Confirm the transformation pattern (left shift by 4) across all examples using code execution.
2.  Refine the understanding of the input/output objects and the transformation action.
3.  Update the Natural Language Program to ensure clarity and precision.
4.  Recognize that the subsequent coding phase must handle potential NumPy array inputs or ensure conversion to standard Python lists if list-specific methods are used.

## Gather Metrics

To confirm the pattern, let's analyze each training example to find the block properties and the shift amount.

The analysis confirms that in every training example, the transformation involves identifying a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers and shifting it exactly 4 positions to the left. The value, length, and identity of the block elements remain unchanged. The elements outside the shifted block in the output are zeros.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence (a list/array of 12 integers).
2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first non-zero integer.
4.  If no non-zero integer is found, return the sequence of 12 zeros.
5.  If a non-zero integer is found:
    a.  Record its value (`block_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
    b.  Determine the length (`block_length`) of the contiguous block of this `block_value` starting at `start_index`.
6.  Calculate the target start index in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index - 4`.
7.  Iterate from `i = 0` up to `block_length - 1`:
    a.  Calculate the current index in the output sequence: `output_index = new_start_index + i`.
    b.  Check if `output_index` is within the valid range of the output sequence (0 to 11, inclusive).
    c.  If it is valid, set the element at `output_index` in the output sequence to `block_value`.
8.  Return the modified output sequence.
