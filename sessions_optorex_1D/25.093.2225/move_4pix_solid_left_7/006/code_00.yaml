Task: Sequence Block Shift

Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Role: Input or Output
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Contiguous sub-sequence within a Sequence
      Properties:
        - Elements: Identical non-zero integers
        - Value: The integer value of the elements (e.g., 1, 7, 8)
        - StartIndex: The 0-based index of the first element in the block within its Sequence.
        - Length: The number of elements in the block.
        - Constraint: There is exactly one such block in the Input Sequence.
  - Background:
      Type: Integer
      Value: 0
      Role: Fills positions in the Sequence outside the NonZeroBlock.

Action:
  - Name: Identify NonZeroBlock
  - Input: Input Sequence
  - Output: Value, StartIndex, Length of the NonZeroBlock
  - Details: Iterates through the sequence to find the first non-zero element, then determines the length of the contiguous block of that same value.
  
  - Name: Shift Block Left
  - Amount: 4 positions
  - Object: NonZeroBlock identified from Input Sequence
  - Result: A new theoretical position for the block (NewStartIndex = StartIndex - 4).

  - Name: Construct Output Sequence
  - Input: Length of Input Sequence (12), Background Value (0), NonZeroBlock details (Value, Length), NewStartIndex
  - Process:
      1. Initialize an empty sequence of length 12 with the Background Value (0).
      2. Iterate from `i = 0` to `Length - 1` of the NonZeroBlock.
      3. Calculate the target index in the output: `TargetIndex = NewStartIndex + i`.
      4. If `0 <= TargetIndex < 12`, set the element at `TargetIndex` in the output sequence to the NonZeroBlock's Value.
      5. Elements of the block for which `TargetIndex` is out of bounds are effectively discarded.
  - Output: The final Output Sequence.

Relationship:
  - The Output Sequence is generated by applying the 'Identify NonZeroBlock', 'Shift Block Left', and 'Construct Output Sequence' actions to the Input Sequence.
  - The NonZeroBlock's value and potentially its length (if truncated by the left boundary) are preserved in the Output Sequence, but its position is shifted.
