"""
Transforms an input sequence of 12 integers by finding the single contiguous block 
of identical non-zero integers and shifting this block 4 positions to the left. 
Positions in the output sequence are filled with zeros initially, and then 
populated by the shifted block values where applicable within the sequence boundaries.
