Task: Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Properties:
        - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
        - Remaining elements are zero.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Properties:
        - Contains the same block of non-zero integers as the input.
        - Remaining elements are zero.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Sub-sequence of Integers
      Properties:
        - Consists of identical non-zero integers.
        - Contiguous within the sequence.
        - Value: The non-zero integer value.
        - Length: Number of elements in the block.
        - StartIndex: Index of the first element of the block in the InputSequence.
        - EndIndex: Index of the last element of the block in the InputSequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft
  - Amount: 4 positions
  - Object: NonZeroBlock

Relationship:
  - The OutputSequence is derived from the InputSequence by applying the ShiftLeft action to the NonZeroBlock.
  - The StartIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputSequence is `StartIndex (Input) - 4`.
  - The EndIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputSequence is `EndIndex (Input) - 4`.
  - All other positions in the OutputSequence are zero.
