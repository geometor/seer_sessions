## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of 12 integers.
Each input sequence consists predominantly of zeros, with a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
The output sequence is generated by moving this block of non-zero integers.
The transformation consistently shifts the block 4 positions to the left.
The length of the sequence and the values within the block remain unchanged.
Positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with zeros.

## Documented Facts


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Properties:
        - Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
        - Remaining elements are zero.
  - OutputSequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Length: 12
      Properties:
        - Contains the same block of non-zero integers as the input.
        - Remaining elements are zero.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      Type: Sub-sequence of Integers
      Properties:
        - Consists of identical non-zero integers.
        - Contiguous within the sequence.
        - Value: The non-zero integer value.
        - Length: Number of elements in the block.
        - StartIndex: Index of the first element of the block in the InputSequence.
        - EndIndex: Index of the last element of the block in the InputSequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft
  - Amount: 4 positions
  - Object: NonZeroBlock

Relationship:
  - The OutputSequence is derived from the InputSequence by applying the ShiftLeft action to the NonZeroBlock.
  - The StartIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputSequence is `StartIndex (Input) - 4`.
  - The EndIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the OutputSequence is `EndIndex (Input) - 4`.
  - All other positions in the OutputSequence are zero.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence. Determine its value, length, starting index, and ending index.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length (12), initialized with all zeros.
3.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 4 from its original starting index in the input sequence.
4.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
