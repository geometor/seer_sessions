            "text": "*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: locating a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 12-digit sequence and shifting this block 4 positions to the left. The provided examples consistently follow this rule. The previous code attempt failed due to a syntax error (indentation), not a logical flaw in the perceived transformation. Therefore, the strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule and provide a clear description for the coder, ensuring the logic is correctly translated into executable code without syntax issues.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The previous code failed syntax checks, so execution metrics are unavailable. Manually derived metrics from the training examples:\n\n    | Example | Input Sequence            | Block Value | Block Start Index | Block End Index | Block Length | Output Sequence           | New Block Start | New Block End |\n    | :------ | :------------------------ | :---------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :----------- | :------------------------ | :-------------- | :------------ |\n    | train_1 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7` | 7           | 6                 | 11              | 6            | `0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0` | 2               | 7             |\n    | train_2 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0` | 7           | 7                 | 8               | 2            | `0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` | 3               | 4             |\n    | train_3 | `0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0` | 7           | 5                 | 6               | 2            | `0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` | 1               | 2             |\n    | train_4 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6` | 6           | 9                 | 11              | 3            | `0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0` | 5               | 7             |\n    | train_5 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0` | 1           | 8                 | 10              | 3            | `0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0` | 4               | 6             |\n    | train_6 | `0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0` | 7           | 5                 | 9               | 5            | `0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0` | 1               | 5             |\n    | train_7 | `0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0` | 6           | 5                 | 6               | 2            | `0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` | 1               | 2             |\n\n    **Observations from Metrics:**\n    *   Input/Output sequence length is consistently 12.\n    *   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (values seen: 1, 6, 7).\n    *   The block length varies (2 to 6).\n    *   The transformation consistently shifts the block's start and end indices by -4.\n    *   The non-zero value of the block is preserved in the output.\n    *   All positions outside the shifted block in the output are 0.\n    *   The shifted block always remains within the bounds of the 12-element sequence (minimum new start index is 1).\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
