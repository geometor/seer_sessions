*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: locating a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 12-digit sequence and shifting this block 4 positions to the left. The provided examples consistently follow this rule. The previous code attempt failed due to a syntax error (indentation), not a logical flaw in the perceived transformation. Therefore, the strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule and provide a clear description for the coder, ensuring the logic is correctly translated into executable code without syntax issues.

*   **Metrics:**
    The previous code failed syntax checks, so execution metrics are unavailable. Manually derived metrics from the training examples:

    **Observations from Metrics:**
    *   Input/Output sequence length is consistently 12.
    *   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (values seen: 1, 6, 7).
    *   The block length varies (2 to 6).
    *   The transformation consistently shifts the block's start and end indices by -4.
    *   The non-zero value of the block is preserved in the output.
    *   All positions outside the shifted block in the output are 0.
    *   The shifted block always remains within the bounds of the 12-element sequence (minimum new start index is 1).

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its value (`block_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
    4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` until a digit different from `block_value` (which will be 0 according to the constraints) is found, or the end of the sequence is reached. Record the index of the last digit belonging to the block as `end_index`.
    5.  Calculate the `new_start_index` by subtracting 4 from `start_index`.
    6.  Calculate the `new_end_index` by subtracting 4 from `end_index`.
    7.  Fill the elements of the output sequence from `new_start_index` to `new_end_index` (inclusive) with the `block_value`.
    8.  Return the completed output sequence.
