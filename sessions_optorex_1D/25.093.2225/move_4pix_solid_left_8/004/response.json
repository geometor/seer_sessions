            "text": "*   **General Assessment**:\n    The previous code consistently produced the error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This indicates that the code, likely within the `find_block` function or how `transform` handles its input, is attempting to use a NumPy array in a context where a single boolean value is expected (e.g., `if array:`). This usually happens when comparing NumPy arrays directly or when the input structure isn't handled correctly (e.g., expecting a 1D list but receiving a 2D NumPy array). The core logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it left by 4 positions appears fundamentally correct based on the input/output examples, but the implementation needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the data types provided by the execution environment (likely NumPy arrays). The strategy is to ensure the code explicitly handles NumPy array inputs, flattens them if necessary, and uses element-wise comparisons or appropriate NumPy functions.\n\n*   **Metrics**:\n    The task involves 1D sequences (or grids flattened to 1D) of length 12. The key transformation is identifying a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting it 4 positions to the left.\n\n    | Example | Input Sequence                              | Non-Zero Block (Value, Start, End) | Original Indices | New Indices (Shift Left 4) | Output Sequence                             |\n    | :------ | :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |\n    | train_1 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7`                 | (7, 6, 11)                         | 6-11             | 2-7                        | `0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0`                 |\n    | train_2 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0`                 | (7, 7, 8)                          | 7-8              | 3-4                        | `0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`                 |\n    | train_3 | `0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0`                 | (7, 5, 6)                          | 5-6              | 1-2                        | `0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`                 |\n    | train_4 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6`                 | (6, 9, 11)                         | 9-11             | 5-7                        | `0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0`                 |\n    | train_5 | `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0`                 | (1, 8, 10)                         | 8-10             | 4-6                        | `0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0`                 |\n    | train_6 | `0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0`                 | (7, 5, 9)                          | 5-9              | 1-5                        | `0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0`                 |\n    | train_7 | `0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0`                 | (6, 5, 6)                          | 5-6              | 1-2                        | `0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`                 |\n\n    The error occurred uniformly across all examples, confirming it's a systematic issue with data handling rather than specific input values.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
