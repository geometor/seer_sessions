"""
Identifies the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 12-element 
1D input sequence. Creates a new sequence of 12 zeros. Shifts the identified block 
4 positions to the left and places it into the new sequence at the calculated position. 
Returns the resulting sequence, maintaining the original shape (likely 1x12 or 12).
