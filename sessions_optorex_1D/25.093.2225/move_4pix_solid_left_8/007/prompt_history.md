*   **Perception**: The task involves manipulating sequences of 12 digits. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence is generated by shifting this non-zero block exactly 4 positions to the left. The positions vacated by the shift, as well as the original positions of the leading zeros (up to the new start of the block), are filled with zeros. The length of the sequence remains 12.

*   **Facts**:

          - content: primarily zeros with one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
      - item: block
        properties:
          - type: contiguous sub-sequence
          - content: identical non-zero digits (e.g., 7, 6, 1)

        properties:

        target: block
        details: Subtract 4 from the original start and end indices to determine the new position.
      - action: construct_output
        details:
          - Create a new sequence of 12 zeros.
          - Place the identified block into the new sequence at the calculated new position.
    constraints:
      - The input sequence length is always 12.
      - There is exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input.
      - The shift amount is consistently 4 positions to the left.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Read the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits. Record its value, its start index, and its end index in the input sequence.
    3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
    4.  Calculate the new start index for the block by subtracting 4 from its original start index.
    5.  Calculate the new end index for the block by subtracting 4 from its original end index.
    6.  Copy the identified block (using its recorded value) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new start index and ending at the calculated new end index.
    7.  Return the modified output sequence.

*   **General Assessment:** The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation: locating a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 12-digit sequence and shifting this block 4 positions to the left. The provided examples consistently follow this rule. The previous code attempt failed due to a syntax error (indentation), not a logical flaw in the perceived transformation. Therefore, the strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule and provide a clear description for the coder, ensuring the logic is correctly translated into executable code without syntax issues.

*   **Metrics:**
    The previous code failed syntax checks, so execution metrics are unavailable. Manually derived metrics from the training examples:

    **Observations from Metrics:**
    *   Input/Output sequence length is consistently 12.
    *   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (values seen: 1, 6, 7).
    *   The block length varies (2 to 6).
    *   The transformation consistently shifts the block's start and end indices by -4.
    *   The non-zero value of the block is preserved in the output.
    *   All positions outside the shifted block in the output are 0.
    *   The shifted block always remains within the bounds of the 12-element sequence (minimum new start index is 1).

*   **Facts:**

        details: Initialize a new sequence of 12 zeros.
      - action: calculate_new_indices
        inputs:
            - original start index
            - original end index
        details: Subtract 4 from the original start index to get the new start index. Subtract 4 from the original end index to get the new end index.
      - action: place_block
        target: output sequence
        details: Copy the identified block (using its non-zero value) into the output sequence, spanning from the calculated new start index to the calculated new end index (inclusive).
    constraints:
      - Input sequence length is always 12.
      - Exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits exists in the input.
      - The shift amount is fixed at 4 positions to the left.
      - The shifted block fits entirely within the 12 positions of the output sequence.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 digits.
    2.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 zeros.
    3.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first non-zero digit. Record its value (`block_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
    4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` until a digit different from `block_value` (which will be 0 according to the constraints) is found, or the end of the sequence is reached. Record the index of the last digit belonging to the block as `end_index`.
    5.  Calculate the `new_start_index` by subtracting 4 from `start_index`.
    6.  Calculate the `new_end_index` by subtracting 4 from `end_index`.
    7.  Fill the elements of the output sequence from `new_start_index` to `new_end_index` (inclusive) with the `block_value`.
    8.  Return the completed output sequence.
