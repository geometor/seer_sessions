Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The output sequence is generated by shifting this non-zero block exactly 4 positions to the left. The positions vacated by the shift, as well as the original positions of the leading zeros (up to the new start of the block), are filled with zeros. The length of the sequence remains 12.\n\n*   **Facts**:\n    "
