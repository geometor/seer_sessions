## General Assessment and Strategy

The primary issue identified from the test results is an input type mismatch. The previous `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_sequence_str: str`), based perhaps on the initial presentation format. However, the execution environment consistently passed a different data type (indicated by the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`, suggesting a NumPy array or similar sequence type like a list of integers was provided directly).

The core transformation logic hypothesized previously (identifying a single contiguous block of non-zero identical digits and shifting it 4 positions to the left) appears consistent across all provided training examples when analyzed manually.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** The Natural Language Program and subsequent code implementation must assume the input is a sequence of integers (e.g., a Python list) rather than a string requiring parsing.
2.  **Validate Transformation Rule:** Confirm the "left shift by 4" rule holds for all examples by analyzing block positions.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected input type assumption and the validated transformation rule.

## Metrics and Analysis

Let's analyze the block characteristics and shifts for each training example:

| Example | Input Sequence                             | Input Block (Val, Start, End, Len) | Output Sequence                            | Output Block (Val, Start, End, Len) | Shift (Input Start - Output Start) |
| :------ | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| train_1 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]`              | (7, 6, 11, 6)                      | `[0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 2, 7, 6)                        | 6 - 2 = 4                          |
| train_2 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0]`              | (7, 7, 8, 2)                       | `[0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 3, 4, 2)                        | 7 - 3 = 4                          |
| train_3 | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 5, 6, 2)                       | `[0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 1, 2, 2)                        | 5 - 1 = 4                          |
| train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]`              | (6, 9, 11, 3)                      | `[0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]`              | (6, 5, 7, 3)                        | 9 - 5 = 4                          |
| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]`              | (1, 8, 10, 3)                      | `[0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (1, 4, 6, 3)                        | 8 - 4 = 4                          |
| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]`              | (7, 5, 9, 5)                       | `[0,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 1, 5, 5)                        | 5 - 1 = 4                          |
| train_7 | `[0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (6, 5, 6, 2)                       | `[0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (6, 1, 2, 2)                        | 5 - 1 = 4                          |

The analysis confirms that across all training examples, the transformation involves identifying the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting its starting position exactly 4 indices to the left. The block's value and length remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a list of 12 integers (`input_sequence`).
2.  Initialize an `output_sequence` as a list of 12 zeros.
3.  Iterate through the `input_sequence` to find the start index, end index, and value of the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
4.  If a block is found:
    a.  Calculate the `new_start_index` by subtracting 4 from the block's original start index.
    b.  Calculate the `new_end_index` by subtracting 4 from the block's original end index.
    c.  Iterate from `new_start_index` to `new_end_index` (inclusive). For each index `i` in this range, set `output_sequence[i]` to the block's value.
5.  Return the `output_sequence`.
