            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe primary issue identified from the test results is an input type mismatch. The previous `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_sequence_str: str`), based perhaps on the initial presentation format. However, the execution environment consistently passed a different data type (indicated by the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`, suggesting a NumPy array or similar sequence type like a list of integers was provided directly).\n\nThe core transformation logic hypothesized previously (identifying a single contiguous block of non-zero identical digits and shifting it 4 positions to the left) appears consistent across all provided training examples when analyzed manually.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Input Handling:** The Natural Language Program and subsequent code implementation must assume the input is a sequence of integers (e.g., a Python list) rather than a string requiring parsing.\n2.  **Validate Transformation Rule:** Confirm the \"left shift by 4\" rule holds for all examples by analyzing block positions.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the corrected input type assumption and the validated transformation rule.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the block characteristics and shifts for each training example:\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                             | Input Block (Val, Start, End, Len) | Output Sequence                            | Output Block (Val, Start, End, Len) | Shift (Input Start - Output Start) |\n| :------ | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7]`              | (7, 6, 11, 6)                      | `[0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 2, 7, 6)                        | 6 - 2 = 4                          |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0]`              | (7, 7, 8, 2)                       | `[0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 3, 4, 2)                        | 7 - 3 = 4                          |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 5, 6, 2)                       | `[0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 1, 2, 2)                        | 5 - 1 = 4                          |\n| train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6]`              | (6, 9, 11, 3)                      | `[0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0]`              | (6, 5, 7, 3)                        | 9 - 5 = 4                          |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]`              | (1, 8, 10, 3)                      | `[0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (1, 4, 6, 3)                        | 8 - 4 = 4                          |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,0,0]`              | (7, 5, 9, 5)                       | `[0,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (7, 1, 5, 5)                        | 5 - 1 = 4                          |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (6, 5, 6, 2)                       | `[0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`              | (6, 1, 2, 2)                        | 5 - 1 = 4                          |\n\nThe analysis confirms that across all training examples, the transformation involves identifying the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits and shifting its starting position exactly 4 indices to the left.
