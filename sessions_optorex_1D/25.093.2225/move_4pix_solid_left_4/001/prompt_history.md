Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
*   **Objects:** The primary objects are the sequences themselves and the contiguous blocks of non-zero integers within them. The zeros act as a background or padding.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Sequences have a fixed length of 12.
    *   Blocks consist of one or more identical non-zero digits.
    *   Blocks have a starting position (index) and a length.
*   **Action:** The core action is shifting the position of the non-zero block within the sequence.
*   **Relationship:** The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by repositioning the non-zero block. The block itself (the digits and their order) remains unchanged. The shift amount appears constant across examples.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits within a sequence of fixed length."
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - contains: primarily zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers
      - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence
      - content: remains unchanged during transformation
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    input: input sequence
    output: the non-zero block and its start index
  - name: calculate_new_position
    input: original start index
    output: new start index (original start index - 4)
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - block
      - new start index
      - sequence length (12)
    output: output sequence (block placed at new position, padded with zeros)
relationships:
  - The output sequence contains the same non-zero block as the input sequence.
  - The start position of the block in the output sequence is consistently 4 positions to the left of its start position in the input sequence.
constants:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - shift_amount: -4 (left shift by 4)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence. Determine its starting index and the sequence of digits that form the block.
3.  If no non-zero block is found, return the input sequence as is (or a sequence of all zeros, based on desired handling of edge cases - though not present in examples).
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 4 from its original starting index.
5.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
6.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
7.  Return the newly constructed output sequence.
