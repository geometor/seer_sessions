"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or 1D NumPy array of 12 integers) by
identifying the first contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it
4 positions to the left. The sequence length remains 12, padded with zeros.
Elements shifted outside the left boundary (index < 0) are omitted.
If the input contains only zeros, the output is also all zeros.
