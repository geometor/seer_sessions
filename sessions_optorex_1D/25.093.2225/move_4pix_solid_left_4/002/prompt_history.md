Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output:** Both are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
*   **Objects:** The primary objects are the sequences themselves and the contiguous blocks of non-zero integers within them. The zeros act as a background or padding.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Sequences have a fixed length of 12.
    *   Blocks consist of one or more identical non-zero digits.
    *   Blocks have a starting position (index) and a length.
*   **Action:** The core action is shifting the position of the non-zero block within the sequence.
*   **Relationship:** The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by repositioning the non-zero block. The block itself (the digits and their order) remains unchanged. The shift amount appears constant across examples.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits within a sequence of fixed length."
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - contains: primarily zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers
      - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence
      - content: remains unchanged during transformation
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    input: input sequence
    output: the non-zero block and its start index
  - name: calculate_new_position
    input: original start index
    output: new start index (original start index - 4)
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - block
      - new start index
      - sequence length (12)
    output: output sequence (block placed at new position, padded with zeros)
relationships:
  - The output sequence contains the same non-zero block as the input sequence.
  - The start position of the block in the output sequence is consistently 4 positions to the left of its start position in the input sequence.
constants:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - shift_amount: -4 (left shift by 4)
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero integers within the input sequence. Determine its starting index and the sequence of digits that form the block.
3.  If no non-zero block is found, return the input sequence as is (or a sequence of all zeros, based on desired handling of edge cases - though not present in examples).
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by subtracting 4 from its original starting index.
5.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
6.  Place the identified block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index.
7.  Return the newly constructed output sequence.
```python
"""
Identifies a contiguous block of non-zero integers in the input sequence
and shifts it 4 positions to the left to create the output sequence.
The sequence length is fixed at 12. Zeros act as padding.
If the shift would place elements outside the sequence boundaries (index < 0),
those elements are omitted.
