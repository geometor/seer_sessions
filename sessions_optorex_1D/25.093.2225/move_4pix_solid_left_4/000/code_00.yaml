task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of non-zero digits within a sequence of fixed length."
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of integers
      - length: 12
      - contains: primarily zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers
      - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence
      - content: remains unchanged during transformation
actions:
  - name: identify_block
    input: input sequence
    output: the non-zero block and its start index
  - name: calculate_new_position
    input: original start index
    output: new start index (original start index - 4)
  - name: construct_output
    input:
      - block
      - new start index
      - sequence length (12)
    output: output sequence (block placed at new position, padded with zeros)
relationships:
  - The output sequence contains the same non-zero block as the input sequence.
  - The start position of the block in the output sequence is consistently 4 positions to the left of its start position in the input sequence.
constants:
  - sequence_length: 12
  - shift_amount: -4 (left shift by 4)
