The zeros act as a background or padding.\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   Sequences have a fixed length of 12.\n    *   Blocks consist of one or more identical non-zero digits.\n    *   Blocks have a starting position (index) and a length.\n*   **Action:** The core action is shifting the position of the non-zero block within the sequence.\n*   **Relationship:** The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by repositioning the non-zero block. The block itself (the digits and their order) remains unchanged. The shift amount appears constant across examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
