Task: Shift a block of identical non-zero digits 4 positions to the left within a fixed-length sequence.

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.
  Content: Contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (X), surrounded by zeros ('0').
  Structure: '0 ... 0 X X ... X 0 ... 0'

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.
  Content: The non-zero block from the input, shifted left by 4 positions, padded with zeros.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Type: List of 12 integers (derived from input/output string)
      - Length: 12 (fixed)
      - Elements: Integers 0-9
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Element: A single non-zero digit (e.g., 3, 5, 6, 7, 9)
      - Length: The number of times the digit repeats contiguously (variable, >= 1)
      - StartIndex: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.

Relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - The NonZeroBlock's Element and Length are identical in the input and output.
  - The StartIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the output is determined by the input StartIndex.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft4
  - Target: NonZeroBlock
  - Input Property: StartIndex (Input)
  - Output Property Calculation:
      `OutputStartIndex = max(0, InputStartIndex - 4)`
  - Description: Calculate the target start index for the NonZeroBlock in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from its start index in the input sequence. If the result is negative, use 0.
  - SideEffect: Positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted NonZeroBlock are set to 0.

Transformation Process:
  1. Parse the input string into a list of 12 integers.
  2. Locate the NonZeroBlock, identifying its Element, Length, and StartIndex.
  3. Create a new list of 12 zeros.
  4. Calculate the OutputStartIndex using the ShiftLeft4 action rule.
  5. Place the NonZeroBlock (Element repeated Length times) into the new list, starting at OutputStartIndex.
  6. Format the new list back into a space-separated string.
