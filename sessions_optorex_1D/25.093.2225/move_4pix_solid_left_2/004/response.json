            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting a contiguous block of non-zero digits 4 positions to the left within a 12-element sequence. The Python code provided (`code_00.py`) implements this logic. However, it failed execution on all examples with a `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`.\n\nThis error strongly indicates an input type mismatch. The `code_00.py` `transform` function expects a `list[int]` or `np.ndarray`, but the execution environment likely passed the raw input string (e.g., `\"0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\"`). The `np.array()` call on this string, or iteration within the helper function, likely resulted in attempting `int()` on an inappropriate object (like a multi-element array or the full string itself), causing the TypeError.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Revise the code structure to explicitly handle the string input format as described in the task examples. This involves parsing the input string into a list of integers at the beginning of the `transform` function.\n2.  Retain the core logic: finding the non-zero block (digit, length, start index), calculating the new start index (original start index - 4, with a floor of 0), and constructing the output list/array.\n3.  Ensure the output is formatted back into a space-separated string as shown in the examples.\n4.  Re-verify the logic against all examples based on the metrics gathered below.\n\n**Metrics Analysis**\n\nBased on the 7 training examples:\n\n| Example | Input Start Index | Block Digit | Block Length | Output Start Index | Shift Amount |\n| :------ | :---------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----------------- | :----------- |\n| train_1 | 8                 | 5           | 3            | 4                  | -4           |\n| train_2 | 4                 | 9           | 4            | 0                  | -4           |\n| train_3 | 9                 | 7           | 3            | 5                  | -4           |\n| train_4 | 7                 | 3           | 2            | 3                  | -4           |\n| train_5 | 11                | 6           | 1            | 7                  | -4           |\n| train_6 | 5                 | 7           | 6            | 1                  | -4           |\n| train_7 | 4                 | 5           | 7            | 0                  | -4           |\n\n**Key Findings from Metrics:**\n*   **Sequence Length:** Always 12.\n*   **Input Format:** String of space-separated digits.\n*   **Block Consistency:** Always one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.\n*   **Shift Amount:** Consistently -4 (left shift by 4 positions).\n*   **Block Preservation:** The digit and length of the non-zero block are preserved in the output.\n*   **Boundary Condition:** The leftmost position is index 0. If `start_index - 4` is less than 0, the output block starts at index 0.\n*   **Padding:** All positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with 0.\n*   **Output Format:** String of space-separated digits.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
