Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a fixed-length sequence of integers.

Input:
  Type: List or Array of Integers (e.g., numpy.ndarray)
  Length: 12
  Content: Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, padded with zeros.
  Example_Structure: `[0, ..., 0, X, X, ..., X, 0, ..., 0]` where X is a non-zero digit.

Output:
  Type: List or Array of Integers (matching input type)
  Length: 12
  Content: The non-zero block from the input, shifted to a new position, padded with zeros.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Type: List or Array of Integers
      - Length: 12
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Type: Sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers
      - Digit: The non-zero integer composing the block (e.g., 5, 9, 7)
      - Length: Number of times the integer repeats (variable)
      - StartIndex: The starting index of the block within the input sequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft
  - Target: NonZeroBlock
  - Parameter: ShiftAmount = 4 positions
  - Description: The start index of the NonZeroBlock in the output sequence is exactly 4 less than its StartIndex in the input sequence. Positions outside the shifted block are filled with 0.

Relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - The NonZeroBlock's Digit and Length are preserved from input to output.
  - The position of the NonZeroBlock changes predictably (StartIndex_Output = StartIndex_Input - 4).
  - Zeros fill the positions not occupied by the shifted NonZeroBlock in the output sequence.
