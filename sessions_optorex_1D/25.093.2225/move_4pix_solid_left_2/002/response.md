**General Assessment:**

The core issue identified by the execution results is a type mismatch for the input data. The previous `transform` function expected a space-separated string based on the initial examples' representation, but the execution environment provided a NumPy array. Consequently, the string-specific method `.split()` failed. The underlying logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it left by 4 positions appears consistent across all training examples.

The strategy for resolution involves:
1.  Modifying the input handling to accept a list or array of integers directly, eliminating the string parsing step (`_parse_input`).
2.  Adjusting the output generation to return a list or array of integers, removing the string formatting step (`_format_output`).
3.  Ensuring the core logic (`_find_non_zero_block` and the shifting mechanism within `transform`) remains intact, as it correctly reflects the observed transformation in the examples.

**Metrics:**

Based on manual inspection of the provided examples (since code execution failed before analysis):

*Observations from Metrics:*
*   Input/Output Length: Consistently 12 elements.
*   NonZeroBlock: Always a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
*   Transformation: The block's digit and length are preserved. The block is consistently shifted 4 positions to the left. Zeros fill the remaining positions.
*   Input Type (Inferred from Error): Likely a list or array of integers (e.g., `numpy.ndarray`).
*   Output Type (Inferred): Likely expected to be the same type as the input (list or array of integers).

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a fixed-length sequence of integers.

Input:
  Type: List or Array of Integers (e.g., numpy.ndarray)
  Length: 12
  Content: Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, padded with zeros.
  Example_Structure: `[0, ..., 0, X, X, ..., X, 0, ..., 0]` where X is a non-zero digit.

Output:
  Type: List or Array of Integers (matching input type)
  Length: 12
  Content: The non-zero block from the input, shifted to a new position, padded with zeros.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Type: List or Array of Integers
      - Length: 12
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Type: Sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers
      - Digit: The non-zero integer composing the block (e.g., 5, 9, 7)
      - Length: Number of times the integer repeats (variable)
      - StartIndex: The starting index of the block within the input sequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft
  - Target: NonZeroBlock
  - Parameter: ShiftAmount = 4 positions
  - Description: The start index of the NonZeroBlock in the output sequence is exactly 4 less than its StartIndex in the input sequence. Positions outside the shifted block are filled with 0.

Relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - The NonZeroBlock's Digit and Length are preserved from input to output.
  - The position of the NonZeroBlock changes predictably (StartIndex_Output = StartIndex_Input - 4).
  - Zeros fill the positions not occupied by the shifted NonZeroBlock in the output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence as a list or array of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence. Record the non-zero integer itself (the `Digit`), the length of the block (the `Length`), and its starting index (`StartIndex`).
3.  Create a new output sequence (list or array) of 12 integers, initializing all elements to zero.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the non-zero block in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from the `StartIndex` found in the input sequence.
5.  Place the identified non-zero block (using the recorded `Digit` and `Length`) into the output sequence, starting at the calculated target index. Ensure indices stay within the bounds of the 12-element sequence.
6.  Return the newly created output sequence.
