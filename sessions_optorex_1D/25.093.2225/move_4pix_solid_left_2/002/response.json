            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe core issue identified by the execution results is a type mismatch for the input data. The previous `transform` function expected a space-separated string based on the initial examples' representation, but the execution environment provided a NumPy array. Consequently, the string-specific method `.split()` failed. The underlying logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it left by 4 positions appears consistent across all training examples.\n\nThe strategy for resolution involves:\n1.  Modifying the input handling to accept a list or array of integers directly, eliminating the string parsing step (`_parse_input`).\n2.  Adjusting the output generation to return a list or array of integers, removing the string formatting step (`_format_output`).\n3.  Ensuring the core logic (`_find_non_zero_block` and the shifting mechanism within `transform`) remains intact, as it correctly reflects the observed transformation in the examples.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on manual inspection of the provided examples (since code execution failed before analysis):\n\n| Example | Input Sequence                                | NonZeroBlock Digit | NonZeroBlock Length | NonZeroBlock Start Index (Input) | NonZeroBlock Start Index (Output) | Shift Amount |\n| :------ | :-------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------- |\n| train_1 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0]`                   | 5                  | 3                   | 8                                | 4                                 | -4           |\n| train_2 | `[0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9,0,0,0,0]`                   | 9                  | 4                   | 4                                | 0                                 | -4           |\n| train_3 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7]`                   | 7                  | 3                   | 9                                | 5                                 | -4           |\n| train_4 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0]`                   | 3                  | 2                   | 7                                | 3                                 | -4           |\n| train_5 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6]`                   | 6                  | 1                   | 11                               | 7                                 | -4           |\n| train_6 | `[0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,0]`                   | 7                  | 6                   | 5                                | 1                                 | -4           |\n| train_7 | `[0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0]`                   | 5                  | 7                   | 4                                | 0                                 | -4           |\n\n*Observations from Metrics:*\n*   Input/Output Length: Consistently 12 elements.\n*   NonZeroBlock: Always a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.\n*   Transformation: The block's digit and length are preserved.
