**Perception of Elements:**

The task involves manipulating sequences of digits. Each input and output is a string of 12 digits separated by spaces. The core element within each sequence is a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The transformation rule consistently alters the position of this non-zero block within the sequence, while keeping the block's content (the specific digit and its repetition count) and the overall sequence length unchanged. The surrounding elements are always zeros.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Shift a block of non-zero digits within a fixed-length sequence.

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.
  Content: Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, padded with zeros.
  Example_Structure: '0 ... 0 X X ... X 0 ... 0' where X is a non-zero digit.

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.
  Content: The non-zero block from the input, shifted to a new position, padded with zeros.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Type: List of integers (derived from input/output string)
      - Length: 12
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Type: Sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers
      - Digit: The non-zero digit composing the block (e.g., 5, 9, 7)
      - Length: Number of times the digit repeats (variable)
      - Position: Start and end indices within the sequence.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft
  - Target: NonZeroBlock
  - Parameter: ShiftAmount = 4 positions
  - Description: The start index of the NonZeroBlock in the output sequence is 4 less than its start index in the input sequence.

Relationships:
  - The output sequence is a transformation of the input sequence.
  - The NonZeroBlock's digit and length are preserved from input to output.
  - The position of the NonZeroBlock changes predictably (shifted left by 4).
  - Zeros fill the positions not occupied by the shifted NonZeroBlock.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Read the input string and convert it into a list of 12 integers.
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the list. Record the non-zero digit itself, the length of the block, and its starting index in the input list.
3.  Create a new list of 12 integers, initializing all elements to zero.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the non-zero block in the new list by subtracting 4 from its starting index in the original input list.
5.  Place the identified non-zero block (using the recorded digit and length) into the new list, starting at the calculated target index.
6.  Convert the new list of integers back into a space-separated string to produce the output.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting a contiguous block of non-zero digits 4 positions to the left within a 12-element sequence. The Python code provided (`code_00.py`) implements this logic. However, it failed execution on all examples with a `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`.

This error strongly indicates an input type mismatch. The `code_00.py` `transform` function expects a `list[int]` or `np.ndarray`, but the execution environment likely passed the raw input string (e.g., `"0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0"`). The `np.array()` call on this string, or iteration within the helper function, likely resulted in attempting `int()` on an inappropriate object (like a multi-element array or the full string itself), causing the TypeError.

The strategy is to:
1.  Revise the code structure to explicitly handle the string input format as described in the task examples. This involves parsing the input string into a list of integers at the beginning of the `transform` function.
2.  Retain the core logic: finding the non-zero block (digit, length, start index), calculating the new start index (original start index - 4, with a floor of 0), and constructing the output list/array.
3.  Ensure the output is formatted back into a space-separated string as shown in the examples.
4.  Re-verify the logic against all examples based on the metrics gathered below.

**Key Findings from Metrics:**
*   **Sequence Length:** Always 12.
*   **Input Format:** String of space-separated digits.
*   **Block Consistency:** Always one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
*   **Shift Amount:** Consistently -4 (left shift by 4 positions).
*   **Block Preservation:** The digit and length of the non-zero block are preserved in the output.
*   **Boundary Condition:** The leftmost position is index 0. If `start_index - 4` is less than 0, the output block starts at index 0.
*   **Padding:** All positions not occupied by the shifted block are filled with 0.
*   **Output Format:** String of space-separated digits.

**Facts**


```yaml
Task: Shift a block of identical non-zero digits 4 positions to the left within a fixed-length sequence.

Input:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.
  Content: Contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (X), surrounded by zeros ('0').
  Structure: '0 ... 0 X X ... X 0 ... 0'

Output:
  Type: String
  Format: Space-separated sequence of 12 digits.
  Content: The non-zero block from the input, shifted left by 4 positions, padded with zeros.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Type: List of 12 integers (derived from input/output string)
      - Length: 12 (fixed)
      - Elements: Integers 0-9
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Element: A single non-zero digit (e.g., 3, 5, 6, 7, 9)
      - Length: The number of times the digit repeats contiguously (variable, >= 1)
      - StartIndex: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input sequence.

Relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
  - The NonZeroBlock's Element and Length are identical in the input and output.
  - The StartIndex of the NonZeroBlock in the output is determined by the input StartIndex.

Action:
  - Name: ShiftLeft4
  - Target: NonZeroBlock
  - Input Property: StartIndex (Input)
  - Output Property Calculation:
      `OutputStartIndex = max(0, InputStartIndex - 4)`
  - Description: Calculate the target start index for the NonZeroBlock in the output sequence by subtracting 4 from its start index in the input sequence. If the result is negative, use 0.
  - SideEffect: Positions in the output sequence not occupied by the shifted NonZeroBlock are set to 0.

Transformation Process:
  1. Parse the input string into a list of 12 integers.
  2. Locate the NonZeroBlock, identifying its Element, Length, and StartIndex.
  3. Create a new list of 12 zeros.
  4. Calculate the OutputStartIndex using the ShiftLeft4 action rule.
  5. Place the NonZeroBlock (Element repeated Length times) into the new list, starting at OutputStartIndex.
  6. Format the new list back into a space-separated string.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the input, which is a single string containing 12 digits separated by spaces. Convert this string into a list of 12 integers.
2.  **Find Block:** Iterate through the list to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the start of the non-zero block. Record its value (the `block_digit`), its starting index (`start_index`), and count how many times it repeats consecutively (the `block_length`).
3.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new list of 12 integers, initially all set to 0.
4.  **Calculate Target Position:** Determine the target starting index for the block in the new list by calculating `target_start_index = start_index - 4`. If this value is less than 0, set `target_start_index` to 0.
5.  **Place Block:** Fill the elements in the new list from `target_start_index` up to (`target_start_index + block_length - 1`) with the `block_digit`. Ensure writing does not go beyond the list's boundary (index 11).
6.  **Format Output:** Convert the new list of 12 integers back into a single string, with elements separated by spaces. This string is the final output.
