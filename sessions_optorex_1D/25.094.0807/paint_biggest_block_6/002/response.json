The transformation function was designed to operate on space-separated strings, while the actual task environment provides NumPy arrays. The core logic of identifying the longest, leftmost, contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits and replacing its elements with `1` appears consistent with the examples when applied conceptually to arrays. The strategy is to refactor the code to accept a NumPy array as input and return a NumPy array as output, removing the string parsing and joining steps.\n\n*   **Metrics and Evidence:**\n    *   **Input Type:** The error message explicitly states the input object is `numpy.ndarray`.\n    *   **Output Type:** By implication, the expected output is also likely `numpy.ndarray`, as transformation tasks usually maintain the data structure type unless specified otherwise.\n    *   **Core Logic Validation:** A manual check of each `train` example confirms that the rule \"find the longest contiguous run of identical non-zero digits, choose the leftmost if tied, and replace those digits with 1\" correctly transforms the input array to the output array.\n        *   Example 1: Longest run is `4 4 4 4 4` (length 5) at index 1. Replaced -> `1 1 1 1 1`.\n        *   Example 2: Longest run is `3 3 3 3 3` (length 5) at index 5. Replaced -> `1 1 1 1 1`.\n        *   Example 3: Longest run is `2 2 2 2` (length 4) at index 5. Replaced -> `1 1 1 1`.\n        *   Example 4: Longest run is `6 6 6 6 6` (length 5) at index 0. Replaced -> `1 1 1 1 1`.\n        *   Example 5: Longest run is `4 4 4 4 4` (length 5) at index 5. Replaced -> `1 1 1 1 1`.\n        *   Example 6: Longest run is `3 3 3 3 3 3` (length 6) at index 1. Replaced -> `1 1 1 1 1 1`.\n        *   Example 7: Longest run is `3 3 3 3` (length 4) at index 0. Replaced -> `1 1 1 1`.\n    *   **Data Type:** The elements within the arrays are integers.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
