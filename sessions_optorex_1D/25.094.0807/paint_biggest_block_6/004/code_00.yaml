objects:
  - name: sequence_string
    type: string
    description: The input and output data structures, consisting of space-separated digits.
  - name: sequence_list
    type: list_of_integers
    description: An intermediate representation of the sequence obtained by parsing the input string.
  - name: subsequence_run
    type: structure
    description: Represents a contiguous run of identical non-zero digits within the sequence_list.
    contains:
      - name: start_index
        type: integer
        description: The 0-based index where the run begins in the sequence_list.
      - name: length
        type: integer
        description: The number of digits in the run.
      - name: value
        type: integer
        description: The repeating non-zero digit in the run.
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    description: Individual elements within the sequence_list (0-9).

actions:
  - name: parse_string_to_list
    description: Convert the input space-separated digit string into a list of integers.
  - name: find_homogeneous_nonzero_runs
    description: Iterate through the list of integers to identify all contiguous runs of identical non-zero digits.
  - name: select_target_run
    description: >
      From the identified runs, find the one(s) with the maximum length.
      If there's a tie in length, select the run with the smallest start_index (leftmost).
      If no non-zero runs are found, no target run is selected.
  - name: replace_run_digits
    description: >
      Modify a copy of the sequence_list by replacing the digits within the
      selected target_run with the digit 1.
  - name: format_list_to_string
    description: Convert the modified list of integers back into a space-separated digit string.
