            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe core logic identified previously \u2013 finding the longest contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero digits, prioritizing the leftmost one in case of ties, and replacing its digits with '1' \u2013 appears correct based on all training examples.\n\nThe errors reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") indicate an implementation issue, not a logic flaw. The previous code assumed the input `input_grid` was a NumPy array and attempted boolean operations (like `if arr[i] == 0:`) which work element-wise but cause ambiguity when applied implicitly to the whole array in a conditional context.\n\nThe actual input format, as seen in the examples, is a string of space-separated digits, and the output is expected in the same format. The strategy is to reimplement the logic using standard Python list operations after parsing the input string and formatting the resulting list back into a string before returning.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nThe input and output are consistently space-separated strings of digits. The length of the sequence remains unchanged after transformation. The transformation targets only contiguous runs of *identical* digits that are *not zero*.\n\nLet's verify the \"longest, leftmost\" rule against each example:\n\n*   **train_1:** Input: `0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0`. Runs: `(4, length=5, start=1)`, `(4, length=2, start=8)`. Longest is `(4, length=5, start=1)`. Output replaces this run with `1`s. Correct.\n*   **train_2:** Input: `0 0 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0`. Runs: `(3, length=2, start=2)`, `(3, length=5, start=5)`. Longest is `(3, length=5, start=5)`. Output replaces this run with `1`s. Correct.\n*   **train_3:** Input: `2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0`. Runs: `(2, length=3, start=0)`, `(2, length=4, start=5)`. Longest is `(2, length=4, start=5)`. Output replaces this run with `1`s. Correct.\n*   **train_4:** Input: `6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 0`. Runs: `(6, length=5, start=0)`, `(6, length=4, start=7)`. Longest is `(6, length=5, start=0)`. Output replaces this run with `1`s. Correct.\n*   **train_5:** Input: `4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0`. Runs: `(4, length=3, start=0)`, `(4, length=5, start=5)`. Longest is `(4, length=5, start=5)`. Output replaces this run with `1`s. Correct.\n*   **train_6:** Input: `0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 0 0`. Runs: `(3, length=6, start=1)`, `(3, length=2, start=8)`. Longest is `(3, length=6, start=1)`. Output replaces this run with `1`s. Correct.\n*   **train_7:** Input: `3 3 3 3 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0`. Runs: `(3, length=4, start=0)`, `(3, length=2, start=5)`. Longest is `(3, length=4, start=0)`. Output replaces this run with `1`s. Correct.\n\nThe analysis confirms the \"longest, leftmost, non-zero homogeneous run\" rule is consistent across all examples. The implementation needs correction to handle string input/output and list processing.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
