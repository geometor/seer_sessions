            "text": "*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**\n    The provided code failed because it was designed to operate on space-separated string inputs, while the execution environment passed 1D NumPy arrays directly to the `transform` function. The consistent error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` confirms this type mismatch. The core logic of identifying the longest, leftmost, homogeneous run of non-zero digits and replacing it with ones seems consistent with the examples, but the implementation needs to be adapted to handle NumPy arrays as input and output.\n\n    The strategy is to rewrite the `transform` function and its helper(s) to directly accept and manipulate NumPy arrays. String parsing and joining operations will be removed. NumPy's array operations and indexing should be used for efficiency.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The primary metric revealed by the errors is the input data type.\n    *   **Input Type:** `numpy.ndarray` (1D array of integers)\n    *   **Output Type (Expected):** `numpy.ndarray` (1D array of integers)\n    *   **Error Consistency:** The same `AttributeError` occurred for all 7 training examples, indicating the input type mismatch is universal for this task.\n    *   **Core Logic Validity:** The transformation logic described (longest, leftmost, non-zero run -> 1s) appears visually consistent with the input/output pairs provided, despite the code execution failure. For instance:\n        *   `train_1`: `4 4 4 4 4` (len 5) starting at index 1 is the longest non-zero run. Output replaces it with `1 1 1 1 1`.\n        *   `train_2`: `3 3 3 3 3` (len 5) starting at index 5 is the longest non-zero run. Output replaces it with `1 1 1 1 1`.\n        *   `train_4`: `6 6 6 6 6` (len 5) starting at index 0 is the longest non-zero run. Output replaces it with `1 1 1 1 1`.\n        *   `train_7`: `3 3 3 3` (len 4) starting at index 0 is the longest non-zero run (the `3 3` run at index 5 is shorter). Output replaces it with `1 1 1 1`.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
