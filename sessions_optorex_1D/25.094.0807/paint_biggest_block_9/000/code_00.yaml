Task: Modify a sequence of digits based on runs of identical non-zero digits.

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: The sequence of single-digit integers provided as input.
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: The sequence of single-digit integers produced as output.
  - SubsequenceRun:
      type: Conceptual
      description: A contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a sequence.
      properties:
        - value: int (the repeated digit, must be non-zero)
        - length: int (number of repetitions)
        - start_index: int
        - end_index: int
  - ZeroDigit:
      type: int
      value: 0
      description: Acts as a boundary or separator, never modified.
  - OneDigit:
      type: int
      value: 1
      description: The replacement digit used in the output for the selected subsequence.

Actions:
  - IdentifyRuns:
      description: Scan the InputSequence to find all SubsequenceRuns.
      inputs: InputSequence
      outputs: List[SubsequenceRun]
  - FindLongestRun:
      description: Determine the maximum length among all identified SubsequenceRuns.
      inputs: List[SubsequenceRun]
      outputs: max_length (int)
  - SelectTargetRun:
      description: Choose the first SubsequenceRun (by start_index) that matches the max_length.
      inputs:
        - List[SubsequenceRun]
        - max_length
      outputs: target_run (SubsequenceRun)
  - ReplaceRun:
      description: Modify a copy of the InputSequence by replacing the digits of the target_run with OneDigit.
      inputs:
        - InputSequence (or its copy)
        - target_run
        - OneDigit
      outputs: OutputSequence

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence has the same length as InputSequence.
  - ZeroDigits remain unchanged in position and value from InputSequence to OutputSequence.
  - Digits not part of the target_run remain unchanged in position and value.
  - The target_run is the first occurring run with the overall maximum length among all non-zero identical digit runs.
  - The digits within the target_run in the InputSequence are all replaced by OneDigit in the OutputSequence.
