It is never modified during the transformation.\n3.  **Key Digit '1':** The digit `1` appears only in the output sequences and seems to replace other digits.\n4.  **Transformation Focus:** The transformation modifies contiguous subsequences (runs) of identical *non-zero* digits.\n5.  **Modification Rule:** A specific run of identical non-zero digits in the input is replaced by a run of `1`s of the same length in the output.\n6.  **Selection Criteria:**\n    *   The transformation targets the *longest* contiguous run of identical non-zero digits in the *entire* input sequence.\n    *   If there are multiple runs of the same maximum length, the *first* such run encountered (reading from left to right) is the one selected for modification.\n7.  **Conservation:** Digits not part of the selected run (including `0`s and other runs) remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
