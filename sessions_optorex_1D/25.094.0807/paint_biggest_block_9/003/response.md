"""
Transforms a sequence of digits by identifying the longest contiguous run of identical 
non-zero digits. If multiple runs share the maximum length, the first occurring run 
(from left to right) is chosen. The digits within this chosen run are then replaced 
by the digit '1', while all other digits (including zeros and digits in other runs) 
remain unchanged. Assumes input is a list-like sequence of integers.
