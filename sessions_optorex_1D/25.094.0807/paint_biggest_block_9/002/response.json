Use a.any() or a.all()` strongly indicates an issue with how the input data is being handled, likely a type mismatch. The `transform` function is type-hinted to accept `List[int]`, but the error suggests it might be receiving a NumPy array or a similar structure during testing. Conditional statements or operations within the Python code might be implicitly trying to evaluate the truthiness of the entire input array at once, which is ambiguous for multi-element arrays.\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (find the first, longest run of identical non-zero digits and replace it with 1s) appears consistent across all provided training examples based on manual inspection and programmatic verification of the run identification logic.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Logic:** Re-verify the run-finding and selection logic against all examples using the `tool_code` to ensure the underlying algorithm is sound.\n2.  **Isolate Error Source:** Assume the error stems from the input type handling within the testing environment or potentially implicit boolean checks within the provided `transform` function code when interacting with an array-like input. The provided code itself doesn't seem to have explicit boolean checks *on the whole input array* that would cause this specific error if the input was a standard Python list.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML and Natural Language program to be robust, clearly stating the assumed input type (list) and the core logic, which remains valid.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\nUsing `tool_code` to execute the `find_runs` logic and determine the target run for each training example:\n"
