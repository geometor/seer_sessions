Task: Modify a sequence of digits by replacing the first occurring longest contiguous run of identical non-zero digits with 1s.

Input_Type_Assumption: Python List[int] (Note: Execution errors suggest the actual input might be array-like, requiring potential type conversion or adaptation in the coder phase).

Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int] # Assumed type
      description: The sequence of single-digit integers provided as input.
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: The sequence of single-digit integers produced as output. Result of modifying a copy of InputSequence.
  - SubsequenceRun:
      type: Conceptual
      description: A contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within InputSequence.
      properties:
        - value: int (the repeated digit, must be > 0)
        - length: int (number of repetitions)
        - start_index: int (0-based index of the first digit in the run)
        - end_index: int (0-based index of the last digit in the run)
  - ZeroDigit:
      type: int
      value: 0
      description: Acts as a boundary separator; its value and position are preserved.
  - OneDigit:
      type: int
      value: 1
      description: The replacement digit used in OutputSequence for the selected SubsequenceRun.

Actions:
  - IdentifyRuns:
      description: Scan the InputSequence left-to-right to find all SubsequenceRuns.
      inputs: InputSequence
      outputs: List[SubsequenceRun]
  - FindMaxRunLength:
      description: Determine the maximum length among all identified SubsequenceRuns. Returns 0 if no non-zero runs exist.
      inputs: List[SubsequenceRun]
      outputs: max_length (int)
  - SelectTargetRun:
      description: Filter the identified runs to keep only those matching max_length. Select the run with the minimum start_index from this filtered list.
      inputs:
        - List[SubsequenceRun]
        - max_length
      outputs: target_run (SubsequenceRun) or None if no runs exist.
  - GenerateOutput:
      description: Create a copy of InputSequence. If a target_run exists, replace the digits in the output copy from target_run.start_index to target_run.end_index (inclusive) with OneDigit.
      inputs:
        - InputSequence
        - target_run (Optional[SubsequenceRun])
        - OneDigit (value 1)
      outputs: OutputSequence

Relationships:
  - OutputSequence has the same length as InputSequence.
  - ZeroDigits are invariant between InputSequence and OutputSequence.
  - Digits not part of the target_run are invariant.
  - The target_run is characterized by having the maximum length among all runs, and in case of ties in length, having the minimum start_index.
