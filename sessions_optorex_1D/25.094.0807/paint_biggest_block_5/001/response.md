"""
Transforms an input sequence of integers by identifying all contiguous subsequences 
composed of identical, non-zero values. Among these subsequences, it finds the one(s) 
with the maximum length. If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, it selects 
the one that appears earliest (leftmost) in the original sequence. The elements of this 
selected subsequence are then replaced with the integer 1 in the output sequence, while 
all other elements remain unchanged.
