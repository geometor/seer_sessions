Identify Candidates: Scan the input sequence from left to right. Find all contiguous subsequences where every element is the same non-zero integer. For each such subsequence found, record its value, its starting index, and its length.\n2.  Check for Candidates: If no such subsequences were found in step 1, the transformation is complete, and the output sequence is identical to the input sequence. Proceed to step 6.\n3.  Find Max Length: Determine the maximum length among all the candidate subsequences identified in step 1.\n4.  Select Target: Filter the candidate subsequences to keep only those that have the maximum length determined in step 3. From this filtered list, select the single subsequence that has the smallest starting index (i.e., the one that appears earliest in the original input sequence). This is the *target* subsequence.\n5.  Transform Sequence: Create the output sequence by starting with a copy of the input sequence. Then, modify this copied sequence by replacing the elements corresponding to the *target* subsequence (identified by its start index and length) with the integer `1`.\n6.  Return Output: Return the resulting sequence (either the modified sequence from step 5 or the original sequence if no candidates were found in step 2).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_all_homogeneous_nonzero_subsequences(sequence: List[int]) -> List[Dict]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function: Finds all contiguous subsequences of identical, non-zero values.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: The input list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a subsequence\n        and contains 'value', 'start_index', and 'length'.
