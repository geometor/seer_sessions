objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray # Changed from List[int] based on error
    description: A 1-dimensional NumPy array of integers provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy.ndarray # Assuming output should match input type convention
    description: The NumPy array of integers resulting from the transformation.
  - name: subsequence
    type: structure
    description: Represents a contiguous part of the input sequence.
    properties:
      - name: value
        type: int
        description: The identical non-zero integer value of the elements.
      - name: start_index
        type: int
        description: The 0-based index where the subsequence begins in the input_sequence.
      - name: length
        type: int
        description: The number of elements in the subsequence.

actions:
  - name: identify_homogeneous_nonzero_subsequences
    description: Scan the input_sequence to find all contiguous subsequences where all elements are identical and non-zero. Record their value, start_index, and length.
    inputs: input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
    outputs: List[subsequence]
  - name: find_target_subsequence
    description: >
      From the identified subsequences, determine the maximum length.
      Filter the list to keep only subsequences matching the maximum length.
      Select the subsequence from the filtered list that has the smallest start_index.
      If no subsequences were identified initially, this action is skipped.
    inputs: List[subsequence]
    outputs: subsequence (the target subsequence) OR None (if no candidates)
  - name: generate_output
    description: >
      Create the output_sequence.
      If no target_subsequence was found, the output_sequence is a copy of the input_sequence.
      Otherwise, create a copy of the input_sequence and replace the elements corresponding to the target_subsequence (using its start_index and length) with the integer 1.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence (numpy.ndarray)
      - target_subsequence (Optional[subsequence])
    outputs: output_sequence (numpy.ndarray)

relationships:
  - The output_sequence has the same length (shape) as the input_sequence.
  - The transformation targets at most one specific subsequence.
  - The target subsequence is selected based on being the longest non-zero homogeneous run, with ties broken by the leftmost position.
  - Elements outside the target subsequence (if one exists) remain unchanged.
  - If no non-zero homogeneous subsequences exist, the output is identical to the input.
