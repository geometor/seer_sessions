objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A sequence of integers serving as the input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The sequence of integers produced after applying the transformation rule. It has the same length as the input_sequence.
  - name: homogeneous_nonzero_subsequence
    type: Structure
    description: Represents a contiguous subsequence within the input_sequence where all elements are identical and greater than zero.
    properties:
      - value: int (> 0) - The common integer value of the elements.
      - start_index: int (>= 0) - The starting position (0-based index) of the subsequence within the input_sequence.
      - length: int (>= 1) - The number of elements in the subsequence.

actions:
  - name: find_candidate_subsequences
    description: Scan the input_sequence and identify all homogeneous_nonzero_subsequences.
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: List[homogeneous_nonzero_subsequence]
  - name: select_target_subsequence
    description: >
      From the list of candidate subsequences, select the target subsequence based on the following criteria:
      1. Find the maximum length among all candidate subsequences.
      2. Identify all subsequences that have this maximum length.
      3. If only one subsequence has the maximum length, select it.
      4. If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest start_index (the leftmost one).
      Returns None if no candidate subsequences were found.
    inputs: List[homogeneous_nonzero_subsequence]
    outputs: Optional[homogeneous_nonzero_subsequence]
  - name: generate_output
    description: >
      Create the output_sequence.
      If a target_subsequence was selected:
        - Copy the input_sequence.
        - Replace the elements in the copied sequence corresponding to the target_subsequence (from its start_index for its length) with the integer 1.
      If no target_subsequence was selected (i.e., no homogeneous_nonzero_subsequences were found):
        - The output_sequence is an identical copy of the input_sequence.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
      - Optional[target_subsequence]
    outputs: output_sequence

relationships:
  - The output_sequence preserves the length of the input_sequence.
  - Elements in the input_sequence that are *not* part of the selected target_subsequence remain unchanged in the output_sequence.
  - If a target_subsequence is identified, its elements in the input_sequence (which are all identical and non-zero) are replaced by the value 1 in the output_sequence.
  - The selection prioritizes length first, then the starting position (earliest wins) in case of a length tie.
