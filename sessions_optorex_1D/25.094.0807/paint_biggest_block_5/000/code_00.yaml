objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The sequence of integers provided as input.
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    description: The sequence of integers resulting from the transformation.
  - name: subsequence
    type: List[int]
    description: A contiguous part of the input sequence.
    properties:
      - homogeneity: All elements are identical.
      - non_zero: The identical element is not zero.
      - length: The number of elements in the subsequence.
      - start_index: The position where the subsequence begins in the input_sequence.
      - value: The identical non-zero integer value of the elements.

actions:
  - name: identify_subsequences
    description: Find all contiguous subsequences in the input_sequence where all elements are identical and non-zero.
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: List[subsequence]
  - name: find_longest_subsequence
    description: Determine the maximum length among the identified subsequences. If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest start_index.
    inputs: List[subsequence]
    outputs: subsequence (the target subsequence)
  - name: replace_subsequence
    description: Create the output_sequence by copying the input_sequence, then replace the elements corresponding to the target subsequence with the integer 1.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
      - target_subsequence
    outputs: output_sequence

relationships:
  - The output_sequence has the same length as the input_sequence.
  - The transformation targets only one specific subsequence within the input_sequence based on length and position.
  - Elements outside the target subsequence remain unchanged between input and output.
