Identify Candidates: Scan the input array from left to right. Find all contiguous subsequences where every element is the same non-zero integer. For each such subsequence found, record its value, its starting index, and its length.\n2.  Check for Candidates: If no such subsequences were found in step 1, the transformation is complete, and the output array is identical to the input array. Proceed to step 7.\n3.  Find Max Length: Determine the maximum length among all the candidate subsequences identified in step 2.\n4.  Select Target: Filter the candidate subsequences to keep only those that have the maximum length found in step 3. From this filtered list, select the single subsequence that has the smallest starting index (i.e., the one that appears earliest in the original input array). This is the *target* subsequence.\n5.  Transform Sequence: Create the output array by starting with a copy of the input array. Modify this copied array by replacing the elements corresponding to the *target* subsequence (using its start index and length) with the integer `1`.\n6.  Return Output: Return the resulting NumPy array (either the modified array from step 5 or the original copy from step 3).\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_all_homogeneous_nonzero_subsequences(sequence: np.ndarray) -> List[Dict]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function: Finds all contiguous subsequences of identical, non-zero values in a NumPy array.\n\n    Args:\n        sequence: The input 1D NumPy array of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a subsequence\n        and contains 'value', 'start_index', and 'length'.
