Data:
  Input:
    Type: Sequence of integers (potentially provided as a 1D NumPy array).
    Structure: Linear sequence.
  Output:
    Type: Sequence of integers (same format as input).
    Structure: Linear sequence, same length as input.

Objects:
  - Name: Number
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (can be 0 or non-zero).
      - Position: Index within the sequence.
  - Name: Group
    Definition: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero numbers.
    Properties:
      - Value: The common integer value of the numbers in the group.
      - Length: The count of numbers in the group.
      - StartIndex: The index of the first number in the group.
      - EndIndex: The index of the last number in the group.

Relationships:
  - Group Comparison: Groups are compared primarily by their Length.
  - Tie-breaking: Groups with the same maximum Length are compared by their StartIndex.

Derived Properties:
  - MaxGroupLength: The maximum Length found among all identified Groups in the input sequence.
  - TargetGroup: The Group with the minimum StartIndex among all Groups whose Length equals MaxGroupLength.

Action:
  - Name: ReplaceWithOne
    Target: Numbers within the TargetGroup.
    Modification: Change the Value of each number within the indices defined by the TargetGroup's StartIndex and EndIndex to 1.
    Scope: Affects only the TargetGroup; all other numbers in the sequence retain their original value.
