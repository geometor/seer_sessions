            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error message `only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars` across all examples strongly suggests that the input data provided to the `transform` function during testing is not a simple 1D structure (like the string representation shown or a flat list) but rather a NumPy array, potentially with two dimensions (e.g., shape `(1, N)`). The previous code's attempt to convert the input directly to a list of integers using `[int(x) for x in input_grid]` failed because when iterating over a 2D NumPy array, `x` represents a row (an array itself), which cannot be converted to a scalar `int`.\n\nThe core logic identified previously (find contiguous non-zero groups, find max length, replace the *first* max-length group with 1s) appears correct when applied to the *flattened* sequence represented by the input/output strings.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  **Robust Input Preprocessing:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle NumPy array inputs by flattening them (`.flat`) before converting elements to Python integers. This ensures the core logic operates on a consistent 1D list representation.\n2.  **Maintain Core Logic:** The group finding (`_find_groups`) and replacement logic remains the same, operating on the preprocessed 1D list.\n3.  **Output Formatting:** Ensure the function returns the result in the same format as the input (NumPy array or list), preserving the data type if the input was NumPy.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe error itself serves as the primary metric, indicating a type mismatch during input processing due to unexpected input dimensions (likely NumPy arrays instead of flat lists or strings). The `tool_code` simulation confirmed that iterating over a 2D array `arr` with `[int(x) for x in arr]` causes the observed `TypeError`, while iterating over `arr.flat` works correctly. All examples failed with the same error, implying the input format issue is consistent.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
