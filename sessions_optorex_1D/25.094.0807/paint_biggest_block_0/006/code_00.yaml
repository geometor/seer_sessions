Data:
  Input:
    Type: Sequence of integers, provided as a NumPy array (potentially N-dimensional, e.g., shape (1, N) or (N, 1)) or Python list.
    Structure: Represents a conceptually linear sequence; requires flattening if multi-dimensional.
  Output:
    Type: Sequence of integers, matching the original input type (NumPy array or list).
    Structure: Linear sequence, having the same total number of elements as the flattened input.

Objects:
  - Name: Number
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (can be 0 or non-zero)
      - Position: Index within the flattened linear sequence derived from the input.
  - Name: Group
    Definition: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero numbers within the flattened sequence.
    Properties:
      - Value: The common integer value of the numbers in the group.
      - Length: The count of numbers in the group.
      - StartIndex: The 0-based index of the first number of the group in the flattened sequence.
      - EndIndex: The 0-based index of the last number of the group in the flattened sequence.

Relationships:
  - Comparison: Groups are compared based on their Length.
  - Ordering: Groups are ordered based on their StartIndex.

Derived Properties:
  - FlattenedInput: A 1D list of Python integers obtained by flattening the input grid/list and converting elements.
  - MaxGroupLength: The maximum Length found among all identified Groups in the FlattenedInput.
  - TargetGroup: The Group with the smallest StartIndex among all Groups whose Length equals MaxGroupLength.

Action:
  - Name: PreprocessInput
    Target: Input grid/list.
    Action: Create the FlattenedInput by iterating through the elements of the potentially multi-dimensional input (e.g., using `.flat` for NumPy arrays) and converting each element to a Python integer. Record the original input type and NumPy dtype/shape if applicable.
  - Name: FindGroups
    Target: FlattenedInput sequence.
    Action: Identify all contiguous Groups of identical non-zero numbers, storing their properties (Value, Length, StartIndex, EndIndex).
  - Name: SelectTargetGroup
    Target: List of identified Groups.
    Action: Determine MaxGroupLength. Find the first Group (minimum StartIndex) matching MaxGroupLength. Handle the case where no non-zero groups exist.
  - Name: ModifySequence
    Target: A copy of FlattenedInput.
    Action: If a TargetGroup was found, replace the values in the copied sequence at indices from TargetGroup.StartIndex to TargetGroup.EndIndex (inclusive) with the integer 1.
  - Name: FormatOutput
    Target: The modified 1D sequence.
    Action: Convert the sequence back to the original input type (e.g., NumPy array with original dtype/shape, or list). Return the result.
