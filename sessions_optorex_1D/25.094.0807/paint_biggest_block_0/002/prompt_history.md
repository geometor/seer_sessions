Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of space-separated integers.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The core transformation involves identifying a specific contiguous sub-sequence (a "group") of identical non-zero numbers within the input sequence and replacing the numbers in that *single* group with the number `1`. All other numbers, including zeros and numbers in other groups, remain unchanged.
3.  **Group Identification Logic:** The group selected for modification is determined by its length and position. Specifically, the task identifies all contiguous groups of identical non-zero numbers, finds the maximum length among these groups, and then selects the *first* such group (reading from left-to-right) that has this maximum length.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Input:
    Type: Sequence of integers
    Structure: Linear array
  Output:
    Type: Sequence of integers
    Structure: Linear array (same length as input)

Objects:
  - Name: Number
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (can be 0 or non-zero)
      - Position: Index in the sequence
  - Name: Group
    Definition: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero numbers.
    Properties:
      - Value: The common integer value of the numbers in the group.
      - Length: The count of numbers in the group.
      - StartIndex: The index of the first number in the group.
      - EndIndex: The index of the last number in the group.

Relationships:
  - Comparison: Groups can be compared based on their length.
  - Ordering: Groups can be ordered based on their StartIndex.

Derived Properties:
  - MaxGroupLength: The maximum length found among all identified Groups in the input sequence.
  - TargetGroup: The first Group (ordered by StartIndex) whose Length equals the MaxGroupLength.

Action:
  - Name: Replace
    Target: Numbers within the TargetGroup
    Modification: Change the Value of each number in the TargetGroup to 1.
    Scope: Only affects the TargetGroup; all other numbers retain their original value.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a sequence (list) of integers.
2.  Identify all contiguous groups of identical non-zero numbers within the sequence. For each group, record its value, length, and starting index.
3.  Determine the maximum length among all identified groups.
4.  Find the first group (the one with the smallest starting index) that has this maximum length. This is the "target group".
5.  Create a copy of the input sequence to serve as the output sequence.
6.  Iterate through the indices corresponding to the target group (from its start index to its end index) in the output sequence.
7.  For each index within the target group, set the value in the output sequence to `1`.
8.  Convert the modified output sequence back into a space-separated string.
