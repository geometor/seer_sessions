All other numbers, including zeros and numbers in other groups, remain unchanged.\n3.  **Group Identification Logic:** The group selected for modification is determined by its length and position. Specifically, the task identifies all contiguous groups of identical non-zero numbers, finds the maximum length among these groups, and then selects the *first* such group (reading from left-to-right) that has this maximum length.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
