Data:
  Input:
    Type: Sequence of integers
    Structure: Linear array
  Output:
    Type: Sequence of integers
    Structure: Linear array (same length as input)

Objects:
  - Name: Number
    Properties:
      - Value: Integer (can be 0 or non-zero)
      - Position: Index in the sequence
  - Name: Group
    Definition: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero numbers.
    Properties:
      - Value: The common integer value of the numbers in the group.
      - Length: The count of numbers in the group.
      - StartIndex: The index of the first number in the group.
      - EndIndex: The index of the last number in the group.

Relationships:
  - Comparison: Groups can be compared based on their length.
  - Ordering: Groups can be ordered based on their StartIndex.

Derived Properties:
  - MaxGroupLength: The maximum length found among all identified Groups in the input sequence.
  - TargetGroup: The first Group (ordered by StartIndex) whose Length equals the MaxGroupLength.

Action:
  - Name: Replace
    Target: Numbers within the TargetGroup
    Modification: Change the Value of each number in the TargetGroup to 1.
    Scope: Only affects the TargetGroup; all other numbers retain their original value.
