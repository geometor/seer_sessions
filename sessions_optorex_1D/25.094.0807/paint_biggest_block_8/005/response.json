Scan the input sequence from left to right to identify all contiguous runs (subsequences) composed of identical non-zero digits. For each run found, record its starting index, its length, and the digit it consists of. Ignore zeros when identifying runs.\n2.  If no non-zero runs are identified, return the original input sequence unchanged.\n3.  If one or more runs were identified, determine the maximum length among all found runs.\n4.  Select the run that has this maximum length. If multiple runs share the maximum length, select the one that occurs earliest in the sequence (i.e., the one with the smallest starting index).\n5.  Create a new sequence by copying the input sequence.\n6.  Modify the new sequence by replacing the digits at the indices corresponding to the selected run (from its starting index up to its starting index plus its length minus one) with the digit '1'.\n7.
