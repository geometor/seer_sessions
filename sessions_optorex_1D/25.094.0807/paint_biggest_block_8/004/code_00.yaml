objects:
  - name: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list_of_integers (1-dimensional)
      - contains: single digits (0-9)
  - name: run
    properties:
      - type: contiguous_subsequence
      - location: within the sequence
      - composition: identical_non_zero_digits
      - attributes:
          - start_index: integer (0-based)
          - length: integer (count of digits in the run)
          - value: integer (the digit comprising the run, 1-9)
relationships:
  - type: identification
    subject: sequence
    object: run
    details: A sequence can contain zero or more runs. Runs are identified by scanning the sequence.
actions:
  - name: find_all_runs
    input: sequence
    output: list_of_runs
    description: Identifies all contiguous subsequences of identical non-zero digits, recording their start index, length, and value.
  - name: select_target_run
    input: list_of_runs
    output: target_run (or null if no runs exist)
    description: >
      Finds the run(s) with the maximum length. If multiple runs share the maximum length,
      selects the one with the smallest start_index (the leftmost one).
  - name: replace_run_with_ones
    input:
      - sequence
      - target_run
    output: modified_sequence
    description: >
      Creates a new sequence by copying the input sequence. Then, replaces the elements
      within the identified target_run (from its start_index for its length) with the digit '1'.
      If no target_run was selected, the original sequence is returned.
