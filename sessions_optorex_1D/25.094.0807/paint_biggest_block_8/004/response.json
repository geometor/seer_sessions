            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed execution on all examples with a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in NumPy when an array is used in a boolean context that expects a single scalar True/False value (e.g., as the condition in an `if` statement).\n\nTracing the code logic against the examples suggests the core algorithm (find all runs of identical non-zero digits, identify the longest, replace the first instance of the longest run with 1s) is correct and matches the input/output transformations.\n\nThe error likely stems from an unexpected input format being passed to the `transform` function during testing. The function expects a 1D list or NumPy array of integers. However, the error suggests that `sequence[i]` inside the `find_runs` function was treated as an array, not a scalar integer. This would happen if the input `sequence` was inadvertently a 2D array (e.g., a list containing a single list `[[...]]`).\n\n**Strategy:**\n1.  Assume the core transformation logic identified previously is correct.\n2.  Modify the Python code (in the Coder phase) to be robust against potential input variations, specifically by ensuring the input array is treated as 1D (e.g., by flattening or selecting the first row if a 1xN array is detected).\n3.  Maintain the previously derived YAML facts and Natural Language Program as they accurately describe the intended transformation on a 1D sequence.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code failed at runtime for all examples, so no output comparison is possible. However, analyzing the inputs and expected outputs confirms the transformation rule:\n\n| Example | Input Length | Non-Zero Runs (Value, Length, Start Index) | Max Run Length | Selected Run (Start Index, Length) | Output Matches Rule? | Code Output | Status |\n| :------ | :----------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------- | :---------- | :----- |\n| train_1 | 12           | (7, 2, 2), (7, 5, 5)                       | 5              | (5, 5)                             | Yes                  | Error       | Fail   |\n| train_2 | 12           | (9, 3, 2), (9, 2, 9)                       | 3              | (2, 3)                             | Yes                  | Error       | Fail   |\n| train_3 | 12           | (8, 3, 2), (8, 6, 6)                       | 6              | (6, 6)                             | Yes                  | Error       | Fail   |\n| train_4 | 12           | (5, 5, 1), (5, 2, 9)                       | 5              | (1, 5)                             | Yes                  | Error       | Fail   |\n| train_5 | 12           | (3, 2, 0), (3, 4, 4)                       | 4              | (4, 4)                             | Yes                  | Error       | Fail   |\n| train_6 | 12           | (6, 5, 0), (6, 2, 6)                       | 5              | (0, 5)                             | Yes                  | Error       | Fail   |\n| train_7 | 12           | (5, 3, 0), (5, 5, 4)                       | 5              | (4, 5)                             | Yes                  | Error       | Fail   |\n| test_1  | ?            | ?                                          | ?              | ?                                  | ?                    | Error       | Fail   |\n\n*Note: The metrics confirm that the intended logic involves finding the longest run (leftmost in case of ties) of identical non-zero digits and replacing it with 1s.*\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
