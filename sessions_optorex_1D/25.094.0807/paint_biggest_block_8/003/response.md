"""
Transforms a sequence of single-digit integers based on the following rule:
1. Identify all contiguous subsequences (runs) of identical non-zero digits.
2. Find the run(s) with the maximum length.
3. If multiple runs share the maximum length, select the leftmost one (smallest starting index).
4. Replace the digits in the selected run with the digit '1'.
5. If no non-zero runs exist, the sequence remains unchanged.
