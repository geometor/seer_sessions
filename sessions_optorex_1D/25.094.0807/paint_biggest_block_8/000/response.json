For example, in `0 0 7 7 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0`, the runs are `7 7` and `7 7 7 7 7`. `0`s are ignored when identifying these runs.\n4.  **Selection Criterion:** Among all identified runs of identical non-zero digits, the *longest* run is selected for modification. If there are multiple runs of the same maximum length, the first one encountered (from left to right) seems to be the one selected based on the examples (though no example explicitly tests this tie-breaker).\n5.  **Modification Rule:** The selected longest run is replaced by a sequence of the digit `1`, with the same length as the original run.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
