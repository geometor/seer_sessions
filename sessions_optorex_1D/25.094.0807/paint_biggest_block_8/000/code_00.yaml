relationships:
  - type: containment
    subject: run
    object: sequence
    details: A sequence can contain zero or more runs.
actions:
  - name: identify_runs
    input: sequence
    output: list_of_runs
    description: Finds all contiguous subsequences of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence.
  - name: find_longest_run
    input: list_of_runs
    output: selected_run (or null if no runs)
    description: >
      Selects the run with the maximum length from the list.
      If multiple runs share the maximum length, selects the one with the smallest start_index.
  - name: replace_run_with_ones
    input:
      - sequence
      - selected_run
    output: modified_sequence
    description: >
      Replaces the digits within the sequence corresponding to the selected_run's start_index and end_index
      with the digit '1'. The length of the replacement is the same as the length of the selected_run.
