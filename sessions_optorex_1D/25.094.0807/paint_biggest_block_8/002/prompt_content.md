"""
Transforms a sequence of integers by performing the following steps:
1. Identifies all contiguous subsequences (runs) consisting of identical non-zero digits.
2. Determines the maximum length among these identified runs.
3. Selects the run with the maximum length. If multiple runs share the maximum length, the one that appears earliest (leftmost) in the sequence is chosen.
4. If no non-zero runs are found, the original sequence is returned unchanged.
5. If a longest run is selected, a new sequence is created where the elements corresponding to the selected run are replaced by the digit '1'. The length of the replacement sequence of '1's is equal to the length of the original selected run.
