objects:
  - name: sequence
    description: A 1-dimensional sequence (list or array) of single-digit integers (0-9).
    properties:
      - type: list_or_array_of_integers
      - element_range: 0-9
  - name: run
    description: A contiguous subsequence within the main sequence composed of identical non-zero digits.
    properties:
      - type: contiguous_subsequence
      - composition: identical_non_zero_digits
      - attributes:
          - start_index: integer (0-based index in the main sequence)
          - length: integer (number of elements in the run, must be >= 1)
          - digit_value: integer (the repeating digit, 1-9)
relationships:
  - type: identification
    subject: sequence
    object: run
    details: A sequence can contain zero or more runs. Runs are identified by scanning the sequence.
actions:
  - name: find_runs
    input: sequence
    output: list_of_runs
    description: Identifies all runs within the input sequence and returns a list of their properties (start_index, length, digit_value).
  - name: select_target_run
    input: list_of_runs
    output: target_run (or null if list_of_runs is empty)
    description: >
      From the list of runs, selects the run with the maximum length.
      If multiple runs share the maximum length, selects the one with the smallest start_index (the leftmost one).
  - name: replace_run_with_ones
    input:
      - sequence
      - target_run
    output: modified_sequence
    description: >
      Creates a new sequence by copying the input sequence. Then, modifies the new sequence
      by replacing the elements corresponding to the target_run (from start_index for length elements)
      with the digit '1'.
