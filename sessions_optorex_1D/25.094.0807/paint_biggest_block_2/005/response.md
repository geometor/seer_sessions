"""
Transforms a sequence of digits according to the following rule:
1.  Parse the input space-separated string into a list of integers.
2.  Identify all contiguous blocks (sub-sequences) composed of identical non-zero digits. Record the start index, end index, and length for each block.
3.  If no non-zero blocks exist, return the original input string.
4.  Find the maximum length among all identified blocks.
5.  Select the "target block": the block with the maximum length. If there's a tie in length, choose the block that appears earliest (leftmost, smallest start index).
6.  Create a copy of the original list of integers.
7.  Modify the copied list by replacing every digit within the index range of the target block (inclusive) with the digit 1.
8.  Format the modified list back into a space-separated string and return it.
