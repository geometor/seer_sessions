*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits. The transformation focuses on modifying a specific contiguous sub-sequence (block) of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. The core operation is replacing the digits within the identified block with the digit '1'. The key challenge lies in identifying the correct block to modify. Zeroes appear to act as delimiters and are never modified. The selection criteria for the block seem related to its length and position. Specifically, the longest contiguous block of identical non-zero digits is targeted. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the first one encountered (leftmost) is chosen.

        description: Assemble the output_sequence by keeping unmodified digits and incorporating the modified target_block.
    relationships:
      - output_sequence is a modified version of input_sequence.
      - modification only applies to the target_block.
      - the target_block is selected based on length and position from all contiguous_blocks.
      - zero_digits separate potential contiguous_blocks and remain unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a sequence of integers.
    2.  Identify all contiguous sub-sequences (blocks) composed of identical non-zero digits. Record the starting index, ending index, and length of each block.
    3.  Find the maximum length among all identified blocks.
    4.  Select the target block: Choose the block that has this maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest starting index (the leftmost one).
    5.  Create a new sequence, initially identical to the input sequence.
    6.  Iterate from the starting index to the ending index of the selected target block in the new sequence, changing each digit within this range to '1'.
    7.  Format the resulting sequence back into a space-separated string of digits for the output.
