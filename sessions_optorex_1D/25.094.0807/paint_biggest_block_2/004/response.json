            "text": "*   **General Assessment:** The provided code implements the logic described in the initial analysis: find the longest contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, favoring the leftmost block in case of ties, and replace its digits with '1'. A manual review of all training examples confirms this logic correctly transforms the input to the expected output in every case. The reported `ValueError` seems unrelated to the core transformation logic within the `transform` function itself, especially its input parsing. The error message (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: '...'`) indicates that the test harness or an external caller might be incorrectly attempting to convert the *entire output string* (e.g., \"1 1 1 1 1 1 0 7 7 0 7 7\") into a single integer, which is not a valid operation. Assuming the task requires the function to return the transformed space-separated string, the internal logic appears sound. The strategy is to refine the documentation (facts and natural language program) to ensure maximum clarity and accuracy based on the confirmed pattern across all examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:** No computational metrics are needed for this analysis. The pattern identification relies on sequence analysis:\n    *   Identifying contiguous runs of identical non-zero digits.\n    *   Calculating the length of each run.\n    *   Finding the maximum length.\n    *   Selecting the run with the maximum length that appears earliest (minimum starting index).\n    *   This pattern holds consistently across all 7 training examples.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
