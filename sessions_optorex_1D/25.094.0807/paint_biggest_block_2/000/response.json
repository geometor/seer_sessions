The transformation focuses on modifying a specific contiguous sub-sequence (block) of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. The core operation is replacing the digits within the identified block with the digit '1'. The key challenge lies in identifying the correct block to modify. Zeroes appear to act as delimiters and are never modified. The selection criteria for the block seem related to its length and position. Specifically, the longest contiguous block of identical non-zero digits is targeted. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the first one encountered (leftmost) is chosen.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
