*   **Perception:** The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits. The transformation focuses on modifying a specific contiguous sub-sequence (block) of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. The core operation is replacing the digits within the identified block with the digit '1'. The key challenge lies in identifying the correct block to modify. Zeroes appear to act as delimiters and are never modified. The selection criteria for the block seem related to its length and position. Specifically, the longest contiguous block of identical non-zero digits is targeted. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the first one encountered (leftmost) is chosen.

    relationships:
      - output_sequence is a modified version of input_sequence.

      - the target_block is selected based on length and position from all contiguous_blocks.
      - zero_digits separate potential contiguous_blocks and remain unchanged.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a sequence of integers.
    2.  Identify all contiguous sub-sequences (blocks) composed of identical non-zero digits. Record the starting index, ending index, and length of each block.
    3.  Find the maximum length among all identified blocks.
    4.  Select the target block: Choose the block that has this maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest starting index (the leftmost one).
    5.  Create a new sequence, initially identical to the input sequence.
    6.  Iterate from the starting index to the ending index of the selected target block in the new sequence, changing each digit within this range to '1'.
    7.  Format the resulting sequence back into a space-separated string of digits for the output.

*   **General Assessment:** The previous code failed across all examples with the identical error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates that the input data type assumption was incorrect. The code expected a space-separated string, but the test environment provided NumPy arrays. The core logic for identifying and modifying the longest, leftmost block of identical non-zero digits appears conceptually sound based on the initial analysis of the examples, but it couldn't be tested due to the input parsing failure.
*   **Strategy:** The primary fix involves modifying the initial step of the transformation process to correctly handle NumPy arrays as input instead of strings. The rest of the natural language program, which describes finding the target block and replacing its elements with '1', likely remains valid. The output format still needs to be a space-separated string.

*   **Metrics:** All 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided resulted in the same `AttributeError` during the input processing phase. No meaningful metrics about the block identification or transformation logic could be gathered from the failed execution, as the error occurred before these steps were reached. The consistent failure mode confirms the input type mismatch.

      - output_sequence is a transformed representation of the input_sequence.
      - modification only applies to the selected target_block's elements.
      - the target_block is selected based on length and position from all contiguous_blocks of identical non-zero digits.
      - zero_digits act as separators for blocks and remain unchanged in the output.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input NumPy array containing a sequence of integers.
    2.  Convert the input NumPy array into a standard Python list of integers.
    3.  Identify all contiguous sub-sequences (blocks) within the list that are composed of identical, non-zero digits. Record the starting index, ending index, and length of each identified block.
    4.  If no non-zero blocks are found, proceed directly to step 8 using the original list.
    5.  Find the maximum length among all identified blocks.
    6.  Select the target block: Choose the block that has this maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest starting index (the leftmost one).
    7.  Create a new list of integers, initially as a copy of the list derived from the input array. Iterate from the starting index to the ending index (inclusive) of the selected target block in this new list, changing each integer within this range to `1`.
    8.  Format the resulting list of integers (either the modified list from step 7 or the original list if no blocks were modified) into a space-separated string of digits for the final output.
