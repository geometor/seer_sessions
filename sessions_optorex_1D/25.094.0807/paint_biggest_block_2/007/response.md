"""
Transforms a sequence of digits according to the following rule:
1.  Receive the input NumPy array containing a sequence of integers.
2.  Convert the input NumPy array into a standard Python list of integers.
3.  Identify all contiguous sub-sequences (blocks) within the list that are composed of identical, non-zero digits. Record the starting index, ending index, and length of each identified block.
4.  If no non-zero blocks are found, proceed directly to step 8 using the original list.
5.  Find the maximum length among all identified blocks.
6.  Select the target block: Choose the block that has this maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, select the one with the smallest starting index (the leftmost one).
7.  Create a new list of integers, initially as a copy of the list derived from the input array. Iterate from the starting index to the ending index (inclusive) of the selected target block in this new list, changing each integer within this range to `1`.
8.  Format the resulting list of integers (either the modified list from step 7 or the original list if no blocks were modified) into a space-separated string of digits for the final output.
