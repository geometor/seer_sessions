            "text": "*   **General Assessment:** The previous code failed across all examples with the identical error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This clearly indicates that the input data type assumption was incorrect. The code expected a space-separated string, but the test environment provided NumPy arrays. The core logic for identifying and modifying the longest, leftmost block of identical non-zero digits appears conceptually sound based on the initial analysis of the examples, but it couldn't be tested due to the input parsing failure.\n*   **Strategy:** The primary fix involves modifying the initial step of the transformation process to correctly handle NumPy arrays as input instead of strings. The rest of the natural language program, which describes finding the target block and replacing its elements with '1', likely remains valid. The output format still needs to be a space-separated string.\n\n*   **Metrics:** All 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided resulted in the same `AttributeError` during the input processing phase. No meaningful metrics about the block identification or transformation logic could be gathered from the failed execution, as the error occurred before these steps were reached. The consistent failure mode confirms the input type mismatch.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "
