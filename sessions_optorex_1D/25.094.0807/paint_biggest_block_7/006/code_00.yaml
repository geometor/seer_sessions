objects:
  - input_sequence: A sequence (typically string) of space-separated single digits.
  - parsed_list: A list of integers derived from the input_sequence.
  - output_list: A list of integers derived from the parsed_list.
  - digit: An integer value (0-9).
  - non_zero_digit: A digit from 1 to 9.
  - run: A consecutive sub-list of identical non_zero_digits within the parsed_list.
properties:
  - frequency: The total count of occurrences of a specific non_zero_digit in the parsed_list.
  - length: The number of digits in a run.
  - start_index: The 0-based index of the first digit in a run.
  - end_index: The 0-based index of the last digit in a run.
  - most_frequent_non_zero_digit: The non_zero_digit with the highest frequency in the parsed_list. (Assumed unique based on examples).
  - longest_run: The run of the most_frequent_non_zero_digit that has the greatest length. (Assumed unique based on examples).
actions:
  - parse_input: Convert the input_sequence string into a parsed_list of integers.
  - identify_non_zero_digits: Filter the parsed_list to consider only non_zero_digits.
  - calculate_frequencies: Count occurrences of each unique non_zero_digit.
  - find_most_frequent: Determine the non_zero_digit with the highest frequency (target_digit).
  - identify_runs: Find all consecutive runs of the target_digit within the parsed_list.
  - find_longest_run: Determine the specific run of the target_digit that has the maximum length, noting its start_index, end_index, and length.
  - create_output_copy: Initialize the output_list as a copy of the parsed_list.
  - replace_digits_in_run: Modify the output_list by changing the digits within the identified longest_run (from start_index to end_index inclusive) to the digit `1`.
relationships:
  - The output_list preserves the length and all elements of the parsed_list, except for the elements within the single identified longest_run of the most_frequent_non_zero_digit.
  - The elements within that specific run are replaced by `1`.
  - Zeroes (`0`) act as separators and are never modified or counted for frequency/runs.
