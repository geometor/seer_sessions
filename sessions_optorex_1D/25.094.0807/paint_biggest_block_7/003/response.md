"""
Transforms an input sequence of digits by:
1. Parsing the input into a list of integers.
2. Identifying the most frequent non-zero digit in the list.
3. Finding the longest consecutive run (sequence) of this most frequent digit.
4. Replacing the digits within this specific longest run with the digit 1.
5. All other digits remain unchanged. Zeros act as separators and are never modified.
If no non-zero digits exist, or the input is empty, the original sequence (or an empty list) is returned.
Assumes unique most frequent non-zero digit and unique longest run for that digit.
