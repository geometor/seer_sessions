objects:
  - input_data: A sequence of digits, typically provided as a space-separated string.
  - input_list: A list of single-digit integers derived by parsing input_data.
  - output_list: A list of single-digit integers derived from the input_list.
  - digit: An integer value between 0 and 9.
  - non_zero_digit: A digit that is not 0.
  - sequence: A consecutive sub-list of identical non_zero_digits within the input_list.
properties:
  - frequency: The count of occurrences of a specific non_zero_digit in the input_list.
  - length: The number of digits in a sequence.
  - position: The starting and ending indices of a sequence within the input_list.
  - most_frequent_non_zero_digit: The non_zero_digit with the highest frequency in the input_list. (Uniqueness assumed).
  - longest_sequence: The sequence of the most_frequent_non_zero_digit that has the greatest length. (Uniqueness assumed).
actions:
  - parse_input: Convert the input_data (e.g., string) into a list of integers (input_list).
  - identify_non_zero_digits: Filter out zeros from the input_list.
  - calculate_frequencies: Count occurrences of each unique non_zero_digit.
  - find_most_frequent: Determine the non_zero_digit with the highest count.
  - identify_sequences: Find all consecutive runs of the most_frequent_non_zero_digit.
  - find_longest_run: Determine which sequence of the most_frequent_non_zero_digit has the maximum length, returning its start and end indices.
  - replace_digits: Modify a copy of the input_list by changing the digits within the identified longest_sequence to `1`.
relationships:
  - The output_list is derived from the input_list by replacing one specific sequence.
  - The sequence to be replaced is determined by frequency and length criteria applied to the non_zero_digits of the input_list.
  - Zeros act as delimiters for sequences and are never modified.
