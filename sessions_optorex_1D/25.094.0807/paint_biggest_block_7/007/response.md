"""
Transforms an input sequence of space-separated single digits by:
1. Parsing the input sequence into a list of integers (`parsed_list`).
2. Identifying the non-zero digit that occurs most frequently in the `parsed_list` (the `target_digit`). Assumes a unique most frequent non-zero digit.
3. Finding the longest consecutive run (sub-sequence) within the `parsed_list` consisting solely of the `target_digit`. Assumes a unique longest run for the target digit.
4. Creating a copy of the `parsed_list`.
5. Replacing the elements within the identified longest run in the copied list with the digit `1`.
6. All other elements (including zeros and digits not part of the replaced run) remain unchanged.
7. Returning the modified list. If the input is empty, invalid, or contains only zeros, the original list (or an empty list) is returned.
