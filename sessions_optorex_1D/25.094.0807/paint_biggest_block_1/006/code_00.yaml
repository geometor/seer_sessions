objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of digits
    properties:
      - ordered
      - contains digits 0-9
      - length (e.g., 12 in examples)
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value (0-9)
      - position (index within sequence)
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
  - name: non_zero_subsequence
    type: maximal contiguous list of non_zero_digits within the main sequence
    properties:
      - start_index: position of the first digit
      - end_index: position of the last digit
      - length: number of digits in the subsequence
      - delimited_by: sequence boundaries or zero_digits

actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_subsequences
    description: Finds all maximal contiguous subsequences composed solely of non-zero digits.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - list of non_zero_subsequences (each with start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: find_target_subsequence
    description: >
      Selects the subsequence with the maximum length from a list of non_zero_subsequences.
      If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, the one with the smallest
      start_index is chosen.
    inputs:
      - list of non_zero_subsequences
    outputs:
      - the target non_zero_subsequence (or null/none if no non-zero subsequences exist)
  - name: replace_digits_with_one
    description: >
      Modifies a copy of the sequence by replacing digits within the range defined
      by the target_subsequence (start_index to end_index, inclusive) with the digit '1'.
    inputs:
      - sequence
      - target_subsequence (containing start_index and end_index)
    outputs:
      - modified sequence

relationships:
  - non_zero_subsequences are separated by zero_digits or sequence boundaries.
  - The transformation targets the non_zero_subsequence with the maximum length property.
  - Tie-breaking for maximum length is resolved by selecting the subsequence with the minimum start_index.
  - If no non_zero_subsequences exist, the sequence remains unchanged.
