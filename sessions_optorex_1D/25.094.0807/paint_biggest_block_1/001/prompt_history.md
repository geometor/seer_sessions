Okay, let's break down the task based on the provided examples.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves processing sequences of single digits. The core operation seems to be identifying a specific contiguous subsequence of non-zero digits within the input sequence and replacing every digit in that subsequence with the digit `1`. The rule for selecting *which* subsequence to modify appears related to the position of `0` digits within the sequence and the length of the non-zero subsequences.

By analyzing the examples, it becomes clear that we need to consider three types of non-zero subsequences:
1.  Those occurring *before* the first `0`.
2.  Those occurring *between* two `0`s.
3.  Those occurring *after* the last `0`.

The transformation targets the *longest* such subsequence found in the input. If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, the provided examples don't explicitly cover tie-breaking, but consistently applying the rule to *the* longest one (implying one unique longest or consistent selection if tied) works for all cases.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of digits
    properties:
      - ordered
      - contains digits 0-9
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value (0-9)
      - position (index within sequence)
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
  - name: subsequence
    type: contiguous list of digits within the main sequence
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
      - content_type (e.g., all non-zero)
      - location_relative_to_zeros (before first, between, after last)

actions:
  - name: identify_subsequences
    description: Find all maximal contiguous subsequences composed solely of non-zero digits.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - list of non_zero_subsequences (including start, end, length)
  - name: find_longest_subsequence
    description: Select the subsequence with the maximum length from a list of subsequences.
    inputs:
      - list of subsequences
    outputs:
      - the longest subsequence (or one of them if tied)
  - name: replace_digits
    description: Modify the sequence by replacing digits within a specific range with the digit '1'.
    inputs:
      - sequence
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - replacement_value (which is '1' in this task)
    outputs:
      - modified sequence

relationships:
  - A subsequence's location is defined relative to the positions of zero_digits or the sequence boundaries.
  - The transformation targets the subsequence with the maximum length property.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of digits.
2.  Identify all maximal contiguous subsequences within the list that consist entirely of non-zero digits. Record the start index, end index, and length for each such subsequence found.
3.  Compare the lengths of all identified non-zero subsequences and determine the maximum length.
4.  Select the subsequence that corresponds to this maximum length. (If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, the specific choice doesn't alter the outcome in the examples, but selecting the first one encountered would be a consistent approach).
5.  Create a new list by copying the original input list.
6.  Iterate through the indices from the start index to the end index (inclusive) of the selected longest subsequence. For each index in this range, set the value in the new list to `1`.
7.  Convert the modified list back into a space-separated string of digits for the final output.
