Identify all maximal contiguous subsequences within the input sequence that consist entirely of non-zero digits (1-9). Record the start index, end index, and length for each.\n2. Find the subsequence with the maximum length among those identified.\n3. If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, select the one that appears earliest in the original sequence (i.e., has the minimum start index).\n4. If no non-zero subsequences exist, return the original sequence unchanged.\n5. Create a copy of the original sequence.\n6. Replace every digit within the selected longest subsequence (from its start index to its end index, inclusive) in the copied sequence with the digit '1'.\n7.
