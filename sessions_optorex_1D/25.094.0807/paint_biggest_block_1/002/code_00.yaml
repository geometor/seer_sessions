objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - ordered
      - contains digits 0-9
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - derived from input_sequence
      - same length as input_sequence
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value (0-9)
      - position (index within sequence)
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
  - name: non_zero_subsequence
    type: contiguous sublist within the input_sequence
    properties:
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer
      - length: integer (end_index - start_index + 1)
      - composed_of: non_zero_digits only
      - maximal: cannot be extended further left or right without including a zero or boundary

actions:
  - name: identify_all_maximal_non_zero_subsequences
    description: Iterate through the input_sequence to find all maximal contiguous subsequences composed solely of non-zero digits.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
    outputs:
      - list of non_zero_subsequences (each with start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: find_the_longest_subsequence
    description: >
      From the list of identified non_zero_subsequences, select the one with the maximum length.
      If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, consistently select the one that appears earliest
      (smallest start_index) in the input_sequence.
    inputs:
      - list of non_zero_subsequences
    outputs:
      - the selected longest non_zero_subsequence (or null/None if no non_zero_subsequences exist)
  - name: generate_output_sequence
    description: >
      Create a copy of the input_sequence. If a longest non_zero_subsequence was found,
      replace the digits within its start_index and end_index (inclusive) in the copied sequence
      with the digit 1. Otherwise, the copied sequence remains unchanged.
    inputs:
      - input_sequence
      - longest_non_zero_subsequence (or null/None)
    outputs:
      - output_sequence

relationships:
  - The output_sequence is identical to the input_sequence except for the elements within the identified longest non_zero_subsequence, which are changed to 1.
  - The selection criterion is based purely on the 'length' property of the non_zero_subsequences.
