objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of digits
    properties:
      - ordered
      - contains digits 0-9
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value (0-9)
      - position (index within sequence)
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
  - name: subsequence
    type: contiguous list of digits within the main sequence
    properties:
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - length
      - content_type (e.g., all non-zero)
      - location_relative_to_zeros (before first, between, after last)

actions:
  - name: identify_subsequences
    description: Find all maximal contiguous subsequences composed solely of non-zero digits.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - list of non_zero_subsequences (including start, end, length)
  - name: find_longest_subsequence
    description: Select the subsequence with the maximum length from a list of subsequences.
    inputs:
      - list of subsequences
    outputs:
      - the longest subsequence (or one of them if tied)
  - name: replace_digits
    description: Modify the sequence by replacing digits within a specific range with the digit '1'.
    inputs:
      - sequence
      - start_index
      - end_index
      - replacement_value (which is '1' in this task)
    outputs:
      - modified sequence

relationships:
  - A subsequence's location is defined relative to the positions of zero_digits or the sequence boundaries.
  - The transformation targets the subsequence with the maximum length property.
