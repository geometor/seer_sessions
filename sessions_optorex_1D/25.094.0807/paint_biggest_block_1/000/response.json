The core operation seems to be identifying a specific contiguous subsequence of non-zero digits within the input sequence and replacing every digit in that subsequence with the digit `1`. The rule for selecting *which* subsequence to modify appears related to the position of `0` digits within the sequence and the length of the non-zero subsequences.\n\nBy analyzing the examples, it becomes clear that we need to consider three types of non-zero subsequences:\n1.  Those occurring *before* the first `0`.\n2.  Those occurring *between* two `0`s.\n3.  Those occurring *after* the last `0`.\n\nThe transformation targets the *longest* such subsequence found in the input. If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, the provided examples don't explicitly cover tie-breaking, but consistently applying the rule to *the* longest one (implying one unique longest or consistent selection if tied) works for all cases.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
