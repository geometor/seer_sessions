objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of digits
    description: An ordered sequence of single-digit integers (0-9).
    properties:
      - length
      - elements (digits at specific indices)
  - name: digit
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value (0-9)
      - position (index within the sequence)
  - name: zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 0
  - name: non_zero_digit
    type: digit
    properties:
      - value: 1-9
  - name: contiguous_non_zero_subsequence
    type: list of digits
    description: A maximal contiguous run of non_zero_digits within the main sequence. "Maximal" means it cannot be extended further left or right without including a zero_digit or exceeding the sequence bounds.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index of the first digit in the subsequence.
      - end_index: The index of the last digit in the subsequence.
      - length: The number of digits in the subsequence (end_index - start_index + 1).

actions:
  - name: identify_contiguous_non_zero_subsequences
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all maximal contiguous subsequences composed solely of non-zero digits.
    inputs:
      - sequence
    outputs:
      - list of contiguous_non_zero_subsequences (each represented by its start_index, end_index, and length).
  - name: find_longest_subsequence
    description: >
      From the list of identified subsequences, select the one with the maximum length.
      If multiple subsequences share the maximum length, select the one that appears earliest in the original sequence (i.e., the one with the minimum start_index among those tied for maximum length).
    inputs:
      - list of contiguous_non_zero_subsequences
    outputs:
      - the selected longest subsequence (start_index, end_index, length), or null/none if no non-zero subsequences exist.
  - name: replace_subsequence_digits
    description: Modify a copy of the input sequence by replacing the digits within the range specified by the selected longest subsequence.
    inputs:
      - sequence (original)
      - selected longest subsequence (start_index, end_index)
      - replacement_value (fixed as '1' for this task)
    outputs:
      - modified sequence (list of digits)

relationships:
  - A contiguous_non_zero_subsequence is bounded by zero_digits or the start/end of the main sequence.
  - The transformation targets exactly one subsequence: the one identified by the find_longest_subsequence action.
  - The replacement action modifies only the elements within the index range [start_index, end_index] of the selected subsequence.
