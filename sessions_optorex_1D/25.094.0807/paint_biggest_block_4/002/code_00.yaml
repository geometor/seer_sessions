Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: numpy.ndarray or List[int] # Updated type
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers provided as a NumPy array or list.
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int] # Output format might still be a list, then converted if needed.
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers, derived from the InputSequence.
  - Number:
      type: int
      properties:
        - value: The integer digit (0-9).
        - position: Index within the sequence.
        - is_zero: Boolean indicating if the value is 0.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      type: List[Number] # Conceptually, a list of numbers
      description: A contiguous subsequence of non-zero Numbers within the InputSequence.
      properties:
        - start_index: Position of the first number in the block.
        - end_index: Position of the last number in the block.
        - length: The count of numbers in the block.
        - members: The actual numbers comprising the block.

Relationships:
  - InputSequence contains Numbers.
  - InputSequence can be segmented into Zero numbers and one or more NonZeroBlocks.
  - OutputSequence corresponds element-wise to InputSequence, with potential modifications.
  - A specific NonZeroBlock from the InputSequence is targeted for modification based on length and position.

Actions:
  - Receive: Accept the InputSequence (as a NumPy array or List[int]). # Updated Action
  - Identify: Locate all contiguous NonZeroBlocks in the InputSequence.
  - Calculate: Determine the length of each NonZeroBlock.
  - Compare: Find the maximum length among all NonZeroBlocks.
  - Select: Choose the NonZeroBlock with the maximum length. If there are ties for maximum length, select the one with the smallest start_index (the first one encountered).
  - Modify: Create the OutputSequence by copying the InputSequence, then replace the value of each Number within the selected NonZeroBlock with `1`.
  - Preserve: Keep all zero Numbers and Numbers in non-selected NonZeroBlocks unchanged in the OutputSequence.
  - Return: Provide the OutputSequence (likely as a List[int] or converted back to the required format). # Updated Action
