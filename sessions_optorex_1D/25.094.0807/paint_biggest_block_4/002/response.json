            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe core issue identified across all examples is a type mismatch error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates the `transform` function was designed assuming a string input (`input_str`) which would then be split, but it's actually receiving a NumPy array directly.\n\nThe strategy is straightforward:\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list of integers) as input instead of a string.\n2.  Remove the initial string splitting and integer conversion step (`input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]`).\n3.  Assume the rest of the logic (finding blocks, identifying the longest/earliest block, and modifying it to `1`s) is potentially correct but needs validation once the input type issue is resolved.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Input Type:** Consistently identified as `numpy.ndarray` across all 7 training examples.\n*   **Error Type:** Consistent `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` across all 7 training examples.\n*   **Execution Status:** Failed for all examples due to the input type error. The core transformation logic was not reached or tested.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
