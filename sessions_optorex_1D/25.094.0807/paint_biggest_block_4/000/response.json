The output is also a sequence of single-digit integers, maintaining the same length as the input. The core operation involves identifying specific contiguous segments (blocks) of non-zero numbers within the input sequence and modifying one of these blocks in the output. The modification consists of changing every number within the selected block to the digit `1`. Zeros and numbers belonging to other non-zero blocks remain unchanged. The key seems to be selecting the *correct* block to modify. Comparing the lengths of the non-zero blocks appears crucial; the transformation targets the longest block. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the first one encountered (reading from left to right) is chosen.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
