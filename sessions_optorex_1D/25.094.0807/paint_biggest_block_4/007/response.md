"""
Transforms an input sequence (list or NumPy array) of integers by:
1. Identifying all contiguous blocks of non-zero numbers.
2. Determining the maximum length among these blocks.
3. Selecting the block with the maximum length. If multiple blocks share the maximum length, the one with the earliest starting index is chosen.
4. Creating a copy of the input sequence.
5. Modifying the copy by changing all numbers within the selected target block to 1.
6. Returning the modified copy, preserving the original data type (list or NumPy array). Zeros and numbers in non-selected blocks remain unchanged. If no non-zero blocks are found, the original sequence is returned unchanged.
