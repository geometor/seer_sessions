Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int] or numpy.ndarray (matches InputSequence type)
      description: A sequence derived from InputSequence, same length.
  - Element:
      type: int
      properties:
        - value: The integer digit (0-9).
        - index: Position (0-based) within the sequence.
  - NonZeroBlock:
      type: Conceptual grouping
      description: A contiguous subsequence of non-zero Elements within the InputSequence.
      properties:
        - start_index: Index of the first element in the block.
        - end_index: Index of the last element in the block.
        - length: The count of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).

Relationships:
  - InputSequence is composed of Elements.
  - InputSequence can be segmented into zero-value Elements and one or more NonZeroBlocks.
  - OutputSequence is initially a copy of InputSequence.
  - One specific NonZeroBlock from InputSequence determines the modification range in OutputSequence.

Actions:
  - Identify_Blocks: Scan InputSequence to find all NonZeroBlocks, recording their start_index, end_index, and length.
  - Calculate_Max_Length: Determine the maximum length among all identified NonZeroBlocks.
  - Filter_Longest_Blocks: Create a subset of NonZeroBlocks that have the maximum length.
  - Select_Target_Block: From the subset of longest blocks, choose the one with the minimum start_index. Handle the case where no non-zero blocks exist.
  - Create_Output_Copy: Initialize OutputSequence as a distinct copy of InputSequence.
  - Modify_Target_Range: If a Target_Block was selected, iterate from its start_index to its end_index (inclusive). For each index in this range, set the value of the corresponding Element in the OutputSequence copy to 1.
  - Return_Result: Provide the modified OutputSequence copy. Preserve the original data type (list or NumPy array).
