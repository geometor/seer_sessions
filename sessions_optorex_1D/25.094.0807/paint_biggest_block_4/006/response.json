            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the hypothesized transformation rule: identify the longest contiguous block of non-zero numbers (choosing the earliest if tied) and replace its elements with `1`. However, the results show that the `transform` function consistently returns the original input unchanged for all examples. This indicates a flaw in the implementation, likely within the modification step or how data structures (lists/arrays) are being handled, rather than an incorrect understanding of the core transformation rule itself.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the correctness of the block identification and selection logic using `tool_code`.\n2.  Verify that the modification step (changing elements to `1`) is correctly applied to the intended data structure.\n3.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts based on this verification, ensuring clarity on the process. The core logic described previously appears sound based on the input/output pairs, suggesting the implementation is the primary issue.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the block identification and target selection for each training example.\n\n"
