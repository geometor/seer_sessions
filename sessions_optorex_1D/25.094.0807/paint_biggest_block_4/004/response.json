            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided execution results indicate a consistent failure mode: the output sequence is identical to the input sequence for all examples. This suggests that the core transformation logic\u2014changing the elements of the selected block to `1`\u2014is not being applied. Based on the provided code structure, this points to a failure in either identifying the non-zero blocks (`find_nonzero_blocks`) or selecting the correct target block (`find_target_block`). The most likely scenario, given that the output always matches the input, is that `find_target_block` consistently returns `None`, likely because `find_nonzero_blocks` returns an empty list, or there's a flaw in the selection logic itself within `find_target_block`.\n\nThe manual traces performed during thought suggest the logic presented in the code *should* work. The discrepancy implies either a subtle bug missed in the manual trace (perhaps related to edge cases like blocks at the very end or beginning of the sequence, or sequences with no zeros) or an issue with the exact code version or environment used during the test execution.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Block Identification:** Re-run the logic for identifying non-zero blocks and selecting the target block for each example to confirm the expected intermediate results (blocks found, target block selected). This will validate the core understanding of the task.\n2.  **Refine Implementation:** Assume there might be a subtle bug in the provided `find_nonzero_blocks` or `find_target_block` functions, particularly around edge cases (e.g., blocks ending exactly at the list's end). Use a slightly revised implementation for analysis and the subsequent coding phase.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to ensure maximum clarity, especially regarding the block identification and selection criteria (longest length, then earliest start index).\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n\nUsing the refined helper functions (`find_nonzero_blocks_revised`, `find_target_block`) to analyze the intermediate steps for each example:\n"
