Objects:
  - InputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers.
  - OutputSequence:
      type: List[int]
      description: A sequence of single-digit integers derived from InputSequence, having the same length.
  - Number:
      type: int
      properties:
        - value: The integer digit (0-9).
        - position: Index within the sequence (0-based).
  - NonZeroBlock:
      type: Dict
      description: Represents a contiguous subsequence of non-zero Numbers within the InputSequence.
      properties:
        - start: The starting index (inclusive) of the block in InputSequence.
        - end: The ending index (inclusive) of the block in InputSequence.
        - length: The count of numbers in the block (end - start + 1).

Relationships:
  - InputSequence is composed of Numbers (integers).
  - InputSequence can be partitioned into segments of zero-value Numbers and one or more NonZeroBlocks.
  - OutputSequence is derived from InputSequence.
  - A single NonZeroBlock from the InputSequence is designated as the 'TargetBlock'.

Actions:
  - Identify_Blocks: Scan InputSequence to find all NonZeroBlocks, recording their 'start', 'end', and 'length'.
  - Determine_Max_Length: Find the maximum 'length' among all identified NonZeroBlocks.
  - Filter_Longest: Create a temporary list containing only NonZeroBlocks whose 'length' equals the maximum length.
  - Select_Target_Block: From the list of longest blocks, choose the one with the minimum 'start' index. This is the TargetBlock. If no NonZeroBlocks exist, there is no TargetBlock.
  - Initialize_Output: Create OutputSequence as a copy of InputSequence.
  - Modify_Target_Block: If a TargetBlock was selected, iterate from its 'start' index to its 'end' index (inclusive). For each index `i` in this range, set the value of OutputSequence at index `i` to `1`.
  - Preserve_Others: All Numbers in OutputSequence outside the index range of the TargetBlock retain their original values from InputSequence.
