            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The previous code failed because it assumed the input was a string (`input_str`) and tried to use the `.split()` method. However, the error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` indicates the input is actually being provided as a NumPy array (or a similar sequence type like a list). The core transformation logic (finding the first longest run of non-zero identical digits and replacing it with 1s) described in the initial analysis appears consistent with the examples. The strategy is to modify the input handling to accept a sequence of integers directly and return a sequence of integers, removing the string parsing and formatting steps.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    *   All 7 training examples failed due to the same `AttributeError`.\n    *   The error consistently points to the input type being `numpy.ndarray` instead of the expected `str`.\n    *   The underlying logic of finding runs and replacement was not tested due to the input type mismatch.\n    *   No code execution is needed to gather further metrics at this stage, as the error source is clear.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
