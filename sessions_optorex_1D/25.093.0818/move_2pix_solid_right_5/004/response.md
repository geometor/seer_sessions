*   **General Assessment:** The core transformation logic identified previously (finding a contiguous block of non-zero identical numbers and shifting it two positions right) appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples. The failure reported during testing (`invalid literal for int() with base 10`) points directly to an issue in the input parsing step. The `transform` function received the input as a string representation of a list or array (e.g., `'[0 0 0 ...]'`) rather than a simple space-separated string (e.g., `'0 0 0 ...'`). The fix involves modifying the input processing to remove the surrounding brackets `[` and `]` before splitting the string by spaces and converting the elements to integers. The underlying NumPy-based logic for shifting the block seems appropriate for this kind of array manipulation.

*   **Metrics Gathering:** The provided error logs consistently show the `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10` when processing the input string. This occurs because the input string includes list/array brackets (`[` and `]`), which are not valid integers.

    Let's verify the transformation logic conceptually with one example:
    *   **Example 4 Input:** `0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
    *   Non-zero block: `8 8 8 8`
    *   Start index: 1
    *   End index: 4
    *   Shift amount: +2
    *   New start index: 1 + 2 = 3
    *   New end index: 4 + 2 = 6
    *   **Expected Output:** Place `8 8 8 8` starting at index 3. Result: `0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0`. This matches the provided `train_4` output.

    The logic holds for other examples as well:
    *   Example 1: Block `6 6` at index 7,8 -> shifts to index 9,10.
    *   Example 3: Block `9` at index 0 -> shifts to index 2.
    *   Example 7: Block `6 6` at index 8,9 -> shifts to index 10,11.

    The core algorithm is sound; only the initial data ingestion needs correction.

    relationships:
      - The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by applying the shift operation to the identified non_zero_block.
      - The new start index = original start index + 2.
      - The new end index = original end index + 2.
    constraints:
      - Input sequence always contains exactly one contiguous block of non-zero numbers.
      - The shift amount is always +2 positions to the right.
      - The sequence length is fixed at 12.
      - Input format requires specific parsing to handle brackets.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a string (e.g., `"[0 0 8 8 0 ...]"`) .
    2.  Clean the input string: Remove the leading `[` character and the trailing `]` character.
    3.  Parse the cleaned string: Split the string by spaces and convert each resulting substring into an integer to form the `input_sequence` (list or array).
    4.  Determine the length of the `input_sequence`.
    5.  Initialize an `output_sequence` (list or array) of the same length, filled with zeros.
    6.  Find the starting index (`start_index`) and ending index (`end_index`) of the contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the `input_sequence`. If no non-zero numbers exist, skip to step 9.
    7.  Calculate the `new_start_index` by adding 2 to the `start_index`.
    8.  Copy the elements of the non-zero block (from `start_index` to `end_index` in the `input_sequence`) into the `output_sequence`, starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure that copying stops if the index goes beyond the bounds of the `output_sequence` (i.e., elements shifted off the right end are discarded).
    9.  Convert the elements of the `output_sequence` into strings.
    10. Join the string elements with single spaces in between to create the final `output_string`.
    11. Return the `output_string`.
