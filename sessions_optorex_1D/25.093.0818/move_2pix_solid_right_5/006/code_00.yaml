task_type: sequence_manipulation
input_format: sequence of 12 integers, potentially represented as:
  - space-separated string (e.g., "0 0 6 6 0 ...")
  - list containing a single space-separated string (e.g., ['0 0 6 6 0 ...'])
  - list of integers (e.g., [0, 0, 6, 6, 0, ...])
  - 1D numpy array
output_format: space-separated string of 12 integers
sequence_length: 12 (constant)
elements:
  - type: integer
    value: 0 (background/padding)
  - type: integer
    value: non-zero (forms a single contiguous block)

  - name: input_sequence

    type: sublist_or_subarray_of_integers

    properties:
      - length_is_12
      - filled_with_zeros_initially
actions:
  - name: parse_input
    description: Convert the input data (string, list, array) into a standard 1D integer array format. Handle potential variations like a list containing a single string.
  - name: identify_block
    description: Find the start and end indices of the contiguous non_zero_block in the parsed input_sequence.
  - name: shift_block
    description: Calculate the new start index (original start index + 2) and determine the portion of the block that fits within the sequence boundaries after the shift.
  - name: construct_output
    description: Create the output_sequence by placing the (potentially truncated) non_zero_block at its new position (shifted right by 2) and filling all other positions with zeros.
  - name: format_output
    description: Convert the final integer array into a space-separated string.
relationships:
  - The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by applying the shift_block action to the identified non_zero_block.
  - The new start index of the block in the output is the original start index + 2.
  - Elements of the block that shift beyond the sequence boundary (index 11) are discarded.
constraints:
  - Input sequence always contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers.
  - The shift amount is always +2 positions to the right.
  - Sequence length is fixed at 12.
