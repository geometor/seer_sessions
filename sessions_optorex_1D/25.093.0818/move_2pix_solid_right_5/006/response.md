**General Assessment:**

The core transformation logic identified previously (find a contiguous non-zero block and shift it right by 2 positions) appears consistent across all provided training examples. The errors reported during testing (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...`) stem uniformly from the input parsing stage, not the transformation logic itself. The error message suggests that the `int()` constructor is receiving a multi-number string (e.g., "0 0 6 6 0") instead of a single number string (e.g., "6"). This likely indicates that the input format passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment might be slightly different than assumed (e.g., a list containing a single string `['0 0 6 6 0']` instead of just the string `"0 0 6 6 0"`). The strategy is to make the input parsing function (`_parse_input`) more robust to handle potential variations in how the space-separated integer sequence is presented, particularly the case of a list containing a single string element.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The following metrics can be derived from the examples, confirming the pattern:

*   All input and output sequences have a length of 12.
*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
*   The transformation consistently shifts this block exactly 2 positions to the right.
*   Positions outside the shifted block in the output are always 0.

Let's verify the block details for each example:

*   **train_1:** Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0]`. Block `[6, 6]` at indices 7-8. Shifted to indices 9-10. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0]`
*   **train_2:** Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[1, 1]` at indices 6-7. Shifted to indices 8-9. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0]`
*   **train_3:** Input: `[9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[9]` at index 0. Shifted to index 2. Output: `[0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **train_4:** Input: `[0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[8, 8, 8, 8]` at indices 1-4. Shifted to indices 3-6. Output: `[0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]`
*   **train_5:** Input: `[6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` at indices 0-5. Shifted to indices 2-7. Output: `[0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0]`
*   **train_6:** Input: `[1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` at indices 0-5. Shifted to indices 2-7. Output: `[0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]`
*   **train_7:** Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0]`. Block `[6, 6]` at indices 8-9. Shifted to indices 10-11. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6]`

The pattern is perfectly consistent. No code execution is needed to verify these simple arithmetic shifts and block identifications from the examples. The focus remains on fixing the input parsing.

relationships:
  - The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by applying the shift_block action to the identified non_zero_block.
  - The new start index of the block in the output is the original start index + 2.
  - Elements of the block that shift beyond the sequence boundary (index 11) are discarded.
constraints:
  - Input sequence always contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers.
  - The shift amount is always +2 positions to the right.
  - Sequence length is fixed at 12.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  **Parse Input:** Receive the input data. Determine its format (e.g., string, list of strings, list of integers, numpy array). Convert it into a standard 1D array/list of 12 integers (`input_sequence`). Handle specifically the case where the input might be a list containing a single element which is a space-separated string.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new array/list (`output_sequence`) of 12 zeros.
3.  **Find Non-Zero Block:** Iterate through the `input_sequence` to find the index of the first non-zero element (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero element (`end_index`). If no non-zero elements are found, proceed to step 7.
4.  **Extract Block:** Identify the sub-sequence from `input_sequence` spanning `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). This is the `non_zero_block`.
5.  **Calculate New Position:** Determine the target starting index for the block in the `output_sequence` as `new_start_index = start_index + 2`.
6.  **Place Shifted Block:** Iterate through the `non_zero_block`. For each element at index `i` within the block (where `i` ranges from 0 to the block's length minus 1), calculate its target index in the `output_sequence` as `target_index = new_start_index + i`. If `target_index` is less than 12 (the sequence length), place the element at `output_sequence[target_index]`. Otherwise, the element is shifted off the end and discarded.
7.  **Format Output:** Convert the `output_sequence` (which now contains the shifted block and zeros) into a space-separated string.
8.  **Return Result:** Return the formatted string.
