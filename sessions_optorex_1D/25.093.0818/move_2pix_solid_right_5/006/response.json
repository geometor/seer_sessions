            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (find a contiguous non-zero block and shift it right by 2 positions) appears consistent across all provided training examples. The errors reported during testing (`invalid literal for int() with base 10: ...`) stem uniformly from the input parsing stage, not the transformation logic itself. The error message suggests that the `int()` constructor is receiving a multi-number string (e.g., \"0 0 6 6 0\") instead of a single number string (e.g., \"6\"). This likely indicates that the input format passed to the `transform` function by the testing environment might be slightly different than assumed (e.g., a list containing a single string `['0 0 6 6 0']` instead of just the string `\"0 0 6 6 0\"`). The strategy is to make the input parsing function (`_parse_input`) more robust to handle potential variations in how the space-separated integer sequence is presented, particularly the case of a list containing a single string element.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe following metrics can be derived from the examples, confirming the pattern:\n\n*   All input and output sequences have a length of 12.\n*   Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.\n*   The transformation consistently shifts this block exactly 2 positions to the right.\n*   Positions outside the shifted block in the output are always 0.\n\nLet's verify the block details for each example:\n\n*   **train_1:** Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0]`. Block `[6, 6]` at indices 7-8. Shifted to indices 9-10. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0]`\n*   **train_2:** Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[1, 1]` at indices 6-7. Shifted to indices 8-9. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0]`\n*   **train_3:** Input: `[9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[9]` at index 0. Shifted to index 2. Output: `[0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n*   **train_4:** Input: `[0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[8, 8, 8, 8]` at indices 1-4. Shifted to indices 3-6. Output: `[0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]`\n*   **train_5:** Input: `[6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` at indices 0-5. Shifted to indices 2-7. Output: `[0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0]`\n*   **train_6:** Input: `[1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` at indices 0-5. Shifted to indices 2-7. Output: `[0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]`\n*   **train_7:** Input: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0]`. Block `[6, 6]` at indices 8-9. Shifted to indices 10-11. Output: `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6]`\n\nThe pattern is perfectly consistent. No code execution is needed to verify these simple arithmetic shifts and block identifications from the examples. The focus remains on fixing the input parsing.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"

Handle specifically the case where the input might be a list containing a single element which is a space-separated string.\n2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new array/list (`output_sequence`) of 12 zeros.\n3.  **Find Non-Zero Block:** Iterate through the `input_sequence` to find the index of the first non-zero element (`start_index`) and the index of the last non-zero element (`end_index`). If no non-zero elements are found, proceed to step 7.\n4.  **Extract Block:** Identify the sub-sequence from `input_sequence` spanning `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive). This is the `non_zero_block`.\n5.  **Calculate New Position:** Determine the target starting index for the block in the `output_sequence` as `new_start_index = start_index + 2`.\n6.  **Place Shifted Block:** Iterate through the `non_zero_block`. For each element at index `i` within the block (where `i` ranges from 0 to the block's length minus 1), calculate its target index in the `output_sequence` as `target_index = new_start_index + i`. If `target_index` is less than 12 (the sequence length), place the element at `output_sequence[target_index]`. Otherwise, the element is shifted off the end and discarded.\n7.  **Format Output:** Convert the `output_sequence` (which now contains the shifted block and zeros) into a space-separated string.\n8.  **Return Result:** Return the formatted string."
