*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating a sequence of twelve integers. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers, padded with zeros on either side. The transformation consists of shifting this entire non-zero block exactly two positions to the right within the sequence. The positions originally occupied by the block, and any positions to its left that are not taken up by the shifted block, become zeros. The length of the sequence remains constant at twelve.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers (the `input_sequence`).
    2.  Determine the length of the `input_sequence`.
    3.  Initialize an `output_sequence` as a list of zeros with the same length.
    4.  Find the starting index (`start_index`) of the first non-zero element in the `input_sequence`. If no non-zero element exists, the `output_sequence` remains all zeros.
    5.  Find the ending index (`end_index`) of the last non-zero element in the `input_sequence`.
    6.  Extract the sublist containing the non-zero block from the `input_sequence`, ranging from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
    7.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the `output_sequence` as `new_start_index = start_index + 2`.
    8.  Iterate through the extracted non-zero block elements. For each element at index `i` within the block (where `i` ranges from 0 to `end_index - start_index`), place it into the `output_sequence` at index `new_start_index + i`. Ensure indices remain within the bounds of the `output_sequence`.
    9.  Convert the `output_sequence` (list of integers) back into a space-separated string for the final output.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue identified by the errors is an incorrect assumption about the input data type. The `transform` function was designed to accept a string of space-separated integers (`input_str`) and used the `.split()` method. However, the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates that the function is actually receiving a NumPy array as input during testing. The core logic of identifying the contiguous non-zero block and shifting it two positions to the right appears consistent with the examples. The strategy is to modify the function to accept a NumPy array directly, perform the operations using array indexing and manipulation, and then format the output back into a space-separated string as shown in the examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    The code failed during the input parsing stage for all examples due to the type mismatch. Therefore, metrics related to the transformation logic (e.g., identified block indices, shift accuracy) cannot be gathered from the failed execution. The critical piece of information derived is the input type: `numpy.ndarray`. Let's confirm the structure.
