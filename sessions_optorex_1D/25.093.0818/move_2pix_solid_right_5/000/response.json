Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers, padded with zeros on either side. The transformation consists of shifting this entire non-zero block exactly two positions to the right within the sequence. The positions originally occupied by the block, and any positions to its left that are not taken up by the shifted block, become zeros. The length of the sequence remains constant at twelve.\n\n*   **Facts:**\n    "

Calculate the new starting index for the block in the `output_sequence` as `new_start_index = start_index + 2`.\n    8.  Iterate through the extracted non-zero block elements. For each element at index `i` within the block (where `i` ranges from 0 to `end_index - start_index`), place it into the `output_sequence` at index `new_start_index + i`. Ensure indices remain within the bounds of the `output_sequence`.\n    9.  Convert the `output_sequence` (list of integers) back into a space-separated string for the final output."
