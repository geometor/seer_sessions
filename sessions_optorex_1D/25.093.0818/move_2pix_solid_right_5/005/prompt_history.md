*   **Perception:** The task involves manipulating a sequence of twelve integers. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers, padded with zeros on either side. The transformation consists of shifting this entire non-zero block exactly two positions to the right within the sequence. The positions originally occupied by the block, and any positions to its left that are not taken up by the shifted block, become zeros. The length of the sequence remains constant at twelve.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers (the `input_sequence`).
    2.  Determine the length of the `input_sequence`.
    3.  Initialize an `output_sequence` as a list of zeros with the same length.
    4.  Find the starting index (`start_index`) of the first non-zero element in the `input_sequence`. If no non-zero element exists, the `output_sequence` remains all zeros.
    5.  Find the ending index (`end_index`) of the last non-zero element in the `input_sequence`.
    6.  Extract the sublist containing the non-zero block from the `input_sequence`, ranging from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).
    7.  Calculate the new starting index for the block in the `output_sequence` as `new_start_index = start_index + 2`.
    8.  Iterate through the extracted non-zero block elements. For each element at index `i` within the block (where `i` ranges from 0 to `end_index - start_index`), place it into the `output_sequence` at index `new_start_index + i`. Ensure indices remain within the bounds of the `output_sequence`.
    9.  Convert the `output_sequence` (list of integers) back into a space-separated string for the final output.

*   **General Assessment:** The core transformation logic identified previously (finding a contiguous block of non-zero identical numbers and shifting it two positions right) appears correct and consistent across all provided training examples. The failure reported during testing (`invalid literal for int() with base 10`) points directly to an issue in the input parsing step. The `transform` function received the input as a string representation of a list or array (e.g., `'[0 0 0 ...]'`) rather than a simple space-separated string (e.g., `'0 0 0 ...'`). The fix involves modifying the input processing to remove the surrounding brackets `[` and `]` before splitting the string by spaces and converting the elements to integers. The underlying NumPy-based logic for shifting the block seems appropriate for this kind of array manipulation.

*   **Metrics Gathering:** The provided error logs consistently show the `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10` when processing the input string. This occurs because the input string includes list/array brackets (`[` and `]`), which are not valid integers.

    Let's verify the transformation logic conceptually with one example:
    *   **Example 4 Input:** `0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
    *   Non-zero block: `8 8 8 8`
    *   Start index: 1
    *   End index: 4
    *   Shift amount: +2
    *   New start index: 1 + 2 = 3
    *   New end index: 4 + 2 = 6
    *   **Expected Output:** Place `8 8 8 8` starting at index 3. Result: `0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0`. This matches the provided `train_4` output.

    The logic holds for other examples as well:
    *   Example 1: Block `6 6` at index 7,8 -> shifts to index 9,10.
    *   Example 3: Block `9` at index 0 -> shifts to index 2.
    *   Example 7: Block `6 6` at index 8,9 -> shifts to index 10,11.

    The core algorithm is sound; only the initial data ingestion needs correction.

*   **Natural Language Program:**

    7.  Calculate the `new_start_index` by adding 2 to the `start_index`.
    8.  Copy the elements of the non-zero block (from `start_index` to `end_index` in the `input_sequence`) into the `output_sequence`, starting at `new_start_index`. Ensure that copying stops if the index goes beyond the bounds of the `output_sequence` (i.e., elements shifted off the right end are discarded).
    9.  Convert the elements of the `output_sequence` into strings.
