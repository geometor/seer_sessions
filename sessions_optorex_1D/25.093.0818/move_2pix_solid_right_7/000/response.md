Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task operates on a sequence of single digits. Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros (or potentially at the beginning/end of the sequence). The transformation consistently shifts this non-zero block two positions to the right within the sequence. The length of the sequence remains unchanged. Zeros fill the positions vacated by the shifted block on the left, and any part of the block shifted beyond the original sequence length is effectively lost (though in the examples, the right padding seems sufficient).

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Data:
  type: sequence
  element_type: digit
  length: 12 (consistent across examples)

Objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
      - padded with zeros

  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub_sequence
    properties:
      - elements are identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous
    relationships:
      - located within input_sequence

  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - same length as input_sequence
    relationships:
      - derived from input_sequence

Actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index

  - name: shift_block_right
    inputs: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index
    parameters:
      shift_amount: 2
    outputs: new_start_index, new_end_index

  - name: construct_output
    inputs: input_sequence_length, non_zero_block, new_start_index, new_end_index
    process: Create a sequence of zeros, then place the non_zero_block at the new indices.
    outputs: output_sequence

Relationships:
  - The non_zero_block in the output_sequence is identical to the one in the input_sequence.
  - The start index of the non_zero_block in the output_sequence is the start index from the input_sequence plus 2.
  - The output_sequence maintains the same length as the input_sequence.
  - Positions in the output_sequence not occupied by the shifted non_zero_block are filled with zeros.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero digits within the input sequence. Record the digit value, the start index, and the end index of this block.
2.  Create a new output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, initially filled entirely with zeros.
3.  Calculate the target start index for the block in the output sequence by adding 2 to the original start index found in step 1.
4.  Calculate the target end index for the block in the output sequence by adding 2 to the original end index found in step 1.
5.  Iterate from the target start index up to the target end index (inclusive). For each position within this range in the output sequence, place the recorded non-zero digit value, ensuring index boundaries are respected (though examples don't show boundary overflows).
6.  Return the resulting output sequence.
