Data:
  type: sequence
  element_type: digit
  length: 12 (consistent across examples)

Objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
      - padded with zeros

  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub_sequence
    properties:
      - elements are identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous
    relationships:
      - located within input_sequence

  - name: output_sequence
    type: list_of_digits
    properties:
      - same length as input_sequence
    relationships:
      - derived from input_sequence

Actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index

  - name: shift_block_right
    inputs: non_zero_block, start_index, end_index
    parameters:
      shift_amount: 2
    outputs: new_start_index, new_end_index

  - name: construct_output
    inputs: input_sequence_length, non_zero_block, new_start_index, new_end_index
    process: Create a sequence of zeros, then place the non_zero_block at the new indices.
    outputs: output_sequence

Relationships:
  - The non_zero_block in the output_sequence is identical to the one in the input_sequence.
  - The start index of the non_zero_block in the output_sequence is the start index from the input_sequence plus 2.
  - The output_sequence maintains the same length as the input_sequence.
  - Positions in the output_sequence not occupied by the shifted non_zero_block are filled with zeros.
