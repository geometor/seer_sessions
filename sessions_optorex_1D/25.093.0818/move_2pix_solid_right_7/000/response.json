Each input sequence contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros (or potentially at the beginning/end of the sequence). The transformation consistently shifts this non-zero block two positions to the right within the sequence. The length of the sequence remains unchanged. Zeros fill the positions vacated by the shifted block on the left, and any part of the block shifted beyond the original sequence length is effectively lost (though in the examples, the right padding seems sufficient).\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
