**General Assessment:**

The previous execution attempt failed due to a type mismatch error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). This indicates that the `transform` function, which was designed to accept a space-separated string of digits, was incorrectly called with a NumPy array during the testing phase. The underlying logic of identifying a contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it two positions to the right appears sound based on the initial examples and the problem description. The strategy for resolution is to ensure the `transform` function receives input in the expected string format during execution. The core algorithm itself does not need modification based on this specific error.

**Metrics and Observations:**

All provided training examples (`train_1` through `train_7`) follow a consistent pattern:

1.  **Input Format:** A sequence of 12 digits, represented as a space-separated string.
2.  **Content:** Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `6 6 6 6 6 6 6`, `8 8 8 8 8`, `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`, `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3`, `8 8 8`, `1 1 1 1`, `9 9 9 9 9 9 9`). The remaining digits are zeros.
3.  **Transformation:** The contiguous block of non-zero digits is shifted exactly two positions to the right.
4.  **Output Format:** A sequence of 12 digits, represented as a space-separated string, reflecting the shifted block.
5.  **Padding:** Positions vacated by the shift on the left, and any positions not filled by the shifted block, are filled with zeros. The length remains 12.
6.  **Boundary Handling:** The shift operation respects the sequence boundaries. If a block starts at index `s` and ends at index `e`, the new block starts at index `s+2` and ends at index `min(e+2, length-1)`.

The error encountered during testing was uniform across all examples and related to input type handling, not the transformation logic itself.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Input:
  type: string
  format: space-separated digits
  length: 12 (consistent)
  structure: Contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits surrounded by zeros.

Output:
  type: string
  format: space-separated digits
  length: 12 (consistent)
  structure: Derived from input by shifting the non-zero block.

Objects:
  - name: digit_sequence
    source: input_string (parsed)
    type: list_or_array_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12

  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub_sequence
    properties:
      - elements: identical non-zero integers
      - contiguous: true
      - source_digit: the repeated non-zero digit
      - source_start_index: the starting index in the input sequence
      - source_end_index: the ending index (inclusive) in the input sequence
      - length: (source_end_index - source_start_index + 1)

Transformation_Rule:
  action: shift_right
  target: non_zero_block
  parameter:
    shift_amount: 2
  result:
    - new_start_index: source_start_index + 2
    - new_end_index: source_end_index + 2

Output_Construction:
  process:
    1. Initialize an output sequence of length 12 with all zeros.
    2. Identify the `non_zero_block` (digit, start index, end index) in the input sequence.
    3. Calculate the target start index: `new_start_index = source_start_index + 2`.
    4. Calculate the target end index: `new_end_index = source_end_index + 2`.
    5. Iterate from `new_start_index` up to `min(new_end_index, 11)`.
    6. For each index in this range, set the value in the output sequence to `source_digit`.
  final_format: Convert the resulting integer sequence back to a space-separated string.

Constraints:
  - Input always contains exactly one non-zero block.
  - Input and output length are always 12.
  - Shift amount is always 2 to the right.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a single string containing 12 space-separated digits.
2.  Parse the input string into a sequence (e.g., a list or array) of 12 integers.
3.  Initialize an output sequence of 12 integers, filled with zeros.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-zero digit. Let this digit be `D` and its index be `start_index`.
5.  Continue iterating from `start_index` to find the end of the contiguous block of digit `D`. Let the index of the last occurrence of `D` in this block be `end_index`.
6.  Calculate the target starting position for the block in the output sequence: `new_start_index = start_index + 2`.
7.  Calculate the target ending position for the block in the output sequence: `new_end_index = end_index + 2`.
8.  Iterate from `i = new_start_index` up to `new_end_index`. If `i` is a valid index within the output sequence (i.e., `0 <= i < 12`), set the element at index `i` in the output sequence to the digit `D`.
9.  Convert the integers in the output sequence back into strings.
10. Join the string representations of the digits in the output sequence with single spaces to form the final output string.
11. Return the final output string.
