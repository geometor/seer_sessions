            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous execution attempt failed due to a type mismatch error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`). This indicates that the `transform` function, which was designed to accept a space-separated string of digits, was incorrectly called with a NumPy array during the testing phase. The underlying logic of identifying a contiguous block of non-zero digits and shifting it two positions to the right appears sound based on the initial examples and the problem description. The strategy for resolution is to ensure the `transform` function receives input in the expected string format during execution. The core algorithm itself does not need modification based on this specific error.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\nAll provided training examples (`train_1` through `train_7`) follow a consistent pattern:\n\n1.  **Input Format:** A sequence of 12 digits, represented as a space-separated string.\n2.  **Content:** Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (e.g., `6 6 6 6 6 6 6`, `8 8 8 8 8`, `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`, `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3`, `8 8 8`, `1 1 1 1`, `9 9 9 9 9 9 9`). The remaining digits are zeros.\n3.  **Transformation:** The contiguous block of non-zero digits is shifted exactly two positions to the right.\n4.  **Output Format:** A sequence of 12 digits, represented as a space-separated string, reflecting the shifted block.\n5.  **Padding:** Positions vacated by the shift on the left, and any positions not filled by the shifted block, are filled with zeros. The length remains 12.\n6.  **Boundary Handling:** The shift operation respects the sequence boundaries. If a block starts at index `s` and ends at index `e`, the new block starts at index `s+2` and ends at index `min(e+2, length-1)`.\n\nThe error encountered during testing was uniform across all examples and related to input type handling, not the transformation logic itself.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
