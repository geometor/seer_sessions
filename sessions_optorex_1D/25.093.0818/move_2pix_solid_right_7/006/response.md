**General Assessment and Strategy**

The provided code failed consistently across all examples with the error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This error occurs within the `transform` function at the line: `input_sequence = np.array([int(d) for d in input_str.split()], dtype=int)`.

This indicates that the `transform` function, designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str: str`), was actually called with a NumPy array as its input during the testing phase. The NumPy array does not have a `.split()` method, leading to the error.

The strategy to resolve this is:

1.  **Modify the function signature and input handling:** Change the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array directly, eliminating the need for the `.split()` operation.
2.  **Verify Core Logic:** Since the error occurred before the main transformation logic was executed, assume the core logic (finding the block, calculating the shift, creating the output) might be correct but needs verification against the examples once the input type issue is resolved.
3.  **Maintain Output Format:** Ensure the function still returns a space-separated string as required by the original specification and example outputs.

**Metrics Gathering**

To understand the characteristics of the non-zero blocks in each example, let's analyze the inputs and expected outputs. We'll assume the code is modified to handle array inputs correctly.

```yaml
Data:
  type: sequence
  element_type: integer_digit (0-9)
  representation: 1D NumPy array (inferred from execution error)
  length: 12 (consistent across examples)

Objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: numpy_array_of_integers
    properties:
      - contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits
      - remaining elements are zeros
      - fixed length (12)

  - name: non_zero_block
    type: logical_sub_sequence # Not explicitly extracted as a separate array
    properties:
      - elements are identical non-zero digits
      - contiguous
    attributes:
      - digit_value: The non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 8, 7)
      - start_index: The 0-based index where the block begins in the input_sequence
      - end_index: The 0-based index where the block ends (inclusive) in the input_sequence
      - length: Number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1)

  - name: output_sequence
    type: numpy_array_of_integers
    properties:
      - same length as input_sequence (12)
      - contains the same non_zero_block as the input, shifted
      - remaining elements are zeros
    relationships:
      - derived from input_sequence

Actions:
  - name: identify_non_zero_block
    inputs: input_sequence (numpy_array)
    outputs: digit_value, start_index, end_index, block_length

  - name: calculate_shifted_position
    inputs: start_index, end_index, block_length
    parameters:
      shift_amount: 2 (constant)
      sequence_length: 12 (constant)
    outputs: new_start_index, new_end_boundary # (exclusive index for slicing)
    process: |
      new_start_index = start_index + shift_amount
      new_end_boundary = min(new_start_index + block_length, sequence_length)

  - name: construct_output
    inputs: sequence_length, digit_value, new_start_index, new_end_boundary
    process: |
      1. Create a numpy array of sequence_length filled with zeros.
      2. If new_start_index is less than sequence_length:
         Assign digit_value to the slice of the output array from 
         new_start_index up to (but not including) new_end_boundary.
    outputs: output_sequence (numpy_array)

  - name: format_output_string
    inputs: output_sequence (numpy_array)
    outputs: output_string (space-separated digits)
    process: Convert each integer in the array to a string and join with spaces.


Relationships:
  - The non_zero_block (digit value and length) is preserved between input and output.
  - The start index of the non_zero_block in the output_sequence is exactly 2 greater than the start index in the input_sequence.
  - The output_sequence has the same length as the input_sequence.
  - Positions in the output_sequence not occupied by the shifted non_zero_block are filled with zeros.
  - Any part of the block that would be shifted beyond the sequence length is truncated (implicitly handled by slicing with boundary checks).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input as a sequence (list or array) of integers. Let its length be `N`.
2.  Identify the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Record the digit's value (`D`), the block's starting index (`S_in`), and the block's ending index (`E_in`).
3.  Calculate the length of the block: `L = E_in - S_in + 1`.
4.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the output sequence: `S_out = S_in + 2`.
5.  Calculate the target ending boundary (the index *after* the last element) for the block in the output sequence, ensuring it does not exceed the sequence length `N`: `E_boundary_out = min(S_out + L, N)`.
6.  Create a new output sequence of length `N`, initially filled entirely with zeros.
7.  If the calculated target starting index `S_out` is less than `N` (meaning at least part of the shifted block fits within the sequence):
    a.  Place the digit value `D` into the output sequence at all positions from index `S_out` up to (but not including) index `E_boundary_out`.
8.  Convert the resulting output sequence of integers into a string where each integer is separated by a single space.
9.  Return the final space-separated string.
