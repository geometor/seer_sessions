Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   Each input and output is a sequence (list) of integers.
    *   The length of the sequence appears constant across all examples (12 elements).
    *   The sequences contain predominantly zeros (0).
    *   Each sequence also contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`, `9`, `6 6 6 6 6`, `1`).
    *   The transformation involves changing the positions of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the block of non-zero numbers moves.

*   **YAML Facts:**

      target: block
      details:
        - amount: 2 positions
        - mechanism: The entire block moves two indices to the right.
        - fill_value: Zeros fill the positions originally occupied by the block (unless overwritten by the shifted block itself) and any remaining positions.
    relationship:
      - The position of the block in the output list is determined by its position in the input list plus the shift amount.
    constraints:
      - The length of the list remains unchanged.
      - The values and the length of the non-zero block remain unchanged.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` consistently occurred across all examples. This indicates that the `transform` function received input data as a NumPy array, not the expected space-separated string format assumed in the previous implementation (`input_str.strip().split()`). The core logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it right by two positions seems correct based on the initial analysis and the example outputs. The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input, removing the string parsing steps.

*   **Metrics Gathering:**
    The core transformation logic involves:
    1.  Identifying the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-zero identical numbers.
    2.  Calculating the new start and end indices by adding 2 to the original indices.
    3.  Constructing the output array with the block placed at the new indices, padded with zeros.

    Let's verify this logic for each example assuming the input is already a list/array:

    *   **Example 1:** Input `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` at indices `[0, 5)`. Shifted indices `[2, 7)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.
    *   **Example 2:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[9]` at indices `[5, 6)`. Shifted indices `[7, 8)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.
    *   **Example 3:** Input `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` at indices `[0, 5)`. Shifted indices `[2, 7)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.
    *   **Example 4:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` at indices `[3, 8)`. Shifted indices `[5, 10)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]`. Matches.
    *   **Example 5:** Input `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[5, 5, 5, 5]` at indices `[2, 6)`. Shifted indices `[4, 8)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.
    *   **Example 6:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[1]` at indices `[4, 5)`. Shifted indices `[6, 7)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.
    *   **Example 7:** Input `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` at indices `[1, 6)`. Shifted indices `[3, 8)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.

    The analysis confirms the transformation rule (shift right by 2) is consistent across all examples. The implementation error was purely related to input data type handling.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
    2.  Determine the length `n` of the input sequence (which is 12 in the examples).
    3.  Locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence. Record its starting index (`start_index`), ending index (`end_index`), and the value (`block_value`) of the integers in the block.
    4.  If no such block is found (e.g., the sequence contains only zeros), return a sequence of `n` zeros.
    5.  Create a new output sequence of length `n`, initially filled with zeros.
    6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block: `new_start_index = start_index + 2`.
    7.  Calculate the new ending index for the block: `new_end_index = end_index + 2`.
    8.  Iterate from `new_start_index` up to (but not including) `new_end_index`. For each index `i` in this range:
        *   If `i` is less than `n` (i.e., within the bounds of the output sequence), set the element at index `i` in the output sequence to `block_value`.
    9.  Return the resulting output sequence.
