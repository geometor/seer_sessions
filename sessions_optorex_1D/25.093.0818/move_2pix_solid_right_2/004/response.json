            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: finding a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shifting it two positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence (12 elements), padding with zeros. However, the provided code execution results indicate a fundamental failure in the implementation or its interaction with the testing environment. The output was consistently '0' for all inputs, suggesting either an error in parsing the input string, constructing the output string, or a logical flaw that resulted in an empty or zero-only list before final formatting.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-verify the core logic against all examples.\n2.  Focus on the implementation details, particularly input parsing and output formatting to ensure a space-separated string of 12 integers is produced.\n3.  Refine the `find_non_zero_block` logic if necessary, although it appears conceptually correct.\n4.  Ensure the shifting logic correctly handles indices and list boundaries.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nLet's analyze the block characteristics and shift for each example:\n\n*   **train_1:** Input block: `5`s, length 5, start index 0. Output block starts at index 2. Shift = +2.\n*   **train_2:** Input block: `9`, length 1, start index 5. Output block starts at index 7. Shift = +2.\n*   **train_3:** Input block: `6`s, length 5, start index 0. Output block starts at index 2. Shift = +2.\n*   **train_4:** Input block: `6`s, length 5, start index 3. Output block starts at index 5. Shift = +2.\n*   **train_5:** Input block: `5`s, length 4, start index 2. Output block starts at index 4. Shift = +2.\n*   **train_6:** Input block: `1`, length 1, start index 4. Output block starts at index 6. Shift = +2.\n*   **train_7:** Input block: `6`s, length 5, start index 1. Output block starts at index 3. Shift = +2.\n*   **test_1:** Input block: `7`, length 1, start index 2. Output block starts at index 4. Shift = +2.\n\nThe pattern holds consistently across all examples: The contiguous block of non-zero identical integers is shifted exactly 2 positions to the right.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
