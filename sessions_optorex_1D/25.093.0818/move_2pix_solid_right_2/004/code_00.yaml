task_description: "Shifting a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers two positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence, padding with zeros."
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    properties:
      - length: 12 (constant)
      - content: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers.
  - name: block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    properties:
      - elements: identical non-zero integers (value and length vary per example)
      - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence.
  - name: zero
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: padding_element
action:
  name: shift_right
  target: block
  details:
    - amount: 2 positions (constant)
    - mechanism: The entire block moves two indices to the right relative to its input position.
    - fill_value: Zeros fill the positions not occupied by the shifted block.
relationship:
  - The start index of the block in the output sequence is exactly 2 greater than its start index in the input sequence.
  - The end index of the block in the output sequence is exactly 2 greater than its end index in the input sequence.
constraints:
  - The length of the sequence remains 12.
  - The value and length of the non-zero block remain unchanged.
  - There is only one such non-zero block in the input.
