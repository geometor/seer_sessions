*   **General Assessment:**
    The provided code failed because it was designed to handle space-separated string inputs (`input_str.strip().split()`), while the testing environment supplied NumPy arrays directly to the `transform` function. The core logic of identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical numbers and shifting it right by two positions appears consistent with the visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The strategy to resolve the errors involves modifying the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list) as input and return a list of integers as output, removing the string parsing/formatting steps. The helper function `find_non_zero_block` should also be robust enough to handle list or NumPy array inputs.

*   **Gather Metrics:**
    Based on the examples and error messages:
    *   **Input Type:** Consistently NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`).
    *   **Output Type:** Assumed to be a list or NumPy array based on typical testing frameworks for such tasks. The desired output format is a list of integers.
    *   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output in all examples.
    *   **Shift Amount:** The non-zero block consistently shifts 2 positions to the right.
    *   **Block Properties:** Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. The value and length of this block are preserved in the output.
    *   **Fill Value:** Positions not occupied by the shifted block in the output are filled with 0.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: "Shifting a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers two positions to the right within a sequence."
    input_type: numpy.ndarray
    output_type: list_of_integers
    elements:
      - name: sequence
        type: numpy.ndarray
        properties:
          - dtype: integer
          - length: 12 (constant in examples)
          - contains: predominantly zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers
      - name: block
        type: contiguous_subsequence
        properties:
          - elements: identical non-zero integers
          - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence
      - name: zero
        type: integer
        value: 0
    action:
      name: shift_right
      target: block
      details:
        - amount: 2 positions (fixed)
        - mechanism: The entire block is copied to a new position shifted two indices to the right relative to its original start index.
        - fill_value: The output sequence is initialized with zeros, and the block is placed at the shifted location.
    relationship:
      - The start index of the block in the output list is the start index in the input sequence plus 2.
      - The end index of the block in the output list is the end index in the input sequence plus 2.
    constraints:
      - The length of the sequence remains 12.
      - The values and the length of the non-zero block remain unchanged.
      - Input is guaranteed to contain exactly one such block.
      - Indices for the shifted block respect the bounds of the list (parts of the block shifting beyond the end are truncated).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Receive the input as a NumPy array of 12 integers.
    2.  Initialize a new output list of 12 integers, filled with zeros.
    3.  Iterate through the input array to find the first occurrence of a non-zero integer. Record its index as `start_index` and its value as `block_value`.
    4.  Continue iterating from `start_index` until either the end of the array is reached, a zero is encountered, or an integer different from `block_value` is found. Record the index where the block ends as `end_index` (exclusive).
    5.  Calculate the `new_start_index` by adding 2 to the original `start_index`.
    6.  Calculate the `new_end_index` by adding 2 to the original `end_index`.
    7.  Iterate from `new_start_index` up to (but not including) `new_end_index`. For each index `i` in this range:
        a.  Check if `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the output list (0 to 11).
        b.  If it is a valid index, set the element at `output_list[i]` to `block_value`.
    8.  Return the final output list.
