            "text": "*   **General Assessment:**\n    The provided code failed because it was designed to handle space-separated string inputs (`input_str.strip().split()`), while the testing environment supplied NumPy arrays directly to the `transform` function. The core logic of identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical numbers and shifting it right by two positions appears consistent with the visual inspection of the input/output pairs. The strategy to resolve the errors involves modifying the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array (or a list) as input and return a list of integers as output, removing the string parsing/formatting steps. The helper function `find_non_zero_block` should also be robust enough to handle list or NumPy array inputs.\n\n*   **Gather Metrics:**\n    Based on the examples and error messages:\n    *   **Input Type:** Consistently NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`).\n    *   **Output Type:** Assumed to be a list or NumPy array based on typical testing frameworks for such tasks. The desired output format is a list of integers.\n    *   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 for both input and output in all examples.\n    *   **Shift Amount:** The non-zero block consistently shifts 2 positions to the right.\n    *   **Block Properties:** Each input contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. The value and length of this block are preserved in the output.\n    *   **Fill Value:** Positions not occupied by the shifted block in the output are filled with 0.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
