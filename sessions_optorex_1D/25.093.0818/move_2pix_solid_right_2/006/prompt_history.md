Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   Each input and output is a sequence (list) of integers.
    *   The length of the sequence appears constant across all examples (12 elements).
    *   The sequences contain predominantly zeros (0).
    *   Each sequence also contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`, `9`, `6 6 6 6 6`, `1`).
    *   The transformation involves changing the positions of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the block of non-zero numbers moves.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_description: "Shifting a contiguous block of non-zero integers within a list."
    elements:
      - name: list
        type: sequence_of_integers
        properties:
          - length: 12 (constant in examples)
          - contains: primarily zeros and one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers
      - name: block
        type: contiguous_subsequence
        properties:
          - elements: identical non-zero integers
          - location: defined by start and end index within the list
      - name: zero
        type: integer
        value: 0
    action:
      name: shift_right
      target: block
      details:
        - amount: 2 positions
        - mechanism: The entire block moves two indices to the right.
        - fill_value: Zeros fill the positions originally occupied by the block (unless overwritten by the shifted block itself) and any remaining positions.
    relationship:
      - The position of the block in the output list is determined by its position in the input list plus the shift amount.
    constraints:
      - The length of the list remains unchanged.
      - The values and the length of the non-zero block remain unchanged.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Identify the input sequence of 12 integers.
    2.  Locate the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence. Determine its starting index and ending index.
    3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 integers, initially filled with zeros.
    4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to its original starting index.
    5.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 2 to its original ending index.
    6.  Copy the original block of non-zero integers into the output sequence, starting at the calculated new starting index and ending at the calculated new ending index.
    7.  Return the resulting output sequence.
