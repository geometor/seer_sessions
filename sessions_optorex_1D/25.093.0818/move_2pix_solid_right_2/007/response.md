"""
Identifies a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within a sequence (list or NumPy array) of integers and shifts this block exactly two positions to the right. The output sequence maintains the same length as the input, filling positions not occupied by the shifted block with zeros. The input is a NumPy array, and the output is a list of integers.
