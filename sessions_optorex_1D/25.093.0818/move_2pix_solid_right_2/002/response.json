This indicates that the `transform` function received input data as a NumPy array, not the expected space-separated string format assumed in the previous implementation (`input_str.strip().split()`). The core logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it right by two positions seems correct based on the initial analysis and the example outputs. The strategy is to modify the `transform` function to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers as input, removing the string parsing steps.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering:**\n    The core transformation logic involves:\n    1.  Identifying the start and end indices of the contiguous block of non-zero identical numbers.\n    2.  Calculating the new start and end indices by adding 2 to the original indices.\n    3.  Constructing the output array with the block placed at the new indices, padded with zeros.\n\n    Let's verify this logic for each example assuming the input is already a list/array:\n\n    *   **Example 1:** Input `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` at indices `[0, 5)`. Shifted indices `[2, 7)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[9]` at indices `[5, 6)`. Shifted indices `[7, 8)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n    *   **Example 3:** Input `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` at indices `[0, 5)`. Shifted indices `[2, 7)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n    *   **Example 4:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` at indices `[3, 8)`. Shifted indices `[5, 10)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n    *   **Example 5:** Input `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[5, 5, 5, 5]` at indices `[2, 6)`. Shifted indices `[4, 8)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n    *   **Example 6:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[1]` at indices `[4, 5)`. Shifted indices `[6, 7)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n    *   **Example 7:** Input `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` at indices `[1, 6)`. Shifted indices `[3, 8)`. Expected Output `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n\n    The analysis confirms the transformation rule (shift right by 2) is consistent across all examples. The implementation error was purely related to input data type handling.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
