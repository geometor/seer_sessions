Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation.

*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   Each input and output is a sequence (list) of integers.
    *   The length of the sequence appears constant across all examples (12 elements).
    *   The sequences contain predominantly zeros (0).
    *   Each sequence also contains a contiguous block of identical non-zero integers (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`, `9`, `6 6 6 6 6`, `1`).
    *   The transformation involves changing the positions of the elements within the sequence. Specifically, the block of non-zero numbers moves.

*   **YAML Facts:**

**General Assessment:**

The previous analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: finding a contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shifting it two positions to the right within a fixed-length sequence (12 elements), padding with zeros. However, the provided code execution results indicate a fundamental failure in the implementation or its interaction with the testing environment. The output was consistently '0' for all inputs, suggesting either an error in parsing the input string, constructing the output string, or a logical flaw that resulted in an empty or zero-only list before final formatting.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-verify the core logic against all examples.
2.  Focus on the implementation details, particularly input parsing and output formatting to ensure a space-separated string of 12 integers is produced.
3.  Refine the `find_non_zero_block` logic if necessary, although it appears conceptually correct.
4.  Ensure the shifting logic correctly handles indices and list boundaries.

**Metrics:**

Let's analyze the block characteristics and shift for each example:

*   **train_1:** Input block: `5`s, length 5, start index 0. Output block starts at index 2. Shift = +2.
*   **train_2:** Input block: `9`, length 1, start index 5. Output block starts at index 7. Shift = +2.
*   **train_3:** Input block: `6`s, length 5, start index 0. Output block starts at index 2. Shift = +2.
*   **train_4:** Input block: `6`s, length 5, start index 3. Output block starts at index 5. Shift = +2.
*   **train_5:** Input block: `5`s, length 4, start index 2. Output block starts at index 4. Shift = +2.
*   **train_6:** Input block: `1`, length 1, start index 4. Output block starts at index 6. Shift = +2.
*   **train_7:** Input block: `6`s, length 5, start index 1. Output block starts at index 3. Shift = +2.
*   **test_1:** Input block: `7`, length 1, start index 2. Output block starts at index 4. Shift = +2.

The pattern holds consistently across all examples: The contiguous block of non-zero identical integers is shifted exactly 2 positions to the right.

  - The end index of the block in the output sequence is exactly 2 greater than its end index in the input sequence.

input_format: string (space-separated integers)
output_format: string (space-separated integers)

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a string containing 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string into a list of 12 integers.
3.  Initialize an output list of 12 integers, filled with zeros.
4.  Iterate through the input list to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the potential start of the block.
5.  Record the starting index and the value of this non-zero integer.
6.  Continue iterating from the starting index to find where the sequence of identical non-zero integers ends (either by encountering a different number, a zero, or the end of the list). Record the ending index (exclusive).
7.  If a non-zero block was found:
    *   Calculate the new starting index by adding 2 to the original starting index.
    *   Calculate the new ending index by adding 2 to the original ending index.
    *   Iterate from the new starting index up to (but not including) the new ending index. For each index `i` in this range:
        *   Check if `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the output list (0 to 11).
        *   If it is valid, set the element at index `i` in the output list to the recorded value of the block.
8.  Convert the output list of integers back into a string of space-separated integers.
9.  Return the resulting string.
