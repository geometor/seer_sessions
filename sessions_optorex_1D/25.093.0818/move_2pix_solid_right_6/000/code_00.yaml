Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements: Single-digit integers
  Representation: Space-separated string
Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Length: Constant (12 in all examples)
      - Elements: Integers (mostly 0, one non-zero value)
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Value: A single non-zero digit (e.g., 1, 4, 8, 9)
      - Structure: Contiguous sequence of the same non-zero digit
      - Location: Varies within the input sequence
  - Name: Background
    Properties:
      - Value: 0
      - Structure: Occupies positions not taken by the NonZeroBlock
Relationships:
  - The NonZeroBlock is embedded within the Background in the input sequence.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the NonZeroBlock in the input sequence.
  - Shift: Move the identified NonZeroBlock two positions to the right.
  - Replace: Fill the original positions of the NonZeroBlock with the Background value (0).
  - Update: Fill the new positions occupied by the shifted block with the NonZeroBlock's value.
  - Maintain: Keep the sequence length constant.
Transformation:
  Input_Sequence -> Shift(Identify(NonZeroBlock), right, 2) -> Output_Sequence
