            "text": "Okay, analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Perception of Elements:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of single-digit integers separated by spaces.\n*   **Sequence Structure:** The sequences primarily consist of the digit `0`, with a single contiguous block (or sometimes just one instance) of a non-zero digit (e.g., `4`, `1`, `9`, `8`).\n*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial shift of the non-zero block within the sequence.\n*   **Shift Characteristics:** The non-zero block consistently shifts exactly two positions to the right.\n*   **Background Filling:** The positions originally occupied by the non-zero block become `0`s in the output. The positions that were originally `0`s and are now occupied by the shifted block take the value of the non-zero digit.\n*   **Boundary Handling:** The shift occurs within the fixed length of the sequence. If the shift would extend beyond the sequence boundary, it appears truncated (though no examples explicitly show truncation, the rightmost elements are preserved within the original length).\n*   **Consistency:** The non-zero digit itself does not change value; only its position changes. The length of the sequence remains constant.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
