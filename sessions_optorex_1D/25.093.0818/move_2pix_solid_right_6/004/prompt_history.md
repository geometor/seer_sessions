Okay, analyzing the provided examples.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are strings representing sequences of single-digit integers separated by spaces.
*   **Sequence Structure:** The sequences primarily consist of the digit `0`, with a single contiguous block (or sometimes just one instance) of a non-zero digit (e.g., `4`, `1`, `9`, `8`).
*   **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial shift of the non-zero block within the sequence.
*   **Shift Characteristics:** The non-zero block consistently shifts exactly two positions to the right.
*   **Background Filling:** The positions originally occupied by the non-zero block become `0`s in the output. The positions that were originally `0`s and are now occupied by the shifted block take the value of the non-zero digit.
*   **Boundary Handling:** The shift occurs within the fixed length of the sequence. If the shift would extend beyond the sequence boundary, it appears truncated (though no examples explicitly show truncation, the rightmost elements are preserved within the original length).
*   **Consistency:** The non-zero digit itself does not change value; only its position changes. The length of the sequence remains constant.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements: Single-digit integers
  Representation: Space-separated string
Objects:
  - Name: Sequence
    Properties:
      - Length: Constant (12 in all examples)
      - Elements: Integers (mostly 0, one non-zero value)
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Value: A single non-zero digit (e.g., 1, 4, 8, 9)
      - Structure: Contiguous sequence of the same non-zero digit
      - Location: Varies within the input sequence
  - Name: Background
    Properties:
      - Value: 0
      - Structure: Occupies positions not taken by the NonZeroBlock
Relationships:
  - The NonZeroBlock is embedded within the Background in the input sequence.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the start and end indices of the NonZeroBlock in the input sequence.
  - Shift: Move the identified NonZeroBlock two positions to the right.
  - Replace: Fill the original positions of the NonZeroBlock with the Background value (0).
  - Update: Fill the new positions occupied by the shifted block with the NonZeroBlock's value.
  - Maintain: Keep the sequence length constant.
Transformation:
  Input_Sequence -> Shift(Identify(NonZeroBlock), right, 2) -> Output_Sequence
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Identify the single non-zero integer value present in the list.
3.  Find the starting index and the ending index of the contiguous block formed by this non-zero integer.
4.  Create a new list of the same length as the input list, initialized entirely with zeros.
5.  Calculate the new starting index by adding 2 to the original starting index.
6.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 2 to the original ending index.
7.  Iterate from the new starting index up to the new ending index (inclusive). For each index in this range, if the index is within the bounds of the list (i.e., less than the list length), set the element at that index in the new list to the identified non-zero integer value.
8.  Convert the new list of integers back into a space-separated string to form the output.
