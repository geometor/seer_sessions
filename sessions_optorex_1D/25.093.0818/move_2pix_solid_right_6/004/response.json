            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial code correctly identified the core transformation rule: shifting a contiguous block of a single non-zero digit two positions to the right within a sequence, replacing the original positions with zeros. However, it failed execution because it assumed the input `input_grid` was a 1D NumPy array (`shape=(N,)`), while the testing environment likely provides it as a 2D NumPy array with a single row (`shape=(1, N)`). This mismatch caused errors during indexing and type casting, specifically when interacting with the results of `np.where` and attempting to extract scalar values.\n\nThe strategy to resolve this is to modify the code to correctly handle the 2D, single-row input structure. This involves:\n1.  Adjusting the `_find_non_zero_block_indices` function to correctly interpret the two arrays returned by `np.where` on a 2D input (using the second array for column indices) and to correctly extract the non-zero value.\n2.  Adjusting the main `transform` function to use 2D indexing (e.g., `output_grid[0, col_index]`) when populating the shifted block in the output array.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe code execution analysis performed previously confirms the following:\n*   **Input Structure Assumption:** The code assumed a 1D array.\n*   **Actual Input Structure (Inferred):** The errors strongly indicate the `transform` function receives a 2D NumPy array of shape `(1, N)`, where N is the sequence length (12 in the examples).\n*   **Error Type:** `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`.\n*   **Error Cause:** Incorrect indexing after `np.where` on a 2D array, specifically `arr[non_zero_indices[0]]`, which results in a multi-element array being passed to `int()`. Also, the original `_find_non_zero_block_indices` would return incorrect start/end indices (using row indices instead of column indices). Subsequent writes in `transform` would also fail or be incorrect due to using 1D indexing on a 2D array.\n*   **Consistency:** All training examples failed with the same error, supporting the hypothesis of a consistent input structure mismatch.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
