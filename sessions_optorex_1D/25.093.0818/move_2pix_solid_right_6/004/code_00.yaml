Data:
  Type: Grid (2D NumPy array)
  Dimensions: 1 row, N columns (N=12 in examples)
  Elements: Integers
Objects:
  - Name: InputGrid
    Properties:
      - Shape: (1, N)
      - Data Type: Integer
      - Content: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous horizontal block of a single non-zero digit.
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Value: A single non-zero integer (e.g., 1, 4, 8, 9)
      - Structure: Contiguous horizontal sequence of the same non-zero digit within the single row.
      - Location: Defined by start and end column indices within the row.
  - Name: Background
    Properties:
      - Value: 0
      - Structure: Occupies grid cells not taken by the NonZeroBlock.
  - Name: OutputGrid
    Properties:
      - Shape: Same as InputGrid (1, N)
      - Data Type: Integer
      - Content: Initially all zeros, then populated with the shifted NonZeroBlock.
Relationships:
  - The NonZeroBlock exists within the single row of the InputGrid.
Actions:
  - Identify: Locate the non-zero value and the start/end column indices of the NonZeroBlock in the InputGrid's row.
  - Initialize: Create an OutputGrid of the same shape as the InputGrid, filled with the Background value (0).
  - Calculate Shift: Determine the new start and end column indices by adding 2 to the original start and end column indices.
  - Populate: For each column index from the new start index to the new end index (inclusive):
      - Check if the column index is within the bounds (0 to N-1).
      - If within bounds, set the value of the OutputGrid at row 0 and the current column index to the identified non-zero value.
Transformation:
  InputGrid -> Identify(NonZeroBlock: value, start_col, end_col) -> Initialize(OutputGrid) -> Calculate Shift(start_col, end_col) -> Populate(OutputGrid, value, new_start_col, new_end_col) -> OutputGrid
