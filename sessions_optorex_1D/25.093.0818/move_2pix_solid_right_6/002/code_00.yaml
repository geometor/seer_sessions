Data:
  Type: NumPy Array
  Elements: Integers
  Dimensionality: 1D
Objects:
  - Name: InputArray
    Properties:
      - Type: numpy.ndarray
      - Shape: (N,) where N is constant (12 in examples)
      - Dtype: Integer
      - Content: Contains mostly zeros and one contiguous block of a single non-zero integer.
  - Name: NonZeroBlock
    Properties:
      - Value: A single non-zero integer (constant within a given array).
      - Structure: Contiguous sequence within the InputArray.
      - Location: Defined by start and end indices.
  - Name: OutputArray
    Properties:
      - Type: numpy.ndarray
      - Shape: Same as InputArray (N,)
      - Dtype: Integer
      - Content: Zeros and the shifted NonZeroBlock.
Relationships:
  - The NonZeroBlock is a sub-sequence of the InputArray.
  - The OutputArray is derived from the InputArray by relocating the NonZeroBlock.
Actions:
  - Identify: Determine the non-zero value present in the InputArray.
  - Locate: Find the start and end indices of the NonZeroBlock within the InputArray.
  - Create: Initialize an OutputArray of the same shape and type as the InputArray, filled with zeros.
  - Calculate Shift: Determine the new start and end indices by adding 2 to the original indices.
  - Populate: Copy the NonZeroBlock's value into the OutputArray at the calculated shifted indices, respecting array bounds.
Transformation:
  InputArray -> Locate(NonZeroBlock) -> Create(OutputArray) -> Populate(OutputArray, Shift(NonZeroBlock, right, 2)) -> OutputArray
