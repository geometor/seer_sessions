            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe execution results clearly indicate a fundamental mismatch between the expected input type (string) in the `transform` function and the actual input type provided during testing (`numpy.ndarray`). The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurs because the first step in the Python code (`_parse_input`) attempts to call the `.split()` method, which exists for strings but not for NumPy arrays.\n\nThe core logic identified previously (find a contiguous block of a non-zero digit and shift it right by two positions) appears consistent across the examples. The strategy for resolving the errors is to modify the program to accept a NumPy array as input directly and use array manipulation techniques (like boolean indexing or `np.where`) to find the non-zero block and create the shifted output array.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe primary metric revealed by the error messages is the **Input Data Type**: `numpy.ndarray`.\n\nVisual inspection and analysis of the examples confirm the following:\n\n*   **Input/Output Structure:** All inputs and outputs are 1-dimensional NumPy arrays of integers.\n*   **Array Length:** All examples use arrays of length 12.\n*   **Content Pattern:** Each input array contains a single contiguous block of a specific non-zero integer, surrounded by zeros.\n*   **Transformation Pattern:** The non-zero block is shifted exactly 2 positions to the right in the output array. Positions vacated by the shift become 0. Positions overwritten by the shift take the non-zero value. Boundary conditions (shifting near the right end) maintain the array length.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
