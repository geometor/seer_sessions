            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe primary issue identified across all examples is a `TypeError` indicating that the `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method on an input object that does not support it (specifically, a NumPy array or similar sequence type, rather than the expected string). This suggests the function's input parsing logic is mismatched with the actual data type being passed during execution.\n\nThe core transformation logic \u2014 identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical digits and shifting it two positions to the right \u2014 appears consistent with the input/output pairs provided in the examples.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) directly as input, removing the string parsing step (`.split()`).\n2.  Ensure the helper function `find_non_zero_block` correctly handles this sequence input.\n3.  Maintain the core logic of finding the block's start and end indices, calculating the new indices by adding 2, and constructing the output sequence.\n4.  Ensure the output format matches the examples (a space-separated string).\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\n*   **Input Type:** The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` strongly suggests the input `input_sequence_str` was actually a NumPy array in the testing environment, not a string.\n*   **Shift Amount Verification:** A visual inspection confirms a consistent rightward shift of +2 positions for the non-zero block in all training examples:\n    *   Train 1: `6` at index 2 -> index 4 (+2)\n    *   Train 2: `6...6` starts at index 2 -> index 4 (+2)\n    *   Train 3: `77` starts at index 6 -> index 8 (+2)\n    *   Train 4: `888` starts at index 1 -> index 3 (+2)\n    *   Train 5: `88` starts at index 7 -> index 9 (+2)\n    *   Train 6: `99` starts at index 3 -> index 5 (+2)\n    *   Train 7: `7` at index 3 -> index 5 (+2)\n*   **Block Identification Logic:** The `find_non_zero_block` logic correctly identifies the start, end, and value of the single contiguous non-zero block based on the examples.\n*   **Output Construction Logic:** Creating a zero array and placing the block at the new shifted position is the correct approach.\n\n**YAML Facts**\n\n"
