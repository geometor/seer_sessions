task_description: Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits two positions to the right within a 1D sequence.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D list or array of integers
      - contains: elements
      - length: variable (12 in examples)
  - object: element
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0 or a single non-zero digit type per sequence (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9)
      - position: index within the sequence
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence
      - elements: all elements have the same non-zero value
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index
      - value: the specific non-zero digit comprising the block
actions:
  - action: identify_non_zero_block
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence (list/array)
    output: block_properties (value, start_index, end_index)
    description: Finds the first contiguous segment of identical non-zero digits. Returns (None, -1, -1) if no block exists.
  - action: shift_block_right
    actor: system
    input: block_properties
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 2
      - direction: right
    output: new_block_start_index
    description: Calculates the new starting position for the block by adding 2 to the original start index.
  - action: generate_output_sequence
    actor: system
    input:
      - input_sequence_length
      - original_block_properties
      - new_block_start_index
    output: output_sequence (list/array)
    description: Creates a new sequence of the same length, initially filled with zeros, then places the identified block (using its value and length) at the calculated new starting position. Overwrites existing zeros.
  - action: format_output
    actor: system
    input: output_sequence (list/array)
    output: output_string
    description: Converts the final sequence into a space-separated string.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence (list/array)
    to: output_string
    rule: The single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence is shifted exactly two positions to the right. The elements at the new block positions in the output sequence take the block's value, while all other positions are zero. The final output is formatted as a space-separated string.
