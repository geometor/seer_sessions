task_description: Shifting a block of non-zero digits within a 1D sequence.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D list of integers
      - contains: elements
      - length: fixed (appears to be 12 in examples)
  - object: element
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0 or a single non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9)
      - position: index within the sequence
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence
      - elements: all elements have the same non-zero value
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index
      - value: the specific non-zero digit comprising the block
actions:
  - action: identify_non_zero_block
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    output: block_properties (value, start_index, end_index)
    description: Finds the contiguous segment of non-zero identical digits.
  - action: shift_block
    actor: system
    input: block_properties
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 2 positions
      - direction: right
    output: new_block_start_index
    description: Calculates the new starting position for the block by adding the shift amount to the original start index.
  - action: generate_output
    actor: system
    input:
      - input_sequence_length
      - original_block_properties
      - new_block_start_index
    output: output_sequence
    description: Creates a new sequence of the same length, initially filled with zeros, then places the identified block at the calculated new position.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The single contiguous block of non-zero digits in the input sequence is shifted exactly two positions to the right to produce the output sequence. The positions originally occupied by the block become zeros, unless overwritten by the shifted block itself.
