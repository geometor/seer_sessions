Each input sequence contains mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of a non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9). The length of this non-zero block varies. The transformation consistently moves this block of non-zero digits to the right within the sequence. The specific non-zero digit itself doesn't seem to affect the transformation logic, only its position and extent. The background remains zeros. The amount of shift appears constant across all examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
