task_description: Shift the single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 1D sequence two positions to the right.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D list of integers (potentially received as NumPy array or string, needs conversion)
      - contains: elements
      - length: variable (12 in examples)
  - object: element
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0 or a single non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9)
      - position: index within the sequence (0-based)
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence
      - elements: all elements share the same non-zero value
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index
      - value: the non-zero integer comprising the block
      - uniqueness: Assumed to be the only such block in the sequence based on examples.
actions:
  - action: parse_input
    actor: system
    input: raw_input_sequence (string or array)
    output: input_list (list of integers)
    description: Converts the input representation into a standard Python list of integers.
  - action: identify_non_zero_block
    actor: system
    input: input_list
    output: block_properties (value, start_index, end_index)
    description: Finds the first contiguous segment of identical non-zero digits. Returns value=None if no block is found.
  - action: calculate_new_position
    actor: system
    input: block_properties
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 2
      - direction: right
    output: new_start_index
    description: Calculates the target starting position for the block by adding the shift amount (2) to the original start index.
  - action: generate_output
    actor: system
    input:
      - sequence_length
      - original_block_properties (value, start_index, end_index)
      - new_start_index
    output: output_list (list of integers)
    description: Creates a new list of the specified length, initially filled with zeros, then places the identified block (value and length derived from original properties) starting at the new_start_index. Ensures placement respects sequence boundaries.
  - action: format_output
    actor: system
    input: output_list
    output: output_string
    description: Converts the final list of integers into a space-separated string.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence is identified, and then effectively moved exactly two positions to the right to produce the output sequence. The output sequence is otherwise filled with zeros.
