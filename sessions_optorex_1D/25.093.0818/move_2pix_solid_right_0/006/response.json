            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code consistently fails across all training and test examples, producing `0` as the output instead of the expected transformed sequence. This indicates a critical failure, likely stemming from one of two areas:\n\n1.  **Input Processing:** The function might not be receiving or parsing the input sequences correctly within the testing environment. Although the code includes logic to handle string inputs, there might be an incompatibility with how the test harness provides the data.\n2.  **Output Formatting:** The function returns a space-separated string representation of the sequence (e.g., `\"0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"`). The testing framework appears to misinterpret this, potentially expecting a different format like a list or array of integers, and defaults to showing `0` or perhaps only the first character. The consistent `0` output strongly suggests the framework is not correctly parsing the returned string.\n\nThe core logic described in the previous Natural Language Program (identifying the block and shifting it right by two positions) appears consistent with the input/output examples. The immediate strategy is to modify the function to return the data in the format expected by the testing environment, which is most likely a list or array of integers rather than a formatted string.\n\n**Metrics Analysis:**\n\nThe results show a complete failure (`Match: False`) for every example. Key observations:\n\n*   **Transformed Output:** Consistently `0`. This is the most telling metric. It means the testing framework is not receiving or interpreting the intended sequence (`0 0 ...`).\n*   **Size Correct:** Consistently `False`. The output `0` does not have the same length as the expected sequence (which is 12 elements in all examples).\n*   **Color Palette Correct:** Consistently `True`. This is misleading. Since the only output recognized is `0`, and `0` is part of the expected palette, this metric passes vacuously.\n*   **Color Count Correct:** Consistently `False`. The output `0` does not contain the non-zero digits present in the expected output.\n\nThis analysis reinforces the conclusion that the primary issue is the mismatch between the function's string output format and the format expected by the testing harness.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
