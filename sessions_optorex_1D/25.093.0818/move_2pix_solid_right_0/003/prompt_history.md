**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of integers. Each input sequence contains mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of a non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9). The length of this non-zero block varies. The transformation consistently moves this block of non-zero digits to the right within the sequence. The specific non-zero digit itself doesn't seem to affect the transformation logic, only its position and extent. The background remains zeros. The amount of shift appears constant across all examples.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence with the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with zeros.
2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-zero digit. Record its value and its starting index.
3.  Continue scanning from the starting index to find the end of the contiguous block of this non-zero digit. Record the ending index.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index found in step 2.
5.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 2 to the original ending index found in step 3.
6.  Iterate from the new starting index to the new ending index (inclusive). For each position in this range within the output sequence, set its value to the non-zero digit value recorded in step 2.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The primary issue identified across all examples is a `TypeError` indicating that the `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method on an input object that does not support it (specifically, a NumPy array or similar sequence type, rather than the expected string). This suggests the function's input parsing logic is mismatched with the actual data type being passed during execution.

The core transformation logic — identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical digits and shifting it two positions to the right — appears consistent with the input/output pairs provided in the examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) directly as input, removing the string parsing step (`.split()`).
2.  Ensure the helper function `find_non_zero_block` correctly handles this sequence input.
3.  Maintain the core logic of finding the block's start and end indices, calculating the new indices by adding 2, and constructing the output sequence.
4.  Ensure the output format matches the examples (a space-separated string).

**Metrics and Verification**

*   **Input Type:** The error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` strongly suggests the input `input_sequence_str` was actually a NumPy array in the testing environment, not a string.
*   **Shift Amount Verification:** A visual inspection confirms a consistent rightward shift of +2 positions for the non-zero block in all training examples:
    *   Train 1: `6` at index 2 -> index 4 (+2)
    *   Train 2: `6...6` starts at index 2 -> index 4 (+2)
    *   Train 3: `77` starts at index 6 -> index 8 (+2)
    *   Train 4: `888` starts at index 1 -> index 3 (+2)
    *   Train 5: `88` starts at index 7 -> index 9 (+2)
    *   Train 6: `99` starts at index 3 -> index 5 (+2)
    *   Train 7: `7` at index 3 -> index 5 (+2)
*   **Block Identification Logic:** The `find_non_zero_block` logic correctly identifies the start, end, and value of the single contiguous non-zero block based on the examples.
*   **Output Construction Logic:** Creating a zero array and placing the block at the new shifted position is the correct approach.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept the input sequence (as a list or array of integers).
2.  Determine the length of the input sequence.
3.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length, filled entirely with zeros.
4.  Scan the input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-zero digit. If found, record its value and its starting index. If no non-zero digit is found, skip to step 8.
5.  Continue scanning from the starting index to find the end of the contiguous block of this same non-zero digit. Record the ending index.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index.
7.  Iterate from the calculated new starting index for the length of the block (original end index - original start index + 1). For each position within this range *that is also within the bounds of the sequence length*, set the corresponding element in the output sequence to the recorded non-zero digit value.
8.  Convert the elements of the output sequence to strings.
9.  Join the string elements with single spaces to create the final output string.
10. Return the final output string.
