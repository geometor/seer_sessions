**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves transforming a one-dimensional sequence of integers. Each input sequence contains mostly zeros and a single contiguous block of a non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9). The length of this non-zero block varies. The transformation consistently moves this block of non-zero digits to the right within the sequence. The specific non-zero digit itself doesn't seem to affect the transformation logic, only its position and extent. The background remains zeros. The amount of shift appears constant across all examples.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Shifting a block of non-zero digits within a 1D sequence.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: 1D list of integers
      - contains: elements
      - length: fixed (appears to be 12 in examples)
  - object: element
    properties:
      - type: integer
      - value: 0 or a single non-zero digit (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9)
      - position: index within the sequence
  - object: block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sub-sequence
      - elements: all elements have the same non-zero value
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index
      - value: the specific non-zero digit comprising the block
actions:
  - action: identify_non_zero_block
    actor: system
    input: input_sequence
    output: block_properties (value, start_index, end_index)
    description: Finds the contiguous segment of non-zero identical digits.
  - action: shift_block
    actor: system
    input: block_properties
    parameters:
      - shift_amount: 2 positions
      - direction: right
    output: new_block_start_index
    description: Calculates the new starting position for the block by adding the shift amount to the original start index.
  - action: generate_output
    actor: system
    input:
      - input_sequence_length
      - original_block_properties
      - new_block_start_index
    output: output_sequence
    description: Creates a new sequence of the same length, initially filled with zeros, then places the identified block at the calculated new position.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence
    rule: The single contiguous block of non-zero digits in the input sequence is shifted exactly two positions to the right to produce the output sequence. The positions originally occupied by the block become zeros, unless overwritten by the shifted block itself.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence with the same length as the input sequence, filled entirely with zeros.
2.  Scan the input sequence to find the first occurrence of a non-zero digit. Record its value and its starting index.
3.  Continue scanning from the starting index to find the end of the contiguous block of this non-zero digit. Record the ending index.
4.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index found in step 2.
5.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 2 to the original ending index found in step 3.
6.  Iterate from the new starting index to the new ending index (inclusive). For each position in this range within the output sequence, set its value to the non-zero digit value recorded in step 2.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code consistently fails across all training and test examples, producing `0` as the output instead of the expected transformed sequence. This indicates a critical failure, likely stemming from one of two areas:

1.  **Input Processing:** The function might not be receiving or parsing the input sequences correctly within the testing environment. Although the code includes logic to handle string inputs, there might be an incompatibility with how the test harness provides the data.
2.  **Output Formatting:** The function returns a space-separated string representation of the sequence (e.g., `"0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"`). The testing framework appears to misinterpret this, potentially expecting a different format like a list or array of integers, and defaults to showing `0` or perhaps only the first character. The consistent `0` output strongly suggests the framework is not correctly parsing the returned string.

The core logic described in the previous Natural Language Program (identifying the block and shifting it right by two positions) appears consistent with the input/output examples. The immediate strategy is to modify the function to return the data in the format expected by the testing environment, which is most likely a list or array of integers rather than a formatted string.

**Metrics Analysis:**

The results show a complete failure (`Match: False`) for every example. Key observations:

*   **Transformed Output:** Consistently `0`. This is the most telling metric. It means the testing framework is not receiving or interpreting the intended sequence (`0 0 ...`).
*   **Size Correct:** Consistently `False`. The output `0` does not have the same length as the expected sequence (which is 12 elements in all examples).
*   **Color Palette Correct:** Consistently `True`. This is misleading. Since the only output recognized is `0`, and `0` is part of the expected palette, this metric passes vacuously.
*   **Color Count Correct:** Consistently `False`. The output `0` does not contain the non-zero digits present in the expected output.

This analysis reinforces the conclusion that the primary issue is the mismatch between the function's string output format and the format expected by the testing harness.

      - uniqueness: only one such block exists per input sequence in the examples
      - location: defined by start_index and end_index

    parameters:

    input:
      - input_sequence_length
      - original_block_properties (value, length)
      - new_block_start_index
    output: output_list (list of integers)
    description: Creates a new list of the same length as the input, initially filled with zeros, then places the identified block (using its value and length) at the calculated new starting position, respecting boundary conditions.
relationships:
  - type: transformation
    from: input_sequence
    to: output_sequence (as a list/array of integers)
    rule: The single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits in the input sequence is shifted exactly two positions to the right. The background remains zero. The output must be returned as a list or array of integers.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence. Ensure it is parsed into a list of integers, regardless of its original format (e.g., string, array). Let `N` be the length of the input list.
2.  Initialize an output list of length `N` with all elements set to 0.
3.  Scan the input list to find the first non-zero element. If no non-zero element is found, return the initialized output list (all zeros).
4.  Record the value of the first non-zero element (`block_value`) and its index (`start_index`).
5.  Continue scanning from `start_index + 1` to find the end of the contiguous block of `block_value`. Record the index of the last element belonging to the block as `end_index`. If the block consists of only one element, `end_index` will be equal to `start_index`.
6.  Calculate the new starting index for the block: `new_start_index = start_index + 2`.
7.  Calculate the length of the block: `block_length = end_index - start_index + 1`.
8.  Iterate `i` from 0 up to (but not including) `block_length`:
    *   Calculate the target index in the output list: `target_index = new_start_index + i`.
    *   Check if `target_index` is within the valid bounds of the output list (i.e., `0 <= target_index < N`).
    *   If it is within bounds, set the element at `output_list[target_index]` to `block_value`.
9.  Return the final `output_list` (as a list of integers).
