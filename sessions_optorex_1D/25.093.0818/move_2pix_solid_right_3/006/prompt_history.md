Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of space-separated integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the integer sequence remains constant between input and output for each example.
3.  **Key Components:** The non-zero integers appear to be the primary objects being manipulated. The zero integers ('0') seem to function as background or empty space.
4.  **Core Operation:** The transformation involves shifting a group of elements within the sequence.
5.  **Shift Target:** The group being shifted encompasses all elements from the first non-zero integer to the last non-zero integer found in the input sequence. This entire "block" (which might include zeroes if the non-zero numbers are not contiguous) is moved.
6.  **Shift Magnitude & Direction:** The identified block is consistently shifted two positions to the right.
7.  **Output Construction:** The output sequence is constructed by placing the shifted block into a sequence of zeroes of the same original length.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: space-separated integers
    elements: integers
    length_constraint: fixed between input and output

Objects:
  - name: integer_sequence
    type: list of integers
    source: input string
  - name: active_block
    type: sub-sequence
    definition: The portion of the input sequence starting from the index of the first non-zero integer and ending at the index of the last non-zero integer (inclusive).
    properties:
      - start_index_input: index of the first non-zero integer in the input.
      - end_index_input: index of the last non-zero integer in the input.
      - content: the sequence of integers within the block.
  - name: background_element
    type: integer
    value: 0
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence length
      - content: initially all zeroes, then populated with the shifted active_block.

Actions:
  - name: identify_active_block
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: active_block (including its start/end indices and content)
    condition: Requires at least one non-zero element in the input_sequence. If none exist, the transformation might result in an all-zero sequence or identity (though this case isn't shown).
  - name: calculate_target_position
    inputs: start_index_input
    outputs: start_index_output
    rule: start_index_output = start_index_input + 2
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - original_length
      - active_block_content
      - start_index_output
    outputs: output_sequence
    steps:
      - Create a list of zeroes with original_length.
      - Place active_block_content into this list starting at start_index_output.

Relationships:
  - The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by relocating the active_block.
  - The starting position of the active_block in the output is precisely 2 indices greater than its starting position in the input.
  - Elements in the output_sequence outside the bounds of the placed active_block are zeroes.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Determine the length of the list.
3.  Find the index of the first non-zero integer in the list (`first_nz_idx`). If no non-zero integers are present, create an output list of the original length filled entirely with zeroes and proceed to step 8.
4.  Find the index of the last non-zero integer in the list (`last_nz_idx`).
5.  Extract the sub-list (the "block") from the input list, starting at `first_nz_idx` and ending at `last_nz_idx` (inclusive).
6.  Create a new list of the original length, filled entirely with zeroes.
7.  Calculate the target starting index for the block in the new list: `target_start_idx = first_nz_idx + 2`. Place the extracted block into the new list, beginning at `target_start_idx`.
8.  Format the resulting list back into a string of space-separated integers for the final output.
