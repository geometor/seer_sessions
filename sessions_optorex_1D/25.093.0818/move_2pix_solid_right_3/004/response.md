**General Assessment:**

The provided execution results indicate that the `code_00.py` (NumPy version) failed to correctly implement the transformation logic, producing all-zero outputs for every input. However, a manual trace of the steps outlined in the previous Natural Language Program, when applied to each example (both train and test), yields the correct expected output.

This discrepancy suggests the core understanding of the transformation (identify the block from first to last non-zero element, shift it right by 2) is likely correct, but its implementation in the tested NumPy code was flawed. The string-based Python logic derived in the previous step appears sound and correctly handles all provided examples.

**Strategy:**

1.  Assume the Natural Language Program and the string-based implementation logic are correct, as they successfully predict the output for all examples.
2.  Re-evaluate the task based on this assumption, ensuring the description covers all nuances observed.
3.  Refine the Facts and Natural Language Program for clarity and completeness based on the consistent pattern across all examples.
4.  Document the metrics based on the *expected* transformation, not the failed code execution.
5.  Advise the coder phase to use or adapt the string-based logic or carefully debug the NumPy implementation, particularly the array slicing and assignment step (`output_grid[target_start_idx:target_end_idx] = active_block`).

**Metrics:**

Metrics gathered based on the *intended* transformation (shift block right by 2), which aligns with the expected outputs:

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: space-separated integers string
    elements: integers
    length_constraint: fixed between input and output (observed length 12 in examples)

Objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    source: input string parsed by space
  - name: active_block
    type: sub-sequence (list of integers)
    definition: The contiguous portion of the input_sequence starting from the index of the first non-zero integer and ending at the index of the last non-zero integer (inclusive). If no non-zero integers exist, this block is considered empty or non-existent for the purpose of transformation.
    properties:
      - start_index_input: index of the first non-zero integer in input_sequence. (-1 if none).
      - end_index_input: index of the last non-zero integer in input_sequence. (-1 if none).
      - content: the sequence of integers within the block.
      - length: number of elements in the block (end_index_input - start_index_input + 1).
  - name: background_element
    type: integer
    value: 0
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence length.
      - content: Constructed by placing the active_block at a shifted position within a list initially filled with background_elements.

Parameters:
  - name: shift_amount
    type: integer
    value: 2
    direction: right

Actions:
  - name: parse_input
    inputs: input_string
    outputs: input_sequence (list of integers), original_length
  - name: find_nonzero_indices
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: first_nz_idx, last_nz_idx
    description: Finds the indices of the first and last non-zero elements. Returns indicator values (e.g., -1) if no non-zero elements are found.
  - name: extract_active_block
    inputs: input_sequence, first_nz_idx, last_nz_idx
    outputs: active_block_content
    condition: Only if first_nz_idx is not -1.
  - name: initialize_output
    inputs: original_length, background_element
    outputs: output_sequence (initially all background_element)
  - name: calculate_target_position
    inputs: first_nz_idx, shift_amount
    outputs: target_start_idx
    rule: target_start_idx = first_nz_idx + shift_amount
  - name: place_block
    inputs: output_sequence, active_block_content, target_start_idx
    outputs: modified output_sequence
    description: Overwrites elements in output_sequence starting at target_start_idx with active_block_content. Assumes target placement is within bounds based on examples.
  - name: format_output
    inputs: output_sequence
    outputs: output_string (space-separated integers)

Edge Cases:
  - Input contains only zeroes: The output is identical to the input (no block to shift).

Relationships:
  - The output_sequence is a transformation of the input_sequence.
  - The active_block maintains its content and length but changes position.
  - The start position of the active_block in the output is shifted `shift_amount` (2) positions to the right relative to its start position in the input.
  - Elements outside the placed active_block in the output are background_elements (0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers, noting its `original_length`.
2.  Find the index of the first non-zero integer (`first_nz_idx`) and the last non-zero integer (`last_nz_idx`) in the list.
3.  If no non-zero integers are found (`first_nz_idx` is -1), create the output by formatting a list containing `original_length` zeroes back into a space-separated string, then terminate.
4.  Extract the sub-list (the "active block") from the input list, starting at `first_nz_idx` and ending at `last_nz_idx` (inclusive).
5.  Create a new list (`output_sequence`) of `original_length`, filled entirely with zeroes.
6.  Calculate the target starting index for placing the block in the `output_sequence`: `target_start_idx = first_nz_idx + 2`.
7.  Determine the target ending index: `target_end_idx = target_start_idx + length of active_block`.
8.  Place the `active_block` into the `output_sequence` by replacing the elements from `target_start_idx` up to (but not including) `target_end_idx` with the elements of the `active_block`.
9.  Format the `output_sequence` back into a string of space-separated integers for the final output.
