The zero integers ('0') seem to function as background or empty space.\n4.  **Core Operation:** The transformation involves shifting a group of elements within the sequence.\n5.  **Shift Target:** The group being shifted encompasses all elements from the first non-zero integer to the last non-zero integer found in the input sequence. This entire \"block\" (which might include zeroes if the non-zero numbers are not contiguous) is moved.\n6.  **Shift Magnitude & Direction:** The identified block is consistently shifted two positions to the right.\n7.  **Output Construction:** The output sequence is constructed by placing the shifted block into a sequence of zeroes of the same original length.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
