Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: space-separated integers
    elements: integers
    length_constraint: fixed between input and output

Objects:
  - name: integer_sequence
    type: list of integers
    source: input string
  - name: active_block
    type: sub-sequence
    definition: The portion of the input sequence starting from the index of the first non-zero integer and ending at the index of the last non-zero integer (inclusive).
    properties:
      - start_index_input: index of the first non-zero integer in the input.
      - end_index_input: index of the last non-zero integer in the input.
      - content: the sequence of integers within the block.
  - name: background_element
    type: integer
    value: 0
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - length: same as input_sequence length
      - content: initially all zeroes, then populated with the shifted active_block.

Actions:
  - name: identify_active_block
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: active_block (including its start/end indices and content)
    condition: Requires at least one non-zero element in the input_sequence. If none exist, the transformation might result in an all-zero sequence or identity (though this case isn't shown).
  - name: calculate_target_position
    inputs: start_index_input
    outputs: start_index_output
    rule: start_index_output = start_index_input + 2
  - name: construct_output
    inputs:
      - original_length
      - active_block_content
      - start_index_output
    outputs: output_sequence
    steps:
      - Create a list of zeroes with original_length.
      - Place active_block_content into this list starting at start_index_output.

Relationships:
  - The output_sequence is derived from the input_sequence by relocating the active_block.
  - The starting position of the active_block in the output is precisely 2 indices greater than its starting position in the input.
  - Elements in the output_sequence outside the bounds of the placed active_block are zeroes.
