Data:
  Type: Sequence (represented as string)
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Length: 12 elements
  Element_Type: Integer
Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Identifier: 0
    Role: Fills positions not occupied by the primary object.
  - Name: Block
    Identifier: Any non-zero integer (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4)
    Property: Appears as a single contiguous sequence of identical values within the input.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence (or none if input is all zeros).
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right
  Target: Block
  Parameter:
    Distance: 2 positions
  Effect:
    - The Block's intended starting and ending indices increase by 2.
    - A new sequence of 12 zeros is created.
    - The Block's value is placed into the new sequence at the calculated new indices, provided these indices are within the valid range [0, 11]. Elements that would shift beyond index 11 are discarded.
    - Positions originally occupied by the Block, but not by the shifted Block, remain 0 in the new sequence.
    - The sequence length remains 12.
Input_Output_Handling:
  Input: A single string containing 12 space-separated integers.
  Output: A single string containing 12 space-separated integers, representing the transformed sequence.
Relationships:
  - The Block is embedded within the Background in the input.
  - The transformation preserves the value of the Block, changes its position, and potentially reduces its length if shifted partially off the right boundary.
