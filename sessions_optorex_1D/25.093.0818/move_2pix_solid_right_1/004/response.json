            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided code consistently failed across all training examples, producing `[0]` instead of the shifted sequence. The test results indicate the input was provided as a string, but the code (specifically the second version presented, `code_00.py`) expected a list or NumPy array and returned a list. The test harness likely expected a string output formatted similarly to the input (space-separated integers).\n\nThe core logic for identifying the block and calculating the shift amount (2 positions to the right) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the examples. The primary issue seems to be the mismatch in data types between the function's input/output signature and the execution environment's expectations.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Use `tool_code` to run the `find_block` logic (from the second Python block provided in the previous turn, as it contains the reusable logic) on each training input to confirm it correctly identifies the block's value, start, and end indices.\n2.  **Confirm Shift Calculation:** Manually verify the shift calculation (`new_start = start + 2`, `new_end = end + 2`) and boundary handling for each example.\n3.  **Adapt Input/Output:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle space-separated string input (parsing it into a list) and produce space-separated string output (joining the resulting list). This aligns with the structure of the *first* Python block provided previously.\n4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML and Natural Language Program to reflect the string-based input/output format and ensure clarity on the transformation steps.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's verify the `find_block` function's behavior.\n\n"
