"""
Identifies a single contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within a 12-element input list/array.
Shifts this block 2 positions to the right.
Positions vacated by the block's original location become 0.
The sequence length remains 12; elements of the block that would be shifted beyond the right boundary (index 11) are discarded.
If the input contains no non-zero block (i.e., all zeros), the output is also all zeros.
