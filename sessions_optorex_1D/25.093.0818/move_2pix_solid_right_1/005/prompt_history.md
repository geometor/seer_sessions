Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
2.  **Content:** The sequences primarily contain the integer 0, representing empty or background positions.
3.  **Objects:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. This block represents the primary object of interest. The value of the non-zero integer varies across examples (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial shift or translation of the non-zero block within the sequence.
5.  **Shift Characteristics:**
    *   Direction: The shift is consistently to the right.
    *   Magnitude: The shift distance is always 2 positions.
    *   Boundary Handling: The sequence length remains fixed at 12. Elements shifted off the right end are presumably discarded (though no examples explicitly show this), and the positions vacated by the left end of the shifting block become 0.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Integer
Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Identifier: 0
    Role: Fills positions not occupied by the primary object.
  - Name: Block
    Identifier: Any non-zero integer (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4)
    Property: Appears as a single contiguous sequence of identical values within the input.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence.
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right
  Target: Block
  Parameter:
    Distance: 2 positions
  Effect:
    - The Block's starting and ending indices increase by 2.
    - Positions originally occupied by the Block, but not by the shifted Block, become Background (0).
    - The sequence length remains 12.
Relationships:
  - The Block is embedded within the Background.
  - The transformation preserves the value and length of the Block, only changing its position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero integers in the input sequence. Note its starting index, ending index, and the non-zero value.
2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Calculate the new starting index by adding 2 to the original starting index.
4.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 2 to the original ending index.
5.  Fill the positions in the output sequence from the new starting index up to and including the new ending index with the identified non-zero value.
6.  Return the resulting output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The provided code consistently failed across all training examples, producing `[0]` instead of the shifted sequence. The test results indicate the input was provided as a string, but the code (specifically the second version presented, `code_00.py`) expected a list or NumPy array and returned a list. The test harness likely expected a string output formatted similarly to the input (space-separated integers).

The core logic for identifying the block and calculating the shift amount (2 positions to the right) appears correct based on the initial analysis of the examples. The primary issue seems to be the mismatch in data types between the function's input/output signature and the execution environment's expectations.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Verify Core Logic:** Use `tool_code` to run the `find_block` logic (from the second Python block provided in the previous turn, as it contains the reusable logic) on each training input to confirm it correctly identifies the block's value, start, and end indices.
2.  **Confirm Shift Calculation:** Manually verify the shift calculation (`new_start = start + 2`, `new_end = end + 2`) and boundary handling for each example.
3.  **Adapt Input/Output:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle space-separated string input (parsing it into a list) and produce space-separated string output (joining the resulting list). This aligns with the structure of the *first* Python block provided previously.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML and Natural Language Program to reflect the string-based input/output format and ensure clarity on the transformation steps.

**Metrics Gathering:**

Let's verify the `find_block` function's behavior.

**Metric Analysis:**

The `find_block` function correctly identifies the non-zero block (value, start, end) in all training examples. The calculated new start and end indices also align with the expected outputs.

*   **train_1:** Block (8, 2, 3) -> New indices (4, 5). Output `0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0` (Correct)
*   **train_2:** Block (8, 2, 6) -> New indices (4, 8). Output `0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0` (Correct)
*   **train_3:** Block (7, 0, 5) -> New indices (2, 7). Output `0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0` (Correct)
*   **train_4:** Block (3, 1, 9) -> New indices (3, 11). Output `0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3` (Correct)
*   **train_5:** Block (4, 0, 4) -> New indices (2, 6). Output `0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0` (Correct)
*   **train_6:** Block (8, 9, 9) -> New indices (11, 11). Output `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8` (Correct)
*   **train_7:** Block (8, 3, 4) -> New indices (5, 6). Output `0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0` (Correct)

This confirms the core logic is sound. The failure observed previously was due to the input/output format mismatch.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence (represented as string)
  Format: Space-separated integers
  Length: 12 elements
  Element_Type: Integer
Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Identifier: 0
    Role: Fills positions not occupied by the primary object.
  - Name: Block
    Identifier: Any non-zero integer (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4)
    Property: Appears as a single contiguous sequence of identical values within the input.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence (or none if input is all zeros).
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right
  Target: Block
  Parameter:
    Distance: 2 positions
  Effect:
    - The Block's intended starting and ending indices increase by 2.
    - A new sequence of 12 zeros is created.
    - The Block's value is placed into the new sequence at the calculated new indices, provided these indices are within the valid range [0, 11]. Elements that would shift beyond index 11 are discarded.
    - Positions originally occupied by the Block, but not by the shifted Block, remain 0 in the new sequence.
    - The sequence length remains 12.
Input_Output_Handling:
  Input: A single string containing 12 space-separated integers.
  Output: A single string containing 12 space-separated integers, representing the transformed sequence.
Relationships:
  - The Block is embedded within the Background in the input.
  - The transformation preserves the value of the Block, changes its position, and potentially reduces its length if shifted partially off the right boundary.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input as a single string containing 12 space-separated integers.
2.  Parse the input string into a list or array of 12 integers.
3.  Identify the contiguous block of identical, non-zero integers within the list. Record its value, starting index, and ending index. If no such block exists (input is all zeros), proceed to step 7.
4.  Create a new list of 12 zeros, representing the initial state of the output sequence.
5.  Calculate the new starting index for the block by adding 2 to the original starting index.
6.  Calculate the new ending index for the block by adding 2 to the original ending index.
7.  Iterate from the calculated new starting index up to the calculated new ending index (inclusive). For each index in this range:
    *   Check if the index is within the valid bounds of the output list (0 to 11).
    *   If it is within bounds, set the element at that index in the output list to the recorded block value.
8.  Join the elements of the resulting output list into a single string, separated by spaces.
9.  Return the resulting string.
