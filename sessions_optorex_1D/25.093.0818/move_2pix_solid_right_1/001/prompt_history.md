Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and describe the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of 12 integers.
2.  **Content:** The sequences primarily contain the integer 0, representing empty or background positions.
3.  **Objects:** Each input sequence contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero integers. This block represents the primary object of interest. The value of the non-zero integer varies across examples (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4).
4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial shift or translation of the non-zero block within the sequence.
5.  **Shift Characteristics:**
    *   Direction: The shift is consistently to the right.
    *   Magnitude: The shift distance is always 2 positions.
    *   Boundary Handling: The sequence length remains fixed at 12. Elements shifted off the right end are presumably discarded (though no examples explicitly show this), and the positions vacated by the left end of the shifting block become 0.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Integer
Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Identifier: 0
    Role: Fills positions not occupied by the primary object.
  - Name: Block
    Identifier: Any non-zero integer (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4)
    Property: Appears as a single contiguous sequence of identical values within the input.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence.
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right
  Target: Block
  Parameter:
    Distance: 2 positions
  Effect:
    - The Block's starting and ending indices increase by 2.
    - Positions originally occupied by the Block, but not by the shifted Block, become Background (0).
    - The sequence length remains 12.
Relationships:
  - The Block is embedded within the Background.
  - The transformation preserves the value and length of the Block, only changing its position.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Identify the contiguous block of non-zero integers in the input sequence. Note its starting index, ending index, and the non-zero value.
2.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
3.  Calculate the new starting index by adding 2 to the original starting index.
4.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 2 to the original ending index.
5.  Fill the positions in the output sequence from the new starting index up to and including the new ending index with the identified non-zero value.
6.  Return the resulting output sequence.
