            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed execution because it was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, while the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch.\n\nThe strategy for resolving this is straightforward: modify the `transform` function signature and implementation to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers, eliminating the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`). The underlying logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it appears consistent with the examples observed initially and needs to be preserved, but applied to the correct input data type. The `find_block` helper function already works with a list, so the main change is in `transform`.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe error occurred consistently across all 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the failure report.\n\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError`\n*   **Error Message:** `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`\n*   **Cause:** The `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method (intended for strings) on the input, which was a NumPy array.\n*   **Input Data Type (Observed):** NumPy array of integers.\n*   **Input Data Shape (Assumed from examples):** 1D array/sequence of length 12.\n\nNo further code execution is needed to analyze this specific error, as the type mismatch is evident from the error message itself.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
