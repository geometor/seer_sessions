**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed execution because it was designed to accept a space-separated string as input, while the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` clearly indicates this type mismatch.

The strategy for resolving this is straightforward: modify the `transform` function signature and implementation to directly accept a list or NumPy array of integers, eliminating the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`). The underlying logic of identifying the non-zero block and shifting it appears consistent with the examples observed initially and needs to be preserved, but applied to the correct input data type. The `find_block` helper function already works with a list, so the main change is in `transform`.

**Metrics:**

The error occurred consistently across all 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the failure report.

*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError`
*   **Error Message:** `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`
*   **Cause:** The `transform` function attempted to call the `.split()` method (intended for strings) on the input, which was a NumPy array.
*   **Input Data Type (Observed):** NumPy array of integers.
*   **Input Data Shape (Assumed from examples):** 1D array/sequence of length 12.

No further code execution is needed to analyze this specific error, as the type mismatch is evident from the error message itself.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence (List or NumPy array)
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Integer
Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Identifier: 0
    Role: Fills positions not occupied by the primary object.
  - Name: Block
    Identifier: Any non-zero integer (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4)
    Property: Appears as a single contiguous sequence of identical values within the input sequence.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence (based on examples).
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right
  Target: Block
  Parameter:
    Distance: 2 positions
  Effect:
    - The Block's constituent elements are moved 2 indices to the right.
    - A new output sequence of the same length (12) is created, initially filled with Background (0).
    - The shifted Block is placed into the output sequence.
    - Elements of the Block that would be shifted beyond the right boundary (index 11) are discarded.
    - Positions in the output sequence corresponding to the Block's original location are left as Background (0), unless overwritten by the shifted Block itself.
Relationships:
  - The Block is embedded within the Background in the input.
  - The transformation preserves the value and length of the Block, changing only its position relative to the sequence boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence (a list or array of 12 integers).
2.  Identify the contiguous block of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence. Record its value, starting index, and ending index. If no such block exists (input is all zeros), proceed to step 6 with an empty block definition.
3.  Create a new output sequence of 12 zeros.
4.  If a non-zero block was found:
    a.  Define a shift distance of 2 positions.
    b.  Iterate through the indices of the identified block in the *input* sequence (from start index to end index).
    c.  For each element within the block, calculate its target index in the *output* sequence by adding the shift distance (2) to its original index.
    d.  If the calculated target index is within the bounds of the output sequence (0 to 11 inclusive), place the block's non-zero value at that target index in the output sequence. Ignore elements whose target index falls outside these bounds.
5.  Return the resulting output sequence.
