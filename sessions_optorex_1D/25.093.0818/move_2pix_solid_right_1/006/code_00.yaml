Data:
  Type: Sequence (List or NumPy array)
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Integer
Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Identifier: 0
    Role: Fills positions not occupied by the primary object.
  - Name: Block
    Identifier: Any non-zero integer (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4)
    Property: Appears as a single contiguous sequence of identical values within the input sequence.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence (based on examples).
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right
  Target: Block
  Parameter:
    Distance: 2 positions
  Effect:
    - The Block's constituent elements are moved 2 indices to the right.
    - A new output sequence of the same length (12) is created, initially filled with Background (0).
    - The shifted Block is placed into the output sequence.
    - Elements of the Block that would be shifted beyond the right boundary (index 11) are discarded.
    - Positions in the output sequence corresponding to the Block's original location are left as Background (0), unless overwritten by the shifted Block itself.
Relationships:
  - The Block is embedded within the Background in the input.
  - The transformation preserves the value and length of the Block, changing only its position relative to the sequence boundaries.
