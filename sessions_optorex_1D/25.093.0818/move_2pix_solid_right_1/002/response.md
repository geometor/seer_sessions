**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed execution on all examples due to a type mismatch error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input (`input_str.split()`) but was called with a NumPy array during testing.

The underlying logic (identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical integers and shifting it right by two positions) appears consistent with the input/output pairs provided across all training examples.

The strategy for resolving the error is straightforward: modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array directly as input, removing the string parsing step (`.split()`). The core block identification and shifting logic should then be re-evaluated against the examples.

**Metrics Gathering:**

The error message itself provides the key metric: the input data type during testing was `numpy.ndarray`. Let's re-examine the examples to confirm the transformation pattern holds:

*   **Example 1:** Block `[8 8]` (len 2) at index 2 -> starts at index 4. Shift = +2.
*   **Example 2:** Block `[8 8 8 8 8]` (len 5) at index 2 -> starts at index 4. Shift = +2.
*   **Example 3:** Block `[7 7 7 7 7 7]` (len 6) at index 0 -> starts at index 2. Shift = +2.
*   **Example 4:** Block `[3 ... 3]` (len 9) at index 1 -> starts at index 3. Shift = +2.
*   **Example 5:** Block `[4 4 4 4 4]` (len 5) at index 0 -> starts at index 2. Shift = +2.
*   **Example 6:** Block `[8]` (len 1) at index 9 -> starts at index 11. Shift = +2.
*   **Example 7:** Block `[8 8]` (len 2) at index 3 -> starts at index 5. Shift = +2.

**Conclusion:** The pattern of identifying a single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shifting it exactly 2 positions to the right is consistent across all examples. The length and value of the block are preserved. The vacated positions become 0, and elements shifted beyond the array boundary (index 11) are lost.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Data:
  Type: Sequence/Array
  Format: List or NumPy array of integers
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Integer
Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Identifier: 0
    Role: Fills positions not occupied by the primary object.
  - Name: Block
    Identifier: Any non-zero integer (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4)
    Property: Appears as a single contiguous sequence of identical values within the input array.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence.
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right
  Target: Block
  Parameter:
    Distance: 2 positions
  Effect:
    - The Block's starting and ending indices increase by 2.
    - Positions originally occupied by the Block, but not by the shifted Block, become Background (0).
    - The array length remains 12.
    - Elements of the Block shifted beyond index 11 are discarded.
Relationships:
  - The Block is embedded within the Background.
  - The transformation preserves the value and length of the Block, only changing its position relative to the array boundaries.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input as a list or array of 12 integers.
2.  Initialize a new output array of 12 zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input array to find the first non-zero integer. This marks the start of the `Block`. Record its value and starting index.
4.  Continue iterating from the start index to find the end of the contiguous sequence of the same non-zero value. Record the ending index. If no non-zero block is found, return the array of zeros.
5.  Calculate the new starting index by adding 2 to the original starting index.
6.  Calculate the new ending index by adding 2 to the original ending index.
7.  Iterate from the new starting index up to and including the new ending index. For each index `i` in this range:
    *   Check if `i` is within the bounds of the output array (0 <= `i` < 12).
    *   If it is within bounds, set the element at index `i` in the output array to the recorded value of the `Block`.
8.  Return the resulting output array.
