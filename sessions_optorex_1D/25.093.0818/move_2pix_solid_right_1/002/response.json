            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided code failed execution on all examples due to a type mismatch error: `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input (`input_str.split()`) but was called with a NumPy array during testing.\n\nThe underlying logic (identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical integers and shifting it right by two positions) appears consistent with the input/output pairs provided across all training examples.\n\nThe strategy for resolving the error is straightforward: modify the `transform` function to accept a list or NumPy array directly as input, removing the string parsing step (`.split()`). The core block identification and shifting logic should then be re-evaluated against the examples.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nThe error message itself provides the key metric: the input data type during testing was `numpy.ndarray`. Let's re-examine the examples to confirm the transformation pattern holds:\n\n*   **Example 1:** Block `[8 8]` (len 2) at index 2 -> starts at index 4. Shift = +2.\n*   **Example 2:** Block `[8 8 8 8 8]` (len 5) at index 2 -> starts at index 4. Shift = +2.\n*   **Example 3:** Block `[7 7 7 7 7 7]` (len 6) at index 0 -> starts at index 2. Shift = +2.\n*   **Example 4:** Block `[3 ... 3]` (len 9) at index 1 -> starts at index 3. Shift = +2.\n*   **Example 5:** Block `[4 4 4 4 4]` (len 5) at index 0 -> starts at index 2. Shift = +2.\n*   **Example 6:** Block `[8]` (len 1) at index 9 -> starts at index 11. Shift = +2.\n*   **Example 7:** Block `[8 8]` (len 2) at index 3 -> starts at index 5. Shift = +2.\n\n**Conclusion:** The pattern of identifying a single contiguous block of identical non-zero numbers and shifting it exactly 2 positions to the right is consistent across all examples. The length and value of the block are preserved. The vacated positions become 0, and elements shifted beyond the array boundary (index 11) are lost.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
