This block represents the primary object of interest. The value of the non-zero integer varies across examples (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4).\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to be a spatial shift or translation of the non-zero block within the sequence.\n5.  **Shift Characteristics:**\n    *   Direction: The shift is consistently to the right.\n    *   Magnitude: The shift distance is always 2 positions.\n    *   Boundary Handling: The sequence length remains fixed at 12. Elements shifted off the right end are presumably discarded (though no examples explicitly show this), and the positions vacated by the left end of the shifting block become 0.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
