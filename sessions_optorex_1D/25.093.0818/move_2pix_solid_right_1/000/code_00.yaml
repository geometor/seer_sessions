Data:
  Type: Sequence
  Length: 12
  Element_Type: Integer
Objects:
  - Name: Background
    Identifier: 0
    Role: Fills positions not occupied by the primary object.
  - Name: Block
    Identifier: Any non-zero integer (e.g., 8, 7, 3, 4)
    Property: Appears as a single contiguous sequence of identical values within the input.
    Cardinality: Exactly one per input sequence.
Action:
  Name: Shift_Right
  Target: Block
  Parameter:
    Distance: 2 positions
  Effect:
    - The Block's starting and ending indices increase by 2.
    - Positions originally occupied by the Block, but not by the shifted Block, become Background (0).
    - The sequence length remains 12.
Relationships:
  - The Block is embedded within the Background.
  - The transformation preserves the value and length of the Block, only changing its position.
