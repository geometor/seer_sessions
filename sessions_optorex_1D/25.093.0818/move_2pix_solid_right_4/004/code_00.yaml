task_description: "Shift a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits within a 1D sequence two positions to the right."
input_output_structure:
  - input: 1D sequence (array or list) of 12 integers.
  - output: 1D sequence (array or list) of 12 integers.
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_integers
    length: 12
    dimensionality: 1D # Explicitly state 1D
    properties:
      - primarily composed of zeros (background value).
      - contains exactly one contiguous block of identical non-zero digits.
  - name: zero
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: background filler / default value
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: sub-sequence_of_integers
    properties:
      - contains identical digits (value > 0).
      - digits are contiguous within the main sequence.
      - variable length (observed: 1, 2, or 3).
      - variable digit value (observed: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9).
    location:
      - defined by start_index and end_index in the input sequence.
action:
  - name: shift_right
    target: non_zero_block
    parameter:
      - distance: 2 positions
    details:
      - The block retains its original length and digit value.
      - The original positions occupied by the block become zeros.
      - The new positions are filled with the block's digit value.
transformation_rule:
  - Identify the start index, end index, length, and value of the non_zero_block in the input 1D sequence.
  - If no such block exists, return a sequence of all zeros.
  - Create a new 1D sequence of the same length (12), initialized with zeros.
  - Calculate the new start index by adding 2 to the original start index.
  - Calculate the new end index by adding 2 to the original end index.
  - Check if the new block position (new_start_index to new_end_index) is within the bounds of the sequence (0 to 11).
  - If within bounds, place the non_zero_block (using its value and length) into the new sequence at the calculated new start index.
  - Return the new sequence.
notes:
  - Potential issue: The testing environment might provide input as a 2D array (e.g., shape (1, 12)). The transformation logic should ideally handle this by flattening the input to 1D.
