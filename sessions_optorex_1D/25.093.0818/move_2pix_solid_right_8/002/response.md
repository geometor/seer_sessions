**General Assessment**

The provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule where non-zero integer elements within a 1D sequence are shifted two positions to the right. The sequence length is fixed at 12. Positions vacated by the shifted elements become zero, and elements shifted beyond the right boundary (index 11) are effectively removed. The background is represented by the integer 0.

The errors reported ("ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") during the execution of the previous Python code suggest an issue with how the input data was handled or passed to the `transform` function during testing, likely a data type mismatch (e.g., expecting a single number but receiving a list/array). The core logic derived from the examples—shifting non-zero elements right by two positions—appears correct and consistent across all provided training cases.

The strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule based on the consistent visual evidence in the examples and refine the natural language program for maximum clarity, explicitly stating the handling of 1D integer sequences. The underlying Python implementation should ideally handle standard Python lists of integers, which seems consistent with the problem description.

**Metrics**

No code execution is required for metric gathering as the pattern is directly observable and consistent across all examples:

*   **Input/Output Type:** 1D sequence (list or array) of integers.
*   **Sequence Length:** 12 (consistent).
*   **Element Types:** Integers (0 for background, non-zero for foreground elements).
*   **Transformation:** Spatial shift.
*   **Shift Direction:** Right.
*   **Shift Magnitude:** 2 positions.
*   **Boundary Handling:** Elements shifted past index 11 are dropped. Vacated positions become 0.
*   **Consistency:** The rule applies uniformly to all 7 training examples, whether the non-zero element is single or part of a contiguous block.

**Facts**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: 1D list of integers
    length: 12
Objects:
  - object: background_cell
    representation: integer 0
    role: occupies empty space
  - object: element_cell
    representation: non-zero integer (value preserved during transformation)
    properties:
      - value: the specific integer (e.g., 6, 5, 8, 2, 3, 4)
      - position: original index within the input list (0-11)
Relationships:
  - relationship: spatial arrangement
    description: Elements (zero and non-zero) are ordered sequentially in a list. Non-zero elements can be isolated or form contiguous blocks.
Action:
  - name: shift_right
    target: all element_cells (non-zero integers)
    parameter:
      - name: distance
        value: 2
    effect: Changes the position (index) of each non-zero element by adding 2 to its original index.
    constraints:
      - The shift only applies if the target index (original_index + 2) is within the list bounds (less than 12).
    consequence: Positions in the output list corresponding to the original positions of shifted non-zero elements become background_cells (0), unless occupied by another element shifted into that position (which is not possible with a uniform right shift). All positions in the output list that do not receive a shifted non-zero element are background_cells (0).
Transformation:
  - type: element-wise positional shift
  - description: Create a new list of the same size, initialized with zeros. For each non-zero element in the input list located at index `i`, place its value into the new list at index `i + 2`, provided `i + 2` is less than the list length (12).
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept a 1D input list of 12 integers.
2.  Create a new output list of 12 integers, initially filled with zeros.
3.  Iterate through the input list, examining each element and its index `i` (from 0 to 11).
4.  If the element at index `i` in the input list is not zero:
    a.  Calculate the target index `t = i + 2`.
    b.  Check if the target index `t` is less than 12 (i.e., within the bounds of the list).
    c.  If `t` is less than 12, place the value of the non-zero element from the input list (at index `i`) into the output list at index `t`.
5.  Return the completed output list.
