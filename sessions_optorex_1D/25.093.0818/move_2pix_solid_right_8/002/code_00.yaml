Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: 1D list of integers
    length: 12
Objects:
  - object: background_cell
    representation: integer 0
    role: occupies empty space
  - object: element_cell
    representation: non-zero integer (value preserved during transformation)
    properties:
      - value: the specific integer (e.g., 6, 5, 8, 2, 3, 4)
      - position: original index within the input list (0-11)
Relationships:
  - relationship: spatial arrangement
    description: Elements (zero and non-zero) are ordered sequentially in a list. Non-zero elements can be isolated or form contiguous blocks.
Action:
  - name: shift_right
    target: all element_cells (non-zero integers)
    parameter:
      - name: distance
        value: 2
    effect: Changes the position (index) of each non-zero element by adding 2 to its original index.
    constraints:
      - The shift only applies if the target index (original_index + 2) is within the list bounds (less than 12).
    consequence: Positions in the output list corresponding to the original positions of shifted non-zero elements become background_cells (0), unless occupied by another element shifted into that position (which is not possible with a uniform right shift). All positions in the output list that do not receive a shifted non-zero element are background_cells (0).
Transformation:
  - type: element-wise positional shift
  - description: Create a new list of the same size, initialized with zeros. For each non-zero element in the input list located at index `i`, place its value into the new list at index `i + 2`, provided `i + 2` is less than the list length (12).
