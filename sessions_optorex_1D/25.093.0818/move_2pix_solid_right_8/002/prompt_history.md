**Perception:**

The input and output are one-dimensional sequences (arrays or lists) of integers, all of length 12. The sequences primarily consist of the number 0, which appears to represent a background or empty state. Embedded within this background are one or more non-zero integers. In most examples, these non-zero integers form a single contiguous block, but sometimes there's only a single non-zero integer. The core transformation observed is a spatial shift of these non-zero integers to the right within the sequence. The magnitude of the shift is consistently 2 positions. The values of the non-zero integers themselves remain unchanged. The positions previously occupied by the shifted non-zero integers become 0 in the output.

**Facts:**


```yaml
Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: 1D array of integers
    length: 12
Objects:
  - object: background
    representation: integer 0
    role: fills empty positions
  - object: element
    representation: non-zero integer (e.g., 6, 5, 8, 2, 3, 4)
    properties:
      - value: the integer itself
      - position: index within the sequence
    grouping: can appear singly or as a contiguous block
Relationships:
  - relationship: relative position
    description: non-zero elements are located relative to the background (0s) and potentially each other (in blocks)
Action:
  - name: shift
    target: non-zero elements (or blocks of non-zero elements)
    direction: right
    magnitude: 2 positions
    effect: changes the position index of non-zero elements
    consequence: positions vacated by shifted elements become 0
Transformation:
  - type: positional shift
  - description: Moves all non-zero elements two positions to the right within the sequence boundary.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence of the same length as the input sequence, filled with zeros.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence from left to right (index `i` from 0 to length-3).
3.  For each element at index `i` in the input sequence:
    a.  If the element is non-zero, place this element's value into the output sequence at index `i + 2`.
4.  Return the modified output sequence.

import numpy as np

def transform(input_list):
    """
    Shifts all non-zero elements in a 1D list two positions to the right.

    Args:
      input_list: A list of integers.

    Returns:
      A new list of integers with non-zero elements shifted right by 2 positions.

    # Get the length of the input list
    n = len(input_list)

    # Initialize an output list of the same length, filled with zeros.
    output_list = [0] * n

    # Iterate through the input list
    # We only need to check up to index n-3 because elements at n-2 and n-1
    # would shift out of bounds if they were non-zero.
    for i in range(n):
        # Get the current element
        element = input_list[i]

        # Check if the element is non-zero
        if element != 0:
            # Calculate the target index for the shift
            target_index = i + 2

            # Check if the target index is within the bounds of the list
            if target_index < n:
                # Place the non-zero element into the output list at the shifted position
                output_list[target_index] = element

    # Return the modified output list
    return output_list
