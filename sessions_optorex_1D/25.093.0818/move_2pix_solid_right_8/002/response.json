            "text": "**General Assessment**\n\nThe provided examples consistently demonstrate a transformation rule where non-zero integer elements within a 1D sequence are shifted two positions to the right. The sequence length is fixed at 12. Positions vacated by the shifted elements become zero, and elements shifted beyond the right boundary (index 11) are effectively removed. The background is represented by the integer 0.\n\nThe errors reported (\"ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") during the execution of the previous Python code suggest an issue with how the input data was handled or passed to the `transform` function during testing, likely a data type mismatch (e.g., expecting a single number but receiving a list/array). The core logic derived from the examples\u2014shifting non-zero elements right by two positions\u2014appears correct and consistent across all provided training cases.\n\nThe strategy is to reaffirm the transformation rule based on the consistent visual evidence in the examples and refine the natural language program for maximum clarity, explicitly stating the handling of 1D integer sequences. The underlying Python implementation should ideally handle standard Python lists of integers, which seems consistent with the problem description.\n\n**Metrics**\n\nNo code execution is required for metric gathering as the pattern is directly observable and consistent across all examples:\n\n*   **Input/Output Type:** 1D sequence (list or array) of integers.\n*   **Sequence Length:** 12 (consistent).\n*   **Element Types:** Integers (0 for background, non-zero for foreground elements).\n*   **Transformation:** Spatial shift.\n*   **Shift Direction:** Right.\n*   **Shift Magnitude:** 2 positions.\n*   **Boundary Handling:** Elements shifted past index 11 are dropped. Vacated positions become 0.\n*   **Consistency:** The rule applies uniformly to all 7 training examples, whether the non-zero element is single or part of a contiguous block.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
