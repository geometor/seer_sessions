Data:
  - type: sequence
    format: 1D array of integers
    length: 12
Objects:
  - object: background
    representation: integer 0
    role: fills empty positions
  - object: element
    representation: non-zero integer (e.g., 6, 5, 8, 2, 3, 4)
    properties:
      - value: the integer itself
      - position: index within the sequence
    grouping: can appear singly or as a contiguous block
Relationships:
  - relationship: relative position
    description: non-zero elements are located relative to the background (0s) and potentially each other (in blocks)
Action:
  - name: shift
    target: non-zero elements (or blocks of non-zero elements)
    direction: right
    magnitude: 2 positions
    effect: changes the position index of non-zero elements
    consequence: positions vacated by shifted elements become 0
Transformation:
  - type: positional shift
  - description: Moves all non-zero elements two positions to the right within the sequence boundary.
