The sequences primarily consist of the number 0, which appears to represent a background or empty state. Embedded within this background are one or more non-zero integers. In most examples, these non-zero integers form a single contiguous block, but sometimes there's only a single non-zero integer. The core transformation observed is a spatial shift of these non-zero integers to the right within the sequence. The magnitude of the shift is consistently 2 positions. The values of the non-zero integers themselves remain unchanged. The positions previously occupied by the shifted non-zero integers become 0 in the output.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
