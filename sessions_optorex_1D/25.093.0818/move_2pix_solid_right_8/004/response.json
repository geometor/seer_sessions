            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (shifting non-zero elements two positions to the right) appears correct based on a visual inspection of all input/output pairs. The errors encountered during testing (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") strongly suggest a data type mismatch. Specifically, the `transform` function likely received a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, 12)`) instead of the assumed 1D list or array. When the code iterates through a 2D array like `[[0, 6, 0, ...]]`, the `element` in each step becomes the row (`[0, 6, 0, ...]`). Comparing this array directly to `0` (`if element != 0:`) triggers the error because Python doesn't know whether to evaluate the condition based on `any` or `all` elements of the resulting boolean array.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Acknowledge that the input is likely a 2D NumPy array with one row.\n2.  Modify the function to first extract the 1D array (the single row) from the input.\n3.  Apply the previously determined shifting logic to this 1D array.\n4.  Ensure the output format matches the expected output format (likely also a 1D structure, possibly presented as a 2D NumPy array with one row if that's the convention).\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nBased on the error analysis and tool execution:\n*   **Input Format Assumption:** Initially assumed 1D list or 1D NumPy array.\n*   **Actual Input Format (Inferred from Error):** 2D NumPy array, shape (1, N), where N is the sequence length (12 in examples).\n*   **Transformation Rule Consistency:** The rule \"shift non-zero elements right by 2 positions\" holds true for all 7 training examples.\n*   **Error Cause:** Applying a boolean check (`if element != 0:`) to an array resulting from iterating over a 2D NumPy array.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
