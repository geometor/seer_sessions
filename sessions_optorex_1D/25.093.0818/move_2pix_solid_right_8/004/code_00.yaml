Data:
  - type: sequence container
    format: 2D NumPy array, shape (1, 12)
    element_type: integer
Objects:
  - object: background
    representation: integer 0
    role: fills empty positions in the sequence
  - object: element
    representation: non-zero integer (e.g., 6, 5, 8, 2, 3, 4)
    properties:
      - value: the integer itself
      - position: column index within the 2D array's single row
    grouping: can appear singly or as a contiguous block within the row
Relationships:
  - relationship: relative position
    description: non-zero elements are located relative to the background (0s) within the row.
Action:
  - name: shift
    target: non-zero elements
    input_context: operates on the single row of the input 2D NumPy array
    direction: right (increasing column index)
    magnitude: 2 positions
    effect: changes the column index of non-zero elements
    boundary_condition: elements shifted beyond the last column index (11) are discarded
    consequence: positions vacated by shifted elements become 0
Transformation:
  - type: positional shift
  - description: Extracts the first (and only) row from the input 2D NumPy array. Creates a new 1D sequence (initialized to zeros) of the same length. Iterates through the extracted input row; for each non-zero element found at index `i`, places its value at index `i + 2` in the new sequence, provided `i + 2` is within the sequence bounds. The final result (the new sequence) should be presented, potentially formatted back into a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, 12) if required by the environment.
