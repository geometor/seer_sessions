            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe provided Python code consistently failed with a \"list index out of range\" error across all training and test examples. This indicates a fundamental issue in how the list indices are being accessed or iterated over, rather than a minor flaw in the transformation logic for specific cases.\n\nThe previous analysis correctly identified that the transformation depends on groups of consecutive '2's. However, the specific rule for transforming the second '2' in a group, and potentially the loop control or index calculation, seems flawed or was implemented incorrectly, leading to accessing invalid list indices.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Re-evaluate Group Transformation Rule:** Carefully re-examine each input/output pair to precisely determine the conditions under which the second '2' in a group transforms into an '8'. Pay close attention to group length and position.\n2.  **Analyze Loop and Indexing:** Re-think the iteration process. Ensure that when a group of '2's is processed, the loop index `i` is advanced correctly to the position *after* the group to avoid re-processing or causing index errors at the list's end.\n3.  **Verify Boundary Conditions:** Check how the logic handles groups at the very beginning or end of the list, and groups of different lengths (especially lengths 1, 2, 3, and 4+).\n4.  **Use Code Execution for Metrics:** Verify assumptions about group lengths and transformations in each example.\n\n**Metrics Gathering**\n"
