Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation logic.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

*   The input and output are both sequences (lists) of integers.
*   The length of the input sequence is always the same as the length of the output sequence.
*   The input sequences contain only the integers 0 and 2.
*   The output sequences contain the integers 0, 2, and 8.
*   The integer 0 in the input always remains 0 in the output at the same position.
*   The integer 2 in the input can either remain 2 or change to 8 in the output.
*   The transformation seems to depend on the context of the '2's, specifically their grouping and position relative to '0's or the start of the sequence.
*   Consecutive sequences (groups) of '2's appear to be treated as units.

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - contains only 0s and 2s
  - name: output_sequence
    type: List[int]
    properties:
      - contains only 0s, 2s, and 8s
      - same length as input_sequence
  - name: group_of_twos
    type: concept
    description: A contiguous sub-sequence within the input_sequence containing only the number 2.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index in the input_sequence where the group begins.
      - length: The number of 2s in the group.

relationships:
  - type: mapping
    from: input_sequence element at index i
    to: output_sequence element at index i
  - type: dependency
    element: output value at index i
    depends_on:
      - input value at index i
      - input value at index i-1 (if i > 0)
      - membership of input[i] in a group_of_twos
      - properties of the group_of_twos (start_index, length)

actions:
  - name: identify_groups
    description: Scan the input_sequence to find all consecutive groups_of_twos.
  - name: transform_elements
    description: Iterate through the input_sequence and determine the corresponding output value based on transformation rules.
    rules:
      - If input[i] is 0, output[i] is 0.
      - If input[i] is 2, apply group-based rules:
        - Rule 1: The first '2' of any group_of_twos is transformed to '8'.
        - Rule 2: The second '2' of a group_of_twos is transformed to '8' ONLY IF the group's length is 3 or more AND the group does not start at the beginning of the input_sequence (start_index > 0). Otherwise, it remains '2'.
        - Rule 3: Any subsequent '2's (third, fourth, etc.) in a group_of_twos remain '2'.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty list called `output_sequence`.
2.  Initialize an index variable `i` to 0.
3.  While `i` is less than the length of the `input_sequence`:
    a.  Get the current element `current_element = input_sequence[i]`.
    b.  If `current_element` is 0:
        i.  Append 0 to `output_sequence`.
        ii. Increment `i` by 1.
    c.  If `current_element` is 2:
        i.   Determine the starting index `group_start_index = i`.
        ii.  Count the number of consecutive 2s starting from `i` to find the `group_length`.
        iii. Append 8 to `output_sequence` (for the first '2' in the group).
        iv.  If `group_length` is greater than or equal to 2:
            1.  Check the condition for the second '2': if `group_length` is greater than or equal to 3 AND `group_start_index` is greater than 0, append 8 to `output_sequence`.
            2.  Otherwise (if group length is 2, or group starts at index 0), append 2 to `output_sequence`.
        v.   For the remaining '2's in the group (from the third one up to `group_length`), append 2 to `output_sequence` for each.
        vi.  Increment `i` by `group_length` (to move past the processed group).
4.  Return the `output_sequence`.
