"""
Transforms an input list of 0s and 2s into an output list of 0s, 2s, and 8s. 
Zeros remain unchanged. 
Groups of consecutive 2s are transformed based on their position and length: 
- The first 2 of any group becomes 8.
- The second 2 becomes 8 only if the group length is 3 or more AND the group does not start at index 0; otherwise, it remains 2.
- All subsequent 2s (third, fourth, etc.) in the group remain 2.
