"""
Transforms an input sequence (list) of 0s and 2s into an output list of 0s, 2s, and 8s.
Zeros remain unchanged.
Groups of consecutive 2s are transformed based on their length:
- The first 2 of any group becomes 8.
- The second 2 becomes 8 only if the group length is 4 or more; otherwise, it remains 2.
- All subsequent 2s (third, fourth, etc.) in the group remain 2.

    Finds the index immediately after the end of a consecutive group of 2s

        start_index: The index where the group of 2s begins.
