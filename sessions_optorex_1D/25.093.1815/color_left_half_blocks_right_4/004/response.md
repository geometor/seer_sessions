*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The provided code failed execution on all examples with the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array containing multiple elements is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement condition) without explicitly specifying how to evaluate the array (e.g., using `.any()` or `.all()`).
    *   Reviewing the Python code, the conditions `if input_seq[i] == 2:` and `while current_index < n and input_seq[current_index] == 2:` operate on single elements indexed from the NumPy array, which should yield single boolean values, not arrays. This suggests the error might not be within these specific logical checks inside the loop.
    *   Possible causes include:
        1.  **Input Handling:** The testing environment might be passing the input in an unexpected format (e.g., a nested list/array) which interacts poorly with the initial `np.array(input_seq)` conversion or subsequent indexing.
        2.  **Testing Framework Interaction:** The framework used to test the function might be performing comparisons or checks involving the NumPy array (`input_seq` or `output_seq`) in a way that triggers the ambiguity error, perhaps when comparing the returned NumPy array to the expected list output.
        3.  **Hidden Boolean Context:** There might be an implicit boolean check on the array elsewhere, although it's not obvious from the provided code snippet.
    *   **Strategy:**
        1.  Simplify the code by removing the NumPy dependency. Standard Python lists can handle this task effectively and might avoid the interaction issues with the testing framework or input handling.
        2.  Verify that the core transformation logic (identifying blocks of '2's and changing the first floor(L/2) elements) correctly matches all training examples, as established in the previous analysis.
        3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the confirmed logic, ensuring clarity and precision.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Execution Status:** All 7 training examples and the 1 test example failed execution due to the same runtime error.
    *   **Error Type:** `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.
    *   **Logical Analysis (Re-verified):**
        *   The core logic, when applied manually to the examples, produces the correct output for all 7 training cases.
        *   Example 1: Input `[0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[0,0,0,8,2,0,8,2,0,0,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 2: Input `[0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2,2,2,2,2]` (len 6, changes 3), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[0,0,8,8,8,2,2,2,0,8,2,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 3: Input `[2,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2,2,2,2,2]` (len 6, changes 3), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[8,8,8,2,2,2,0,8,2,0,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 4: Input `[2,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2,2,2]` (len 4, changes 2), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[8,2,0,8,8,2,2,0,8,2,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 5: Input `[0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2,2,2,2]` (len 5, changes 2). Output: `[0,0,8,2,0,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 6: Input `[0,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[0,0,8,2,0,8,2,0,8,2,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 7: Input `[0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[0,8,2,0,8,2,0,0,8,2,0,0]` (Correct).
    *   **Conclusion:** The transformation logic itself appears sound and correctly explains the examples. The error is likely an implementation or environment issue, not a logical one. Removing NumPy is the primary step for resolution.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    Task: Sequence Transformation by Block Modification

    Input_Domain:
      Type: Sequence (List) of Integers
      Allowed_Values: [0, 2]
      Structure: Linear sequence

    Output_Domain:
      Type: Sequence (List) of Integers
      Allowed_Values: [0, 2, 8]
      Structure: Linear sequence, same length as input

    Objects:
      - Sequence_Element:
          Type: Integer
          Properties:
            - Value: 0, 2, or 8
            - Position: Index within the sequence
      - Contiguous_Block_of_Twos:
          Type: Sub-sequence within the Input Sequence
          Properties:
            - Elements: All are 2
            - Length: L (where L >= 1)
            - Start_Index: Position in Input Sequence
            - End_Index: Position in Input Sequence (exclusive)

    Relationships:
      - Output sequence corresponds positionally to the input sequence.
      - '0' elements in the input map directly to '0' elements in the output at the same position.
      - '2' elements in the input may map to '8' or '2' in the output, depending on their block context.

    Actions/Transformation_Rule:
      - Scan: Iterate through the input sequence to identify contiguous blocks of '2's.
      - Segment: For each element, determine if it's '0' or part of a '2's block.
      - Analyze_Block: If an element starts a block of '2's, determine the block's start index, end index, and length (L).
      - Calculate_Changes: Compute the number of elements to change within the block: `num_changes = floor(L / 2)`.
      - Modify: In the output sequence being built, place '8's at the first `num_changes` positions corresponding to the block.
      - Copy: Place '2's at the remaining positions corresponding to the block. Place '0's directly.
      - Advance_Scan: After processing a block, continue scanning from the position immediately after the block.

    Derived_Properties:
      - Block_Modification_Count: floor(Length of Contiguous_Block_of_Twos / 2)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create a new list, `output_sequence`, as a copy of the `input_sequence`.
    2.  Initialize an index `i` to 0, representing the current position being examined in the `input_sequence`.
    3.  While `i` is less than the length of the `input_sequence`:
        a.  Check the value of the element at `input_sequence[i]`.
        b.  If the element is '2':
            i.  Record the current index `i` as the `start_index` of a potential block of '2's.
            ii. Initialize a `current_index` to `i`.
            iii. While `current_index` is less than the length of the `input_sequence` AND the element at `input_sequence[current_index]` is '2', increment `current_index`.
            iv. The `end_index` of the block is `current_index` (this index is *after* the last '2' in the block).
            v. Calculate the length of the block: `length = end_index - start_index`.
            vi. Calculate the number of elements to change to '8': `num_changes = length // 2` (integer division for floor).
            vii. Iterate from `j = 0` up to (but not including) `num_changes`: Set the element at `output_sequence[start_index + j]` to '8'.
            viii. Set the main index `i` to `end_index` to continue scanning *after* the processed block.
        c.  If the element is '0':
            i.  The '0' is already correctly copied in `output_sequence`.
            ii. Increment the main index `i` by 1.
    4.  Return the modified `output_sequence`.
