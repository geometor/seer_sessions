*   **Perception of Task Elements**:
    *   The input and output are both sequences (or lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   The input sequences contain only the digits 0 and 2.
    *   The output sequences contain the digits 0, 2, and 8.
    *   The transformation modifies some of the '2's in the input sequence into '8's in the output sequence.
    *   The '0's in the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence.
    *   The transformation of '2' to '8' depends on the position of the '2' within a contiguous block of '2's. Specifically, it seems related to the length of the block and the position within that block.

    Task: Digit Sequence Transformation

    Objects:
      - Input_Sequence:
          Type: List of Integers
          Properties:
            - Elements: Can be 0 or 2
            - Length: Variable
      - Output_Sequence:
          Type: List of Integers
          Properties:
            - Elements: Can be 0, 2, or 8
            - Length: Same as Input_Sequence
      - Contiguous_Block_of_Twos:
          Type: Sub-sequence within Input_Sequence
          Properties:
            - Elements: All are 2
            - Length: L (where L >= 1)
            - Start_Index: Position in Input_Sequence
            - End_Index: Position in Input_Sequence
      - Element:
          Type: Integer
          Properties:
            - Value: 0, 2, or 8
            - Position: Index within a sequence

    Relationships:
      - Output_Sequence is derived from Input_Sequence.
      - Elements in Output_Sequence correspond positionally to elements in Input_Sequence.
      - The transformation rule for an element '2' depends on its membership and position within a Contiguous_Block_of_Twos.

    Actions:
      - Identify: Locate all Contiguous_Block_of_Twos within the Input_Sequence.
      - Calculate: For each block of length L, determine the number of elements to change: floor(L / 2).
      - Transform: For each block, change the first floor(L / 2) elements with value '2' to '8'.
      - Copy: Elements with value '0' and the remaining '2's (those not transformed to '8') are copied directly to the Output_Sequence at the same position.

    Derived_Properties:
      - Number_of_Changes: floor(Length of Contiguous_Block_of_Twos / 2)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
    2.  Iterate through the input sequence element by element, keeping track of the current index.
    3.  If the current element is '0', copy '0' to the corresponding position in the output sequence.
    4.  If the current element is '2', identify the start and end of the contiguous block of '2's that this element belongs to.
    5.  Calculate the length (L) of this contiguous block of '2's.
    6.  Calculate the number of '2's to change to '8' within this block: `num_changes = floor(L / 2)`.
    7.  For the current block, change the first `num_changes` occurrences of '2' to '8' in the output sequence at their corresponding positions.
    8.  Copy the remaining `L - num_changes` occurrences of '2' from the input block to their corresponding positions in the output sequence.
    9.  Advance the iteration index past the current block of '2's to avoid processing elements within the same block multiple times.
    10. Repeat steps 3-9 until the end of the input sequence is reached.
    11. Return the completed output sequence.

*   **General Assessment and Strategy:**
    *   The provided code failed execution on all examples with the error: `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This error typically occurs in Python when a NumPy array containing multiple elements is used in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., an `if` statement condition) without explicitly specifying how to evaluate the array (e.g., using `.any()` or `.all()`).
    *   Reviewing the Python code, the conditions `if input_seq[i] == 2:` and `while current_index < n and input_seq[current_index] == 2:` operate on single elements indexed from the NumPy array, which should yield single boolean values, not arrays. This suggests the error might not be within these specific logical checks inside the loop.
    *   Possible causes include:
        1.  **Input Handling:** The testing environment might be passing the input in an unexpected format (e.g., a nested list/array) which interacts poorly with the initial `np.array(input_seq)` conversion or subsequent indexing.
        2.  **Testing Framework Interaction:** The framework used to test the function might be performing comparisons or checks involving the NumPy array (`input_seq` or `output_seq`) in a way that triggers the ambiguity error, perhaps when comparing the returned NumPy array to the expected list output.
        3.  **Hidden Boolean Context:** There might be an implicit boolean check on the array elsewhere, although it's not obvious from the provided code snippet.
    *   **Strategy:**
        1.  Simplify the code by removing the NumPy dependency. Standard Python lists can handle this task effectively and might avoid the interaction issues with the testing framework or input handling.
        2.  Verify that the core transformation logic (identifying blocks of '2's and changing the first floor(L/2) elements) correctly matches all training examples, as established in the previous analysis.
        3.  Update the YAML facts and natural language program to reflect the confirmed logic, ensuring clarity and precision.

*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Execution Status:** All 7 training examples and the 1 test example failed execution due to the same runtime error.
    *   **Error Type:** `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`.
    *   **Logical Analysis (Re-verified):**
        *   The core logic, when applied manually to the examples, produces the correct output for all 7 training cases.
        *   Example 1: Input `[0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[0,0,0,8,2,0,8,2,0,0,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 2: Input `[0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2,2,2,2,2]` (len 6, changes 3), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[0,0,8,8,8,2,2,2,0,8,2,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 3: Input `[2,2,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2,2,2,2,2]` (len 6, changes 3), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[8,8,8,2,2,2,0,8,2,0,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 4: Input `[2,2,0,2,2,2,2,0,2,2,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2,2,2]` (len 4, changes 2), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[8,2,0,8,8,2,2,0,8,2,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 5: Input `[0,0,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2,2,2,2]` (len 5, changes 2). Output: `[0,0,8,2,0,8,8,2,2,2,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 6: Input `[0,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[0,0,8,2,0,8,2,0,8,2,0,0]` (Correct).
        *   Example 7: Input `[0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,0,0]`. Blocks: `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1), `[2,2]` (len 2, changes 1). Output: `[0,8,2,0,8,2,0,0,8,2,0,0]` (Correct).
    *   **Conclusion:** The transformation logic itself appears sound and correctly explains the examples. The error is likely an implementation or environment issue, not a logical one. Removing NumPy is the primary step for resolution.

    Relationships:

      - Segment: For each element, determine if it's '0' or part of a '2's block.
      - Analyze_Block: If an element starts a block of '2's, determine the block's start index, end index, and length (L).
      - Calculate_Changes: Compute the number of elements to change within the block: `num_changes = floor(L / 2)`.
      - Modify: In the output sequence being built, place '8's at the first `num_changes` positions corresponding to the block.
      - Copy: Place '2's at the remaining positions corresponding to the block. Place '0's directly.
      - Advance_Scan: After processing a block, continue scanning from the position immediately after the block.

*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Create a new list, `output_sequence`, as a copy of the `input_sequence`.
    2.  Initialize an index `i` to 0, representing the current position being examined in the `input_sequence`.
    3.  While `i` is less than the length of the `input_sequence`:
        a.  Check the value of the element at `input_sequence[i]`.
        b.  If the element is '2':
            i.  Record the current index `i` as the `start_index` of a potential block of '2's.
            ii. Initialize a `current_index` to `i`.
            iii. While `current_index` is less than the length of the `input_sequence` AND the element at `input_sequence[current_index]` is '2', increment `current_index`.
            iv. The `end_index` of the block is `current_index` (this index is *after* the last '2' in the block).
            v. Calculate the length of the block: `length = end_index - start_index`.
            vi. Calculate the number of elements to change to '8': `num_changes = length // 2` (integer division for floor).
            vii. Iterate from `j = 0` up to (but not including) `num_changes`: Set the element at `output_sequence[start_index + j]` to '8'.
            viii. Set the main index `i` to `end_index` to continue scanning *after* the processed block.
        c.  If the element is '0':
            i.  The '0' is already correctly copied in `output_sequence`.
            ii. Increment the main index `i` by 1.
    4.  Return the modified `output_sequence`.
