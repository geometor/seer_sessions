The comparison `input_seq[i] == 2` behaves differently when `input_seq` is a NumPy array, leading to this ambiguity error.\n    *   The core transformation logic (identifying blocks of '2's, calculating floor(length/2), and changing the first portion to '8's) appears consistent with all provided input/output pairs when traced manually.\n    *   **Strategy**: The primary issue is not with the derived transformation *rule* but with its implementation's handling of the input data type. The natural language program and YAML facts seem correct based on the visual examples. The next step (coder phase) will need to adjust the Python code to correctly handle NumPy arrays if that is indeed the input type, while preserving the transformation logic. For now, we will verify the properties of the examples assuming they can be treated as sequences/lists for analysis.\n\n*   **Metrics Gathering**:\n    Let's verify the characteristics of a few examples.\n\n"
