    Transforms an input sequence of 0s and 2s into an output sequence of 0s, 2s, and 8s.
    The transformation identifies contiguous blocks of '2's in the input. For each block
    of length L, the first floor(L / 2) elements ('2's) within that block are changed
    to '8' in the output sequence. All other elements ('0's and the remaining '2's)
    are copied directly to the output sequence at the same position.
    Input is assumed to be a list or list-like sequence of integers (0 or 2).
