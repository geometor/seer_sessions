*   **Perception of Task Elements**:
    *   The input and output are both sequences (or lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   The input sequences contain only the digits 0 and 2.
    *   The output sequences contain the digits 0, 2, and 8.
    *   The transformation modifies some of the '2's in the input sequence into '8's in the output sequence.
    *   The '0's in the input sequence remain unchanged in the output sequence.
    *   The transformation of '2' to '8' depends on the position of the '2' within a contiguous block of '2's. Specifically, it seems related to the length of the block and the position within that block.

*   **YAML Facts**:
    
```yaml
    Task: Digit Sequence Transformation

    Objects:
      - Input_Sequence:
          Type: List of Integers
          Properties:
            - Elements: Can be 0 or 2
            - Length: Variable
      - Output_Sequence:
          Type: List of Integers
          Properties:
            - Elements: Can be 0, 2, or 8
            - Length: Same as Input_Sequence
      - Contiguous_Block_of_Twos:
          Type: Sub-sequence within Input_Sequence
          Properties:
            - Elements: All are 2
            - Length: L (where L >= 1)
            - Start_Index: Position in Input_Sequence
            - End_Index: Position in Input_Sequence
      - Element:
          Type: Integer
          Properties:
            - Value: 0, 2, or 8
            - Position: Index within a sequence

    Relationships:
      - Output_Sequence is derived from Input_Sequence.
      - Elements in Output_Sequence correspond positionally to elements in Input_Sequence.
      - The transformation rule for an element '2' depends on its membership and position within a Contiguous_Block_of_Twos.

    Actions:
      - Identify: Locate all Contiguous_Block_of_Twos within the Input_Sequence.
      - Calculate: For each block of length L, determine the number of elements to change: floor(L / 2).
      - Transform: For each block, change the first floor(L / 2) elements with value '2' to '8'.
      - Copy: Elements with value '0' and the remaining '2's (those not transformed to '8') are copied directly to the Output_Sequence at the same position.

    Derived_Properties:
      - Number_of_Changes: floor(Length of Contiguous_Block_of_Twos / 2)
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program**:
    1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
    2.  Iterate through the input sequence element by element, keeping track of the current index.
    3.  If the current element is '0', copy '0' to the corresponding position in the output sequence.
    4.  If the current element is '2', identify the start and end of the contiguous block of '2's that this element belongs to.
    5.  Calculate the length (L) of this contiguous block of '2's.
    6.  Calculate the number of '2's to change to '8' within this block: `num_changes = floor(L / 2)`.
    7.  For the current block, change the first `num_changes` occurrences of '2' to '8' in the output sequence at their corresponding positions.
    8.  Copy the remaining `L - num_changes` occurrences of '2' from the input block to their corresponding positions in the output sequence.
    9.  Advance the iteration index past the current block of '2's to avoid processing elements within the same block multiple times.
    10. Repeat steps 3-9 until the end of the input sequence is reached.
    11. Return the completed output sequence.
