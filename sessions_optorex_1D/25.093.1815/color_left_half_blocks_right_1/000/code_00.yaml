task_type: sequence_transformation
input_elements:
  - type: integer
    values: [0, 2]
    role: data_value_or_delimiter
output_elements:
  - type: integer
    values: [0, 2, 8]
    role: transformed_data_value
structure:
  - linear_sequence
invariants:
  - sequence_length
  - element_value_0: Elements with value 0 are unchanged.
  - element_position_0: The positions of elements with value 0 are preserved.
relationships:
  - type: contiguity
    description: The transformation depends on contiguous blocks of '2's.
  - type: boundary_condition
    description: Value '0' and sequence start/end act as boundaries for blocks of '2's.
actions:
  - identify_blocks: Find contiguous sequences of the value '2'.
  - calculate_length: Determine the length (L) of each identified block.
  - calculate_modification_count: Compute N = floor(L / 2) for each block.
  - modify_elements: Change the first N elements of each block from '2' to '8'.
