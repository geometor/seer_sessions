The output sequences contain integers 0, 2, and 8.\n*   **Structure:** The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the input sequence.\n*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to selectively change some occurrences of the number 2 into the number 8, while leaving 0s and other 2s unchanged. The change seems related to the position of the 2s relative to each other and to the 0s.\n*   **Pattern:** The value 0 seems to act as a boundary or separator. The transformation applies to contiguous blocks of 2s found between 0s or sequence boundaries. Within a block of `L` consecutive 2s, the first `floor(L/2)` elements are changed to 8.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
