"""
Transforms a sequence of integers based on contiguous blocks of the value '2'.
For each contiguous block of '2's with length L, the first floor(L/2) elements 
of that block are changed to '8' in the output sequence. Elements with value '0' 
remain unchanged and act as delimiters for the blocks of '2's. Sequence start
and end also act as delimiters.

def find_contiguous_block_end(sequence, start_index, value):

  Finds the end index (inclusive) of a contiguous block of a specific value 
  starting from a given index.

  Args:
    sequence: The input sequence (list or similar iterable).
    start_index: The index where the block is expected to start.
    value: The value that defines the block.

  Returns:
    The index of the last element in the contiguous block.
