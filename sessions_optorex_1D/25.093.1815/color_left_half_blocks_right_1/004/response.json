            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core transformation logic derived previously appears consistent with all provided training examples. The logic involves identifying contiguous blocks of the number `2`, delimited by `0`s or the sequence boundaries, and replacing the first `floor(L/2)` elements of each block (where `L` is the block length) with the number `8`.\n\nThe errors reported (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...\") during the execution of the previous code attempt strongly suggest an issue with data type handling rather than the transformation logic itself. The test environment likely passed the input data in a format (e.g., NumPy array, or perhaps the raw string) that the Python code's element-wise comparison (`if input_sequence[i] == 0:`) could not handle directly without specific methods like `.any()` or `.all()`, or appropriate parsing.\n\nThe strategy is to reaffirm the transformation logic based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples, assuming the input is conceptually a 1D sequence of integers. The coder phase must ensure the implementation correctly handles the actual data type provided by the execution environment, potentially by explicitly converting the input to a standard Python list or adapting the comparison logic for array types.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nThe transformation logic was manually verified against each training example, assuming the input strings are parsed into lists of integers.\n\n*   **Input Parser (Conceptual):** Assume a function `parse(input_string)` converts \"2 2 0...\" into `[2, 2, 0, ...]`.\n*   **Transformation Rule Application:**\n    *   Identify contiguous blocks of `2`s.\n    *   For each block of length `L`, starting at index `start_idx`:\n        *   Calculate `N = L // 2` (integer division for floor).\n        *   Replace elements from `start_idx` to `start_idx + N - 1` with `8`.\n*   **Verification Result:** This process correctly reproduced the output for all 7 training examples (detailed walkthrough omitted for brevity, but confirmed consistent).\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
