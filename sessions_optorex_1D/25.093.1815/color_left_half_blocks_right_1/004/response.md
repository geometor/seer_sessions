**General Assessment and Strategy**

The core transformation logic derived previously appears consistent with all provided training examples. The logic involves identifying contiguous blocks of the number `2`, delimited by `0`s or the sequence boundaries, and replacing the first `floor(L/2)` elements of each block (where `L` is the block length) with the number `8`.

The errors reported ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") during the execution of the previous code attempt strongly suggest an issue with data type handling rather than the transformation logic itself. The test environment likely passed the input data in a format (e.g., NumPy array, or perhaps the raw string) that the Python code's element-wise comparison (`if input_sequence[i] == 0:`) could not handle directly without specific methods like `.any()` or `.all()`, or appropriate parsing.

The strategy is to reaffirm the transformation logic based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples, assuming the input is conceptually a 1D sequence of integers. The coder phase must ensure the implementation correctly handles the actual data type provided by the execution environment, potentially by explicitly converting the input to a standard Python list or adapting the comparison logic for array types.

**Metrics and Verification**

The transformation logic was manually verified against each training example, assuming the input strings are parsed into lists of integers.

*   **Input Parser (Conceptual):** Assume a function `parse(input_string)` converts "2 2 0..." into `[2, 2, 0, ...]`.
*   **Transformation Rule Application:**
    *   Identify contiguous blocks of `2`s.
    *   For each block of length `L`, starting at index `start_idx`:
        *   Calculate `N = L // 2` (integer division for floor).
        *   Replace elements from `start_idx` to `start_idx + N - 1` with `8`.
*   **Verification Result:** This process correctly reproduced the output for all 7 training examples (detailed walkthrough omitted for brevity, but confirmed consistent).

    description: Transformation applies to contiguous blocks of '2's.
  - type: boundary_condition
    description: Value '0' and sequence start/end act as boundaries defining blocks of '2's.
actions:
  - parse_input: Convert input string representation into a 1D list/array of integers.
  - identify_blocks: Iterate through the sequence, locating contiguous segments containing only the value '2'. Segments are delimited by '0's or sequence boundaries.
  - calculate_length: Determine the length (L) of each identified block of '2's.
  - calculate_modification_count: For each block, compute N = floor(L / 2).
  - modify_elements: For each block starting at index `start_idx`, change the values at indices `start_idx` through `start_idx + N - 1` from '2' to '8' in a copy of the sequence.
  - format_output: Convert the resulting list/array back to the required output format (space-separated string).

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Parse Input:** Read the input sequence of space-separated integers and convert it into a list of integer values.
2.  **Initialize Output:** Create a new list by copying the parsed input list. This new list will store the results.
3.  **Iterate and Identify Blocks:** Scan the input list from left to right using an index.
4.  **Handle Delimiters:** If the element at the current index is `0`, leave the corresponding element in the output list unchanged and advance the index.
5.  **Process Blocks of '2's:** If the element at the current index is `2`:
    a.  Mark this index as the start (`start_idx`) of a potential block of `2`s.
    b.  Continue scanning forward from `start_idx` to find the end (`end_idx`) of the contiguous block of `2`s (i.e., find the last index `k` such that all elements from `start_idx` to `k` are `2`).
    c.  Calculate the length of this block: `L = end_idx - start_idx + 1`.
    d.  Calculate the number of elements to modify: `N = L // 2` (integer division for floor).
    e.  Modify the output list: For each index `j` from `start_idx` up to `start_idx + N - 1`, change the value in the output list at index `j` to `8`.
    f.  Advance the main scanning index to the position immediately after the processed block (`end_idx + 1`).
6.  **Repeat:** Continue steps 4 and 5 until the entire input list has been scanned.
7.  **Format Output:** Convert the final output list back into a sequence of space-separated integers.
8.  **Return:** Return the formatted output sequence.
