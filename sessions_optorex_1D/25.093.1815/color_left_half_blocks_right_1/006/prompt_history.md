Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Data:** Both inputs and outputs are linear sequences (lists) of integers.
*   **Values:** The input sequences contain only the integers 0 and 2. The output sequences contain integers 0, 2, and 8.
*   **Structure:** The length of the output sequence is always identical to the length of the input sequence.
*   **Transformation:** The transformation appears to selectively change some occurrences of the number 2 into the number 8, while leaving 0s and other 2s unchanged. The change seems related to the position of the 2s relative to each other and to the 0s.
*   **Pattern:** The value 0 seems to act as a boundary or separator. The transformation applies to contiguous blocks of 2s found between 0s or sequence boundaries. Within a block of `L` consecutive 2s, the first `floor(L/2)` elements are changed to 8.

**Facts:**


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_elements:
  - type: integer
    values: [0, 2]
    role: data_value_or_delimiter
output_elements:
  - type: integer
    values: [0, 2, 8]
    role: transformed_data_value
structure:
  - linear_sequence
invariants:
  - sequence_length
  - element_value_0: Elements with value 0 are unchanged.
  - element_position_0: The positions of elements with value 0 are preserved.
relationships:
  - type: contiguity
    description: The transformation depends on contiguous blocks of '2's.
  - type: boundary_condition
    description: Value '0' and sequence start/end act as boundaries for blocks of '2's.
actions:
  - identify_blocks: Find contiguous sequences of the value '2'.
  - calculate_length: Determine the length (L) of each identified block.
  - calculate_modification_count: Compute N = floor(L / 2) for each block.
  - modify_elements: Change the first N elements of each block from '2' to '8'.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a new sequence by copying the input sequence. This will be the output sequence.
2.  Initialize a pointer (index) to the beginning of the input sequence (index 0).
3.  While the pointer is within the bounds of the sequence:
    a.  Check the value at the pointer's current position in the input sequence.
    b.  If the value is 0, move the pointer one position to the right.
    c.  If the value is 2:
        i.  Identify the contiguous block of 2s starting from the current pointer position. Find the starting index (`start_idx`) and the ending index (`end_idx`) of this block.
        ii. Calculate the length of the block: `L = end_idx - start_idx + 1`.
        iii. Calculate the number of elements to modify: `N = floor(L / 2)`.
        iv. For each position from `start_idx` up to (`start_idx + N - 1`), change the value in the *output* sequence at that position to 8.
        v. Move the pointer to the position immediately *after* the identified block (`end_idx + 1`).
4.  Return the modified output sequence.
