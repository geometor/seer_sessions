task_type: sequence_transformation
input_elements:
  - type: integer_sequence # Assumed based on visual representation
    values: [0, 2]
    role: data_value_or_delimiter
output_elements:
  - type: integer_sequence
    values: [0, 2, 8]
    role: transformed_data_value
structure:
  - linear_sequence
invariants:
  - sequence_length: Input and output sequences have the same length.
  - element_value_0: Elements with value 0 remain unchanged.
  - element_position_0: The positions of elements with value 0 are preserved.
relationships:
  - type: contiguity
    description: The transformation operates on contiguous blocks of '2's.
  - type: boundary_condition
    description: Value '0', sequence start, and sequence end act as boundaries defining the blocks of '2's.
actions:
  - scan_sequence: Iterate through the input sequence.
  - identify_blocks: When a '2' is encountered, find the start and end indices of the contiguous block of '2's.
  - calculate_length: Determine the length (L) of each identified block.
  - calculate_modification_count: Compute N = floor(L / 2) for each block.
  - modify_elements: In a copy of the sequence, change the value from '2' to '8' for the first N elements within each identified block's original positions.
  - skip_processed: Advance the scan pointer past the currently processed block.
