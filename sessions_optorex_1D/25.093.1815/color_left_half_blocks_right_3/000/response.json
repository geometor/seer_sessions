            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists or arrays) of single digits. The digits observed are 0, 2, and 8. The length of the output sequence is always the same as the input sequence.\n2.  **Digit Transformation:** The digit '0' always remains '0'. The digit '2' sometimes remains '2' and sometimes changes to '8'. The digit '8' only appears in the output where a '2' was changed.\n3.  **Context Dependency:** The transformation of a '2' to an '8' is not uniform; it depends on its position within the sequence and the values of its neighboring elements.\n4.  **Block Pattern:** The changes seem related to contiguous blocks (runs) of '2's. Specifically, changes occur at the beginning of blocks that are either at the very start of the sequence or immediately follow a '0'.\n5.  **Quantitative Change:** Within an eligible block of `L` consecutive '2's (preceded by '0' or sequence start), the number of '2's converted to '8's appears to be related to the length `L`. Observing the examples suggests that the first `floor(L / 2)` twos in such a block are converted.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
