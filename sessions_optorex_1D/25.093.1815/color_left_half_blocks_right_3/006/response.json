            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" consistently appears across all examples. This strongly indicates an issue not with the core transformation logic derived previously, but with how the data type is being handled between the test harness and the `transform` function. The test environment is likely passing NumPy arrays, while the function is written to expect standard Python lists. Operations like `if input_list[i] == 2:` or `if input_list[i-1] == 0:` might behave unexpectedly if `input_list` is a NumPy array where direct boolean evaluation is ambiguous.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  **Confirm the Hypothesis:** Assume the core transformation logic (finding blocks of '2' preceded by '0' or start-of-sequence, and changing the first `floor(length/2)` elements to '8') is correct, as manual tracing confirmed it works for all examples.\n2.  **Refine Description for Coder:** Maintain the existing natural language program describing the transformation logic, as it appears correct. Emphasize in the description or notes that the input should be treated as a standard Python list of integers for the logic to apply correctly. The coder phase will need to ensure appropriate type handling or conversion if the input is indeed a NumPy array.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nManual tracing of the proposed logic (`floor(L/2)` rule) against each training example confirms that the *intended* logic produces the *correct* output for all provided cases.\n\n*   **Example 1:** Input `[0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Blocks: `[2, 2, 2]` (L=3, N=1), `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (L=4, N=2). Output: `[0, 8, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 2:** Input `[0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Blocks: `[2, 2]` (L=2, N=1), `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (L=5, N=2). Output: `[0, 8, 2, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 3:** Input `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]`. Blocks: `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (L=4, N=2), `[2, 2, 2, 2]` (L=4, N=2). Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 0]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 4:** Input `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Blocks: `[2, 2, 2]` (L=3, N=1), `[2, 2, 2]` (L=3, N=1). Output: `[0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 5:** Input `[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]`. Blocks: `[2, 2, 2]` (L=3, N=1), `[2, 2, 2]` (L=3, N=1). Output: `[0, 0, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 6:** Input `[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0]`. Blocks: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (L=5, N=2), `[2, 2, 2]` (L=3, N=1). Output: `[0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 2, 2, 0]`. Matches.\n*   **Example 7:** Input `[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]`. Blocks: `[2, 2, 2]` (L=3, N=1), `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (L=6, N=3). Output: `[8, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0]`. Matches.\n\nThe errors reported during execution are therefore artifacts of the testing environment or type mismatch, not flaws in the transformation logic itself. No code execution is needed here as the issue is understood to be type-related, and the logic has been manually verified.\n\n**Facts**\n\n"
