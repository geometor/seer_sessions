"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on the following rule:
Iterate through the input sequence (list of integers). Identify contiguous blocks 
of the digit '2'. For each block of '2's that starts either at the beginning 
of the sequence (index 0) or immediately follows a '0', calculate the length 'L' 
of the block. Change the first 'floor(L / 2)' digits in that block from '2' 
to '8' in the output sequence. All other digits ('0's and '2's not part of 
the modified segment of such a block) remain unchanged.
