Identify contiguous blocks \nof the digit '2'. For each block of '2's that starts either at the beginning \nof the sequence (index 0) or immediately follows a '0', calculate the length 'L' \nof the block. Change the first 'floor(L / 2)' digits in that block from '2' \nto '8' in the output sequence.
