```python
"""
Processes an input sequence (list) containing only the integers 0 and 2.
It iterates through the sequence, identifying consecutive blocks of 2s that start either at the beginning of the sequence or immediately after a 0 (qualifying blocks).
For each qualifying block, it transforms specific elements based on their position within the block and the block's total length:
- The first 2 becomes 8.
- The second 2 becomes 8 if the block length is 4 or more.
- The third 2 becomes 8 if the block length is 6 or more.
- All other 2s within the qualifying block, and all 2s not part of a qualifying block, remain 2.
- Elements with value 0 remain 0.
The function returns the transformed sequence as a new list.
