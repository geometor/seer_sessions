If the value is `0`, append `0` to the output sequence and move to the next index.\nb.  If the value is `2`:\n    i.  Check if this `2` marks the beginning of a \"qualifying block\". A block qualifies if it starts at the very beginning of the sequence (index 0) or if the element immediately preceding it is `0`.\n    ii. If it *is* the start of a qualifying block:\n        1.  Determine the total `length` of the consecutive block of `2`s starting from the current index.\n        2.  Iterate through this block from its start (position 0) up to its `length`:\n            *   For the first `2` (position 0), append `8` to the output sequence.\n            *   For the second `2` (position 1), append `8` if the block `length` is 4 or more; otherwise, append `2`.\n            *   For the third `2` (position 2), append `8` if the block `length` is 6 or more; otherwise, append `2`.\n            *   For any subsequent `2`s (positions 3, 4, ...), append `2`.\n        3.  Advance the main iteration index by the `length` of the block just processed to avoid re-evaluating elements within it.\n    iii. If it *is not* the start of a qualifying block (meaning it is preceded by another `2`), append `2` to the output sequence and move to the next index.\nContinue iteration until all elements of the input sequence have been processed.\nReturn the completed output sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\n# No external libraries needed for this specific logic\n\ndef _get_consecutive_twos_length(sequence, start_index):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to find the length of consecutive 2s from a start index.\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(start_index, len(sequence)):\n        if sequence[i] == 2:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    return count\n\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence (list or array of integers).\n    \"\"\"\n    # initialize output_sequence\n    output_sequence = []\n    n = len(input_sequence)\n    i = 0 # Main loop index\n\n    # Iterate through the input sequence\n    while i < n:\n        current_val = input_sequence[i]\n\n        # Condition a: If the value is 0, copy it and move on\n        if current_val == 0:\n            output_sequence.append(0)\n            i += 1\n            continue # Proceed to the next iteration\n\n        # Condition b: If the value is 2\n        if current_val == 2:\n            # Check if it's the start of a qualifying block (index 0 or preceded by 0)\n            is_start_of_qualifying_block = (i == 0 or input_sequence[i-1] == 0)\n\n            # Condition b.ii: If it IS the start of a qualifying block\n            if is_start_of_qualifying_block:\n                # 1.
