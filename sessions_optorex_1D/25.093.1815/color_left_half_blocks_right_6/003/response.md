```python
"""
Accept an input sequence (list or array) of integers, containing only 0s and 2s.
Initialize an empty output sequence.
Iterate through the input sequence using an index, ensuring not to re-process elements handled within a block.
At the current index, examine the integer value:
a.  If the value is `0`, append `0` to the output sequence and move to the next index.
b.  If the value is `2`:
    i.  Check if this `2` marks the beginning of a "qualifying block". A block qualifies if it starts at the very beginning of the sequence (index 0) or if the element immediately preceding it is `0`.
    ii. If it *is* the start of a qualifying block:
        1.  Determine the total `length` of the consecutive block of `2`s starting from the current index.
        2.  Iterate through this block from its start (position 0) up to its `length`:
            *   For the first `2` (position 0), append `8` to the output sequence.
            *   For the second `2` (position 1), append `8` if the block `length` is 4 or more; otherwise, append `2`.
            *   For the third `2` (position 2), append `8` if the block `length` is 6 or more; otherwise, append `2`.
            *   For any subsequent `2`s (positions 3, 4, ...), append `2`.
        3.  Advance the main iteration index by the `length` of the block just processed to avoid re-evaluating elements within it.
    iii. If it *is not* the start of a qualifying block (meaning it is preceded by another `2`), append `2` to the output sequence and move to the next index.
Continue iteration until all elements of the input sequence have been processed.
Return the completed output sequence.
