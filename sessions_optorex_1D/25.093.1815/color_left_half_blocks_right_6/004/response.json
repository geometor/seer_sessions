            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe provided training examples (`train_1` through `train_7`) consistently demonstrate a transformation rule applied to sequences of `0`s and `2`s. The core logic identified previously, involving the transformation of `2`s to `8`s based on their position within \"qualifying\" consecutive blocks and the length of those blocks, appears to hold true across all examples.\n\nThe error message reported (`The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`) strongly suggests an issue outside the core transformation logic itself. This error typically occurs in Python when code attempts to use a NumPy array in a context requiring a single boolean value (e.g., `if some_numpy_array:`). This indicates that during the testing phase where the error occurred, the `transform` function was likely called with an input (or processed intermediate data) that was a NumPy array instead of the expected standard Python list of integers. The function's internal logic, particularly checks like `if current_val == 0:` or `if current_val == 2:`, works correctly with list elements but can lead to this ambiguity error if `current_val` somehow became an array.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Validate Logic:** Re-confirm the transformation logic by manually tracing or scripting the analysis for all examples (as done in the thought process).\n2.  **Isolate Error Source:** Assume the logic is correct and the error stems from the testing environment's data handling. The fix would involve ensuring the `transform` function receives its input strictly as a Python list of integers, not a NumPy array.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the facts and natural language program to be precise and reflect the confirmed understanding across all examples. The core logic does not need changing based on the examples, only confirmation.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\nBased on the `tool_code` execution:\n\n*   **Consistency:** Input and output sequences maintain the same length across all examples.\n*   **Element Mapping:** `0`s in the input map directly to `0`s in the output in the same positions. Some `2`s in the input map to `8`s in the output, while others remain `2`s. The total count of (`2`s + `8`s) in the output equals the count of `2`s in the input.\n*   **Block Identification:** The analysis identified consecutive blocks of `2`s in each input. A block is marked as \"qualifying\" if it starts at index 0 or is immediately preceded by a `0`.\n*   **Transformation Rule Confirmation:**\n    *   Transformations from `2` to `8` only occur within qualifying blocks.\n    *   Within a qualifying block:\n        *   The 1st element becomes `8`.\n        *   The 2nd element becomes `8` only if the block length is 4 or more.\n        *   The 3rd element becomes `8` only if the block length is 6 or more.\n        *   All other elements (4th onwards, or 2nd/3rd in shorter blocks) remain `2`.\n*   **Error Context:** The metrics analysis reinforces the correctness of the logical rule derived previously. The reported execution error is therefore unlikely to be caused by the rule itself but rather by the data type presented to the function during testing.\n\n## Facts (YAML)\n\n"
