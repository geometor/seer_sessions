objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains only 0s and 2s (input) or 0s, 2s, and 8s (output)
      - fixed length (input length equals output length)
  - name: block_of_twos
    type: consecutive subsequence of 2s
    properties:
      - start_index: integer
      - length: integer (number of 2s)
      - qualifying: boolean (true if starts at index 0 or after a 0)
  - name: element
    type: integer (0, 2, or 8)
    properties:
      - value: integer
      - position: index within sequence
      - position_in_block: index within its block (if applicable)

actions:
  - name: iterate_sequence
    input: input_sequence
    output: output_sequence
    description: Processes the input sequence element by element or block by block.
  - name: identify_blocks
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of block_of_twos objects
    description: Finds all consecutive blocks of 2s and determines if they are qualifying.
  - name: transform_block
    input: qualifying block_of_twos, block_length
    output: subsequence of transformed elements (8s and 2s)
    description: |
      Applies rules based on element position within the block and block length:
      - Position 0 -> 8
      - Position 1 -> 8 if length >= 4, else 2
      - Position 2 -> 8 if length >= 6, else 2
      - Position >= 3 -> 2
  - name: copy_element
    input: element (0 or non-qualifying 2)
    output: element (appended to output sequence)
    description: Copies elements that are not part of a transformation rule directly to the output.
