Okay, let's analyze the transformation.

**Perception of the Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
2.  **Values:** The input sequences contain only the digits `0` and `2`. The output sequences contain `0`, `2`, and `8`.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change observed is the transformation of certain `2`s in the input sequence into `8`s in the output sequence. The digit `0` remains unchanged. No `8`s appear in the input.
4.  **Context Dependency:** Whether a `2` transforms into an `8` depends on its position within the sequence, specifically its relationship to preceding elements and its position within consecutive blocks of `2`s.
5.  **Group Behavior:** The transformation seems to operate on consecutive groups (or blocks) of `2`s. A group is defined as one or more adjacent `2`s. The transformation rule applies specifically to groups that are either at the very beginning of the sequence or immediately follow a `0`.
6.  **Length Dependency:** Within such a qualifying group of `2`s, the transformation of individual `2`s to `8`s depends on the total length of that consecutive group.
    *   The *first* `2` in the qualifying group always transforms to `8`.
    *   The *second* `2` in the qualifying group transforms to `8` only if the group's length is 4 or more.
    *   The *third* `2` in the qualifying group transforms to `8` only if the group's length is 6 or more.
    *   Subsequent `2`s within the group (fourth, fifth, etc.) always remain `2`.
7.  **Non-Qualifying `2`s:** Any `2` that is not the first, second (in a group >= 4), or third (in a group >= 6) element of a qualifying group remains a `2`. This includes `2`s within groups that start after another `2`.

**Facts:**


```python
import numpy as np

"""
Transform a sequence of 0s and 2s according to the following rules:
1. Iterate through the input sequence.
2. If an element is 0, copy it directly to the output.
3. If an element is 2, check if it is the start of a consecutive block of 2s. A block starts either at the beginning of the sequence or immediately after a 0.
4. If a 2 is the start of such a block:
   a. Determine the length of the consecutive block of 2s starting from this position.
   b. Apply transformations within this block based on position and block length:
      - The first 2 in the block always becomes 8.
      - The second 2 in the block becomes 8 if the block length is 4 or more.
      - The third 2 in the block becomes 8 if the block length is 6 or more.
      - All subsequent 2s (4th, 5th, etc.) within the block remain 2.
   c. Add the transformed (or original) values from the block to the output.
   d. Skip the already processed elements of the block in the main iteration.
5. If a 2 is encountered but it is *not* the start of a qualifying block (i.e., it follows another 2), copy it directly as 2 to the output.
6. Return the resulting sequence.
