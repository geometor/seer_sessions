            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the transformation.\n\n**Perception of the Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.\n2.  **Values:** The input sequences contain only the digits `0` and `2`. The output sequences contain `0`, `2`, and `8`.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change observed is the transformation of certain `2`s in the input sequence into `8`s in the output sequence. The digit `0` remains unchanged. No `8`s appear in the input.\n4.  **Context Dependency:** Whether a `2` transforms into an `8` depends on its position within the sequence, specifically its relationship to preceding elements and its position within consecutive blocks of `2`s.\n5.  **Group Behavior:** The transformation seems to operate on consecutive groups (or blocks) of `2`s. A group is defined as one or more adjacent `2`s. The transformation rule applies specifically to groups that are either at the very beginning of the sequence or immediately follow a `0`.\n6.  **Length Dependency:** Within such a qualifying group of `2`s, the transformation of individual `2`s to `8`s depends on the total length of that consecutive group.\n    *   The *first* `2` in the qualifying group always transforms to `8`.\n    *   The *second* `2` in the qualifying group transforms to `8` only if the group's length is 4 or more.\n    *   The *third* `2` in the qualifying group transforms to `8` only if the group's length is 6 or more.\n    *   Subsequent `2`s within the group (fourth, fifth, etc.) always remain `2`.\n7.  **Non-Qualifying `2`s:** Any `2` that is not the first, second (in a group >= 4), or third (in a group >= 6) element of a qualifying group remains a `2`. This includes `2`s within groups that start after another `2`.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
