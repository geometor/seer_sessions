"""
Transform a sequence of 0s and 2s according to the following rules:
1. Iterate through the input sequence.
2. If an element is 0, copy it directly to the output.
3. If an element is 2, check if it is the start of a consecutive block of 2s. A block starts either at the beginning of the sequence or immediately after a 0.
4. If a 2 is the start of such a block:
   a. Determine the length of the consecutive block of 2s starting from this position.
   b. Apply transformations within this block based on position and block length:
      - The first 2 in the block always becomes 8.
      - The second 2 in the block becomes 8 if the block length is 4 or more.
      - The third 2 in the block becomes 8 if the block length is 6 or more.
      - All subsequent 2s (4th, 5th, etc.) within the block remain 2.
   c. Add the transformed (or original) values from the block to the output.
   d. Skip the already processed elements of the block in the main iteration.
5. If a 2 is encountered but it is *not* the start of a qualifying block (i.e., it follows another 2), copy it directly as 2 to the output.
6. Return the resulting sequence.
