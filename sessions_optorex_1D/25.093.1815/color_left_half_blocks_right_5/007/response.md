"""
Transforms a sequence of digits (0s and 2s) based on the following rule:
Identify contiguous sub-sequences composed entirely of the digit '2'.
For each sub-sequence, check if it starts at the beginning of the main sequence (index 0) OR if the element immediately preceding it is '0'.
If this condition is met (the sub-sequence is "eligible"):
  Calculate N = floor(length of the eligible sub-sequence / 2).
  Change the first N elements of this eligible sub-sequence from '2' to '8' in the output.
All '0's, any '2's in non-eligible sub-sequences, and the '2's in the latter part (beyond the first N) of eligible sub-sequences remain unchanged.
The output sequence has the same length and format (list or numpy array) as the input.
