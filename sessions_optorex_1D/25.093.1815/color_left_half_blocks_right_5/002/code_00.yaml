Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: List[Integer] or np.ndarray[Integer] # Updated type
    description: Represents both the input and output data structure as a sequence of integers.
    properties:
        - length: Integer
  - name: Element
    type: Integer
    description: An individual item within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: Integer (0, 2, or 8)
      - index: Integer (position within the sequence)
  - name: SubSequence_of_2s
    type: List[Integer=2] # Implicitly a slice/view of the main Sequence
    description: A contiguous run of one or more '2's within the main Sequence.
    properties:
      - start_index: Integer
      - end_index: Integer # Inclusive index of the last '2' in the run
      - length: Integer
      - is_at_sequence_start: Boolean (True if start_index is 0)
      - is_preceded_by_0: Boolean (True if the element at start_index - 1 is 0)

Actions:
  - name: Initialize_Output
    description: Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence.
    inputs: Input_Sequence
    outputs: Output_Sequence
  - name: Iterate_and_Identify_SubSequences
    description: Scan the input Sequence to find contiguous runs of '2's and their properties (start index, length).
    inputs: Input_Sequence
    outputs: List[SubSequence_Properties (start_index, length)]
  - name: Check_Modification_Condition
    description: Determine if a SubSequence_of_2s meets the criteria for modification (starts sequence or follows a '0').
    inputs: SubSequence_start_index, Input_Sequence
    outputs: Boolean
  - name: Calculate_Modification_Count
    description: Determine how many '2's at the start of the qualifying sub-sequence should be changed.
    inputs: SubSequence_length
    outputs: Integer (N = floor(length / 2))
  - name: Modify_Output_Sequence
    description: Change the value of the first N Elements from 2 to 8 in the Output_Sequence for a qualifying SubSequence.
    inputs: Output_Sequence, SubSequence_start_index, Modification_Count
    outputs: Updated Output_Sequence

Relationships:
  - Zeros_Define_Boundaries: '0' elements or the start of the main Sequence define potential starting points for modifiable SubSequence_of_2s.
  - Modification_Scope: Modification (2 -> 8) applies only to the first floor(length / 2) elements of a SubSequence_of_2s that meets the start condition.
