            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe primary issue identified across all examples is a data type mismatch. The provided `transform` function expects a space-separated string as input (`input_str`) and uses the `.split()` method. However, the test environment appears to be passing the input as a NumPy array, which does not have a `.split()` method, leading to the `AttributeError`.\n\nThe underlying transformation logic, as described in the natural language program and implemented in the Python code (ignoring the input parsing), appears consistent with the input/output pairs when mentally traced. The core rule involves identifying contiguous blocks of '2's that either start the sequence or are preceded by a '0', and then changing the first `floor(length / 2)` of those '2's to '8's.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Adapt Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) of integers directly, removing the string parsing step (`input_str.split()`).\n2.  **Verify Logic:** Ensure the rest of the algorithm operates correctly using list/array indexing and manipulation.\n3.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the Fact Documentation and Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the input type (sequence of integers) and the transformation steps.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nSince the code failed before executing the core logic due to the input type error, traditional metrics like output comparison are not available. The key metric is the consistent error message:\n\n"
