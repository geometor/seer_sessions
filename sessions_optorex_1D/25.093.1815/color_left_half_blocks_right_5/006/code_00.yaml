Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: List[Integer]
    description: Represents the input and output data structure, a 1D list of integers.
    properties:
      - elements: List containing 0, 2, or 8.
      - length: Number of elements in the sequence.
  - name: Element
    type: Integer
    description: An individual digit within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: 0, 2, or 8
      - index: Position (Integer >= 0) within the sequence.
  - name: SubSequence_of_2s
    type: List[Integer=2]
    description: A contiguous run of one or more '2's within the main Sequence.
    properties:
      - start_index: Integer (index of the first '2' in the run)
      - length: Integer (number of '2's in the run)
  - name: Eligible_SubSequence_of_2s
    type: SubSequence_of_2s
    description: A SubSequence_of_2s that meets the criteria for modification.
    criteria:
      - The sub-sequence starts at index 0 of the main Sequence.
      - OR the element at index (start_index - 1) in the main Sequence has a value of 0.

Actions:
  - name: Parse_Input
    description: If input is a string, convert it into a Sequence (List[Integer]). Handles space separation.
    inputs: String
    outputs: Sequence
  - name: Identify_Eligible_SubSequences
    description: Iterate through the Sequence to find all Eligible_SubSequence_of_2s.
    inputs: Sequence
    outputs: List[Eligible_SubSequence_of_2s]
  - name: Calculate_Modification_Count
    description: For an Eligible_SubSequence_of_2s, determine how many initial elements to change.
    inputs: Eligible_SubSequence_of_2s
    outputs: Integer (N = floor(length / 2))
  - name: Apply_Transformation
    description: Create the output Sequence by changing the required '2's to '8's based on identified Eligible_SubSequences and calculated Modification Counts.
    inputs: Sequence, List[Eligible_SubSequence_of_2s]
    outputs: Modified Sequence (output)

Relationships:
  - Boundary_Condition: The start of the main Sequence or the presence of a '0' element defines the start condition for an Eligible_SubSequence_of_2s.
  - Modification_Rule: For each Eligible_SubSequence_of_2s, the first N = floor(length / 2) elements are changed from 2 to 8. Elements '0' and non-eligible '2's remain unchanged.
