**General Assessment and Strategy**

The previous execution results showed that the generated code failed to produce the correct output for any of the training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input in every case, indicating that the core transformation logic (changing '2's to '8's) was never triggered.

Analysis suggests the most likely reason for this failure was a mismatch between the expected input format of the `transform` function (a list or numpy array of integers) and the actual format potentially used during testing (a single string of space-separated digits). The code logic itself, when manually traced or tested with correctly parsed input (as demonstrated by the `analyze_transformation` tool code execution), appears sound and correctly implements the observed pattern.

The strategy is to:
1.  Re-confirm the transformation rule using the detailed analysis from the tool code.
2.  Update the YAML fact documentation to be precise.
3.  Refine the natural language program to clearly state the rule, assuming the input requires initial parsing from a string format if necessary, or works directly on a sequence of integers.
4.  Provide a corrected code implementation that handles potential string input format robustly.

**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**

The `analyze_transformation` tool code was executed to verify the transformation rule against all training examples, assuming the input is a space-separated string that needs parsing into a list of integers.

**Summary:** The analysis confirms that the rule consistently applies to all training examples. The calculated outputs match the expected outputs perfectly. The modifications involve changing the first `floor(length / 2)` elements of a contiguous sequence of '2's to '8's, but *only if* that sequence starts at index 0 or is immediately preceded by a '0'.

**Natural Language Program**

1.  **Input Processing:** Accept the input, which is a sequence of digits (potentially represented as a space-separated string). If it's a string, parse it into a list of integers. Let this be the `input_sequence`.
2.  **Initialization:** Create a copy of the `input_sequence` called `output_sequence`.
3.  **Iteration and Identification:** Iterate through the `input_sequence` using an index `i`, from start to end.
4.  **Condition Check:** At each index `i`, check if the element `input_sequence[i]` is equal to `2`.
5.  **Eligibility Check:** If the element is `2`, determine if it marks the beginning of an "eligible" sub-sequence. A sub-sequence starting at `i` is eligible if:
    *   `i` is 0 (it's the start of the entire sequence), OR
    *   `i` is greater than 0 AND the preceding element `input_sequence[i-1]` is `0`.
6.  **Process Eligible Sub-sequence:** If the sub-sequence starting at `i` is eligible:
    a.  **Measure Length:** Determine the length (`current_len`) of the contiguous block of `2`s starting from index `i`.
    b.  **Calculate Changes:** Calculate the number of elements to change, `N = floor(current_len / 2)`.
    c.  **Modify Output:** In the `output_sequence`, change the value of the elements from index `i` up to (but not including) index `i + N` from `2` to `8`.
    d.  **Advance Index:** Update the main iteration index `i` by adding `current_len` to it, effectively skipping over the sub-sequence that was just processed. Continue to the next iteration of the main loop (Step 3).
7.  **Process Non-Eligible/Other Elements:** If the element at index `i` is not `2`, or if it is `2` but does not start an eligible sub-sequence, simply increment the index `i` by 1 and continue to the next iteration (Step 3).
8.  **Output Generation:** Once the iteration is complete, the `output_sequence` contains the transformed result. If the desired output format is a string, convert the list of integers back into a space-separated string. Return the final result.
