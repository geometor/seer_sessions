            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe previous execution results showed that the generated code failed to produce the correct output for any of the training examples. The transformed output was identical to the input in every case, indicating that the core transformation logic (changing '2's to '8's) was never triggered.\n\nAnalysis suggests the most likely reason for this failure was a mismatch between the expected input format of the `transform` function (a list or numpy array of integers) and the actual format potentially used during testing (a single string of space-separated digits). The code logic itself, when manually traced or tested with correctly parsed input (as demonstrated by the `analyze_transformation` tool code execution), appears sound and correctly implements the observed pattern.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-confirm the transformation rule using the detailed analysis from the tool code.\n2.  Update the YAML fact documentation to be precise.\n3.  Refine the natural language program to clearly state the rule, assuming the input requires initial parsing from a string format if necessary, or works directly on a sequence of integers.\n4.  Provide a corrected code implementation that handles potential string input format robustly.\n\n**Metrics Gathering and Analysis**\n\nThe `analyze_transformation` tool code was executed to verify the transformation rule against all training examples, assuming the input is a space-separated string that needs parsing into a list of integers.\n\n"

If it's a string, parse it into a list of integers.

A sub-sequence starting at `i` is eligible if:\n    *   `i` is 0 (it's the start of the entire sequence), OR\n    *   `i` is greater than 0 AND the preceding element `input_sequence[i-1]` is `0`.\n6.  **Process Eligible Sub-sequence:** If the sub-sequence starting at `i` is eligible:\n    a.  **Measure Length:** Determine the length (`current_len`) of the contiguous block of `2`s starting from index `i`.\n    b.  **Calculate Changes:** Calculate the number of elements to change, `N = floor(current_len / 2)`.\n    c.  **Modify Output:** In the `output_sequence`, change the value of the elements from index `i` up to (but not including) index `i + N` from `2` to `8`.\n    d.  **Advance Index:** Update the main iteration index `i` by adding `current_len` to it, effectively skipping over the sub-sequence that was just processed.
