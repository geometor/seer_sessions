"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on the following rules:
1. Identify contiguous sub-sequences composed entirely of the digit '2'.
2. For each identified sub-sequence of '2's:
   a. Check if the sub-sequence starts at the beginning of the main sequence (index 0) OR if the element immediately preceding it is '0'.
   b. If the condition in (a) is true:
      i. Calculate N = floor(length of the sub-sequence / 2).
      ii. Change the first N elements of this sub-sequence from '2' to '8'.
3. All '0's and any '2's not meeting the criteria or not within the first N elements of a qualifying sub-sequence remain unchanged.
4. The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
