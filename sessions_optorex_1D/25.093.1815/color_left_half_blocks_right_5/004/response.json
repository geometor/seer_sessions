            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe provided execution results for `code_00.py` indicate a complete failure to apply the intended transformation rule. In every example (training and test), the \"Transformed Output\" is identical to the \"Input\". This suggests the code that was executed either had a fundamental flaw preventing any modification (e.g., always returning the input copy, error in the modification logic) or was not the same as the corrected Python code (`transform(input_grid)`) presented later in the prompt.\n\nHowever, the natural language program developed initially and the corrected Python code (`transform(input_grid)`) appear to correctly describe the transformation rule observed in the input/expected output pairs based on manual tracing. The rule involves identifying contiguous sequences of '2's that either start the main sequence or follow a '0', and then changing the first half (rounded down) of those '2's to '8's.\n\nThe strategy is to proceed assuming the natural language program and the corrected code block accurately represent the task's requirements. The failure reported in the execution results is likely due to an error in the specific version of the code tested (`code_00.py`), not an error in the understanding of the rule itself.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics quantify the difference between the *expected* output and the *reported* output from `code_00.py` (which was identical to the input). The \"Differences\" count represents the number of '2's that should have been transformed into '8's according to the rule.\n\n"
