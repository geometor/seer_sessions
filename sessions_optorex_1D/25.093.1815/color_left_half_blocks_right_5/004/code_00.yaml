Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: List[Digit]
    description: Represents the input and output data structure, a list of digits.
    properties:
      - length: Integer
      - elements: List[Element]
  - name: Element
    type: Digit
    description: An individual item within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: Integer (0, 2 for input; 0, 2, 8 for output)
      - index: Integer (position within the sequence, 0-based)
  - name: SubSequence_of_2s
    type: List[Element]
    description: A contiguous run of one or more Elements with value '2' within the main Sequence.
    properties:
      - start_index: Integer
      - end_index: Integer
      - length: Integer
      - elements: List[Element]
  - name: Boundary_Condition
    type: Boolean
    description: Condition that determines if a SubSequence_of_2s is eligible for modification. It is TRUE if the sub-sequence starts at index 0 OR if the element at index (start_index - 1) has a value of 0.

Actions:
  - name: Identify_SubSequences_of_2s
    description: Scan the input Sequence to find all contiguous runs of '2's.
    inputs: Sequence
    outputs: List[SubSequence_of_2s]
  - name: Check_Boundary_Condition
    description: Determine if a SubSequence_of_2s meets the Boundary_Condition.
    inputs: SubSequence_of_2s, Sequence
    outputs: Boolean
  - name: Calculate_Modification_Count
    description: Determine how many '2's at the start of an eligible sub-sequence should be changed to '8'.
    inputs: SubSequence_of_2s
    outputs: Integer (N = floor(length / 2))
  - name: Modify_Elements
    description: Change the value of the first N Elements of an eligible SubSequence_of_2s from 2 to 8 in the output sequence.
    inputs: Output_Sequence, SubSequence_of_2s, Modification_Count (N)
    outputs: Modified Output_Sequence

Relationships:
  - Zeros_Define_Boundaries: '0' elements act as separators between potential SubSequence_of_2s runs, affecting the Boundary_Condition.
  - Modification_Dependency: The transformation of an Element (2 -> 8) depends on:
      1. Its membership in a SubSequence_of_2s.
      2. That sub-sequence satisfying the Boundary_Condition.
      3. Its position within the first 'N' elements of that sub-sequence, where N = floor(length / 2).
