Identify contiguous sub-sequences composed entirely of the digit '2'.\n2. For each identified sub-sequence of '2's:\n   a. Check if the sub-sequence starts at the beginning of the main sequence (index 0) OR if the element immediately preceding it is '0'.\n   b. If the condition in (a) is true:\n      i. Calculate N = floor(length of the sub-sequence / 2).\n      ii. Change the first N elements of this sub-sequence from '2' to '8'.\n3. All '0's and any '2's not meeting the criteria or not within the first N elements of a qualifying sub-sequence remain unchanged.\n4.
