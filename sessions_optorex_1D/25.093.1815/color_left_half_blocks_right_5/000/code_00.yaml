Objects:
  - name: Sequence
    type: List[Digit]
    description: Represents both the input and output data structure.
  - name: Element
    type: Digit
    description: An individual item within the sequence.
    properties:
      - value: Integer (0, 2, or 8)
      - index: Integer (position within the sequence)
  - name: SubSequence_of_2s
    type: List[Digit=2]
    description: A contiguous run of one or more '2's within the main Sequence.
    properties:
      - start_index: Integer
      - end_index: Integer
      - length: Integer
      - is_at_sequence_start: Boolean (True if start_index is 0)
      - is_preceded_by_0: Boolean (True if the element at start_index - 1 is 0)

Actions:
  - name: Identify_SubSequences_of_2s
    description: Scan the input Sequence to find all contiguous runs of '2's.
    inputs: Sequence
    outputs: List[SubSequence_of_2s]
  - name: Check_Condition
    description: Determine if a SubSequence_of_2s meets the criteria for modification.
    inputs: SubSequence_of_2s, Sequence
    outputs: Boolean (True if is_at_sequence_start or is_preceded_by_0)
  - name: Calculate_Modification_Count
    description: Determine how many '2's at the start of the sub-sequence should be changed.
    inputs: SubSequence_of_2s
    outputs: Integer (N = floor(length / 2))
  - name: Modify_Elements
    description: Change the value of specific Elements from 2 to 8.
    inputs: Sequence, List[Indices_to_modify]
    outputs: Modified Sequence

Relationships:
  - Zeros_Separate_Subsequences: '0' elements or the start/end of the main Sequence define the boundaries of SubSequence_of_2s.
  - Modification_Dependency: The modification of an Element (2 -> 8) depends on its membership in a SubSequence_of_2s, whether that sub-sequence meets the start/preceded_by_0 condition, and the sub-sequence's length.
