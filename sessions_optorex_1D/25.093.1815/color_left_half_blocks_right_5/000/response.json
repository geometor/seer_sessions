The digits observed are 0, 2, and 8.\n2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change is the transformation of some digits '2' into '8'. The digit '0' remains unchanged in all examples.\n3.  **Sequence Integrity:** The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence. The relative order of elements that don't change is preserved.\n4.  **Role of '0':** The digit '0' appears to act as a boundary or separator. The transformation of '2's seems to depend on their position relative to '0's or the start of the sequence.\n5.  **Pattern:** The transformation doesn't apply to all '2's. It specifically targets the beginning elements of contiguous groups (sub-sequences) of '2's, but only if that group starts the main sequence or is immediately preceded by a '0'. The number of '2's changed within such a group depends on the group's length.\n\n**Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
