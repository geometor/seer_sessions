Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Data:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits (specifically 0 and 2 in the input, and 0, 2, and 8 in the output), presented as space-separated strings.
*   **Core Transformation:** The digit `2` is sometimes transformed into the digit `8`, while the digit `0` remains unchanged.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** The transformation of `2` to `8` does not happen for every `2`. It appears to depend on the context, specifically how many consecutive `2`s are present together. Observing the examples, the changes occur within contiguous blocks of `2`s.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify all contiguous blocks composed solely of the digit `2`. These blocks are separated by the digit `0` or the start/end of the sequence.
3.  For each identified block of `2`s:
    a.  Determine the length of the block, let this be `k`.
    b.  Calculate the number of `2`s to change: `num_to_change = floor(k / 2)`.
    c.  Replace the first `num_to_change` digits (`2`) within that block with the digit `8`.
    d.  Keep the remaining `k - num_to_change` digits (`2`) in the block unchanged.
4.  Keep all digits `0` in their original positions.
5.  Construct the output sequence by combining the unchanged `0`s and the modified blocks of `2`s/`8`s in their original order.
6.  Format the output sequence as a space-separated string.

**General Assessment and Strategy:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: contiguous blocks of `2`s have their first half (rounded down) changed to `8`s, while `0`s remain unchanged. However, the implementation assumed the input was a space-separated string, leading to a `TypeError` because the actual input provided during testing was a NumPy array.

The strategy is to:
1.  Modify the input handling of the `transform` function to accept a sequence of integers (like a NumPy array or a list) directly, eliminating the string splitting (`.split()`).
2.  Maintain the core logic for identifying blocks of `2`s and applying the transformation rule (`floor(k/2)` elements changed to `8`).
3.  Adjust the output format. Since the input is an array, the function should likely return a sequence of integers (e.g., a list or a NumPy array). Returning a list is a safe default.
4.  Update the documentation (`facts.yaml` and natural language program) to reflect the input/output data types accurately as sequences of integers.

**Metrics and Data Analysis:**

The error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred consistently across all 7 training examples and the single test example provided in the previous step's feedback. This confirms the input type is consistently a NumPy array, not a string. The core logic, when simulated manually or with corrected code (as shown in the thought block), appears to produce the correct output sequences for the given examples when applied to the array elements.

*   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers.
*   **Output Type (Expected by Test Harness):** Likely a NumPy array or list of integers. The error was triggered *before* the return statement, specifically at the `.split()` call.
*   **Transformation Logic Validity:** The rule of transforming the first `floor(k/2)` elements of a block of `k` twos to `8`s remains consistent with all provided input/output pairs.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence (list or array) of integers.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence to store the results.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index.
4.  If the element at the current index is `2`:
    a.  Record the starting index of this potential block of `2`s.
    b.  Continue iterating forward as long as the elements are `2`, counting the length (`k`) of the block.
    c.  Once the block ends (either by encountering a `0` or the end of the sequence), calculate the number of `2`s to change: `num_to_change = floor(k / 2)`.
    d.  In the result sequence, replace the values from the block's starting index up to `start_index + num_to_change - 1` with `8`.
    e.  Ensure the loop index is positioned correctly after the processed block to continue searching for the next block.
5.  If the element at the current index is `0`, leave the corresponding element in the result sequence unchanged and move to the next index.
6.  Return the modified sequence (e.g., as a list of integers).
