"""
Transforms a sequence of integers (0s and 2s) based on contiguous blocks of the value 2.
For each contiguous block of k twos, the first floor(k / 2) twos are changed to 8,
while the remaining twos stay as 2. Zeros remain unchanged. The input is expected 
to be a sequence (like a list or NumPy array) of integers, and the output will be 
a list of integers.

    Applies the block-based transformation rule (2 -> 8 for first floor(k/2))
