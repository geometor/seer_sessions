## General Assessment

The provided information includes multiple examples of input-output pairs for a sequence transformation task, along with the results of executing a previously generated Python function (`code_00.py`) on these examples.

The execution results consistently show that the provided code failed to perform *any* transformation, returning the original input sequence as the output in all cases. However, a manual step-through of the examples reveals a clear and consistent pattern: contiguous blocks of the digit `2` are modified, while the digit `0` remains unchanged. Specifically, within a block of `k` consecutive `2`s, the first `floor(k/2)` digits are changed to `8`, and the remaining `2`s in that block are left as `2`. This rule perfectly matches all provided input/output pairs.

The discrepancy between the observed pattern (which seems correct and is implemented in the natural language program) and the execution failure suggests that the error lies not in the *understanding* of the transformation rule, but potentially in the *implementation* within `code_00.py` or possibly in the testing environment's handling of input/output types (e.g., string vs. list of integers) when calling the function.

The strategy moving forward is to:
1.  Verify the `floor(k/2)` rule against all examples using code execution for metric gathering.
2.  Refine the YAML description and natural language program based on this confirmed rule, ensuring clarity.
3.  Acknowledge the previous code's failure but maintain confidence in the derived transformation logic, implying the next coding phase should focus on correctly implementing this specific logic.

## Metrics Gathering

The following code analyzes each input example to identify blocks of `2`s and calculate the expected number of transformations to `8` based on the `floor(k/2)` rule. It compares this calculation to the number of `8`s present in the corresponding expected output.

**Metrics Analysis:**
The code execution confirms that for every example (training and test), the number of `8`s expected in the output perfectly matches the number calculated by applying the `floor(k/2)` rule to each block of `2`s found in the input. This strongly validates the identified transformation rule.

      - Calculate the number of twos to change: `num_to_change = floor(k / 2)`.
      - The first `num_to_change` digits (at indices `start` to `start + num_to_change - 1`) are changed from 2 to 8.
      - The remaining `k - num_to_change` digits (at indices `start + num_to_change` to `start + k - 1`) remain as 2.
  unchanged_elements: Digits with value 0 are kept in their original positions.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input string into a sequence (list) of integers.
2.  Create a new sequence (list) as a copy of the input sequence to store the results.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index variable, `i`.
4.  If the element at index `i` is `0`, advance the index `i` and continue to the next element.
5.  If the element at index `i` is `2`:
    a.  Mark this index `i` as the `start_index` of a potential block of `2`s.
    b.  Initialize a counter `block_length` to 0.
    c.  Continue iterating from `start_index` as long as the index is within the sequence bounds AND the element is `2`. Increment `block_length` and the current iteration index for each `2` found in the block. Let the final iteration index (pointing just past the block) be stored back into `i`.
    d.  Calculate the number of `2`s to change to `8`: `num_to_change = floor(block_length / 2)`.
    e.  In the *result* sequence (the copy), change the value from `2` to `8` for elements from `start_index` up to (`start_index + num_to_change - 1`).
    f.  The elements from index `start_index + num_to_change` to `start_index + block_length - 1` in the result sequence remain `2` (they are already `2` in the copy).
    g. The main loop should resume iteration from the index `i` (which is already positioned after the processed block).
6.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, convert the elements of the result sequence back to strings.
7.  Join the string elements with spaces to form the final output string.
