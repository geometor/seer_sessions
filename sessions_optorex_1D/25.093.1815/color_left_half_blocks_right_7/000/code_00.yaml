task_description: "Transform a sequence of digits based on contiguous blocks of the digit 2."
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of digits (integers)
      - allowed_input_digits: [0, 2]
      - allowed_output_digits: [0, 2, 8]
  - object: digit_0
    properties:
      - value: 0
    actions:
      - remains unchanged in the output.
  - object: digit_2
    properties:
      - value: 2
    actions:
      - may be transformed to 8 based on context.
      - may remain 2 based on context.
  - object: block_of_2s
    properties:
      - definition: A contiguous subsequence consisting only of the digit 2.
      - length: k (number of 2s in the block)
    relationships:
      - separated by digit 0 or sequence boundaries.
transformation_rule:
  condition: Applies to blocks of consecutive 2s.
  action:
    - For a block of k twos:
      - The first 'floor(k / 2)' twos are changed to 8.
      - The remaining 'k - floor(k / 2)' twos remain 2.
  scope: Applied independently to each block of 2s.
