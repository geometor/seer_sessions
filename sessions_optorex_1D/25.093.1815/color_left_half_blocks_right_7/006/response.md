**Assessment of Information and Strategy:**

The provided information shows a consistent failure across all training and test examples. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string input (using `.strip()` and `.split()`), but it is being called with a NumPy array in the testing environment.

The strategy is to modify the function to directly accept a sequence of integers (like a list or NumPy array) as input, eliminating the string parsing step. The core transformation logic (identifying blocks of 2s and modifying them) appears sound based on the initial examples and should be preserved. The output format also needs clarification; assuming the test harness expects a list or array of integers as output, the string formatting step should also be removed.

**Metrics:**

*   **Execution Status:** Failed for all 7 training examples and the 1 provided test example.
*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` in all cases.
*   **Cause:** Input type mismatch. The function expected a string but received a NumPy array.
*   **Core Logic Validation:** The core transformation logic (block identification and modification) was not reached due to the input handling error.

```yaml
task_description: "Transform a sequence of integers based on contiguous blocks of the value 2."
elements:
  - object: input_sequence
    properties:
      - type: Sequence of integers (e.g., list, numpy array)
      - allowed_values: [0, 2]
  - object: output_sequence
    properties:
      - type: List of integers
      - allowed_values: [0, 2, 8]
      - preserves_length_of: input_sequence
  - object: value_0
    properties:
      - integer: 0
    actions:
      - remains unchanged in its position.
  - object: value_2
    properties:
      - integer: 2
    actions:
      - may be transformed to 8 based on block context.
      - may remain 2 based on block context.
  - object: block_of_2s
    properties:
      - definition: A contiguous subsequence consisting only of the value 2.
      - length: k (number of 2s in the block)
    relationships:
      - separated by value 0 or sequence boundaries.
transformation_rule:
  condition: Applies to contiguous blocks of the value 2 within the input sequence.
  action:
    - For each block of k twos found:
      - Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_to_change = floor(k / 2)`.
      - Change the first `num_to_change` values (2s) within that block to 8.
      - The remaining `k - num_to_change` values (2s) in the block remain 2.
  scope: Applied independently to each block, preserving the position of 0s and the overall sequence length.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence of integers (e.g., a list or NumPy array).
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence to serve as the output sequence.
3.  Initialize an index variable `i` to 0 to track the current position while scanning the sequence.
4.  Iterate through the sequence using the index `i`:
    a.  If the element at the current index `i` is `2`:
        i.  Record the starting index of this block (`start_index = i`).
        ii. Initialize a counter for the block length (`block_length = 0`).
        iii. Continue scanning forward from `i` as long as the index is within the sequence bounds and the element is `2`. Increment `block_length` and the scanning index (`i`) for each `2` found.
        iv. Once the block ends (either a `0` is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached), calculate the number of `2`s to change to `8`: `num_to_change = block_length // 2` (using integer division for floor).
        v.  Modify the output sequence: Iterate from `start_index` up to (`start_index + num_to_change`). In each position `j` within this range, set the element in the output sequence to `8`.
        vi. The main loop index `i` is already positioned at the element immediately following the processed block, so the loop will continue correctly.
    b.  If the element at the current index `i` is `0`, simply increment the index `i` to move to the next element.
5.  Once the iteration completes, return the modified output sequence (as a list of integers).
