            "text": "**Assessment of Information and Strategy:**\n\nThe provided information shows a consistent failure across all training and test examples. The error message `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` clearly indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string input (using `.strip()` and `.split()`), but it is being called with a NumPy array in the testing environment.\n\nThe strategy is to modify the function to directly accept a sequence of integers (like a list or NumPy array) as input, eliminating the string parsing step. The core transformation logic (identifying blocks of 2s and modifying them) appears sound based on the initial examples and should be preserved. The output format also needs clarification; assuming the test harness expects a list or array of integers as output, the string formatting step should also be removed.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n*   **Execution Status:** Failed for all 7 training examples and the 1 provided test example.\n*   **Error Type:** `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'` in all cases.\n*   **Cause:** Input type mismatch. The function expected a string but received a NumPy array.\n*   **Core Logic Validation:** The core transformation logic (block identification and modification) was not reached due to the input handling error.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
