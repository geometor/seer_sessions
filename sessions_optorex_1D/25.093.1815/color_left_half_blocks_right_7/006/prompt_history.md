Okay, analyzing the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Input/Output Data:** Both input and output are sequences of single digits (specifically 0 and 2 in the input, and 0, 2, and 8 in the output), presented as space-separated strings.
*   **Core Transformation:** The digit `2` is sometimes transformed into the digit `8`, while the digit `0` remains unchanged.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** The transformation of `2` to `8` does not happen for every `2`. It appears to depend on the context, specifically how many consecutive `2`s are present together. Observing the examples, the changes occur within contiguous blocks of `2`s.

**Facts (YAML):**


```yaml
task_description: "Transform a sequence of digits based on contiguous blocks of the digit 2."
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of digits (integers)
      - allowed_input_digits: [0, 2]
      - allowed_output_digits: [0, 2, 8]
  - object: digit_0
    properties:
      - value: 0
    actions:
      - remains unchanged in the output.
  - object: digit_2
    properties:
      - value: 2
    actions:
      - may be transformed to 8 based on context.
      - may remain 2 based on context.
  - object: block_of_2s
    properties:
      - definition: A contiguous subsequence consisting only of the digit 2.
      - length: k (number of 2s in the block)
    relationships:
      - separated by digit 0 or sequence boundaries.
transformation_rule:
  condition: Applies to blocks of consecutive 2s.
  action:
    - For a block of k twos:
      - The first 'floor(k / 2)' twos are changed to 8.
      - The remaining 'k - floor(k / 2)' twos remain 2.
  scope: Applied independently to each block of 2s.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence of digits.
2.  Identify all contiguous blocks composed solely of the digit `2`. These blocks are separated by the digit `0` or the start/end of the sequence.
3.  For each identified block of `2`s:
    a.  Determine the length of the block, let this be `k`.
    b.  Calculate the number of `2`s to change: `num_to_change = floor(k / 2)`.
    c.  Replace the first `num_to_change` digits (`2`) within that block with the digit `8`.
    d.  Keep the remaining `k - num_to_change` digits (`2`) in the block unchanged.
4.  Keep all digits `0` in their original positions.
5.  Construct the output sequence by combining the unchanged `0`s and the modified blocks of `2`s/`8`s in their original order.
6.  Format the output sequence as a space-separated string.
