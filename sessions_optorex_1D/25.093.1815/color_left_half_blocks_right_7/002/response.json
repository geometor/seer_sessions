            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation rule: contiguous blocks of `2`s have their first half (rounded down) changed to `8`s, while `0`s remain unchanged. However, the implementation assumed the input was a space-separated string, leading to a `TypeError` because the actual input provided during testing was a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Modify the input handling of the `transform` function to accept a sequence of integers (like a NumPy array or a list) directly, eliminating the string splitting (`.split()`).\n2.  Maintain the core logic for identifying blocks of `2`s and applying the transformation rule (`floor(k/2)` elements changed to `8`).\n3.  Adjust the output format. Since the input is an array, the function should likely return a sequence of integers (e.g., a list or a NumPy array). Returning a list is a safe default.\n4.  Update the documentation (`facts.yaml` and natural language program) to reflect the input/output data types accurately as sequences of integers.\n\n**Metrics and Data Analysis:**\n\nThe error `'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` occurred consistently across all 7 training examples and the single test example provided in the previous step's feedback. This confirms the input type is consistently a NumPy array, not a string. The core logic, when simulated manually or with corrected code (as shown in the thought block), appears to produce the correct output sequences for the given examples when applied to the array elements.\n\n*   **Input Type:** NumPy array of integers.\n*   **Output Type (Expected by Test Harness):** Likely a NumPy array or list of integers. The error was triggered *before* the return statement, specifically at the `.split()` call.\n*   **Transformation Logic Validity:** The rule of transforming the first `floor(k/2)` elements of a block of `k` twos to `8`s remains consistent with all provided input/output pairs.\n\n**Facts (YAML):**\n\n"
