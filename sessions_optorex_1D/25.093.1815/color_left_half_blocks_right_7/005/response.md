Transforms a sequence of digits (0s and 2s) represented as a space-separated 
string. For each contiguous block of 'k' twos found in the sequence, 
the first floor(k / 2) twos in that block are changed to 8, while the 
remaining twos in the block stay as 2. Zeros remain unchanged. The output 
is returned as a space-separated string.
