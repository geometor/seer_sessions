objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers (0 or 2)
    properties:
      - length: N
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers (0, 2, or 8)
    properties:
      - length: N (same as input)
  - name: contiguous_subsequence_of_twos
    type: A maximal run of consecutive '2's within the input_sequence.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index where the subsequence begins.
      - end_index: The index where the subsequence ends.
      - length: L = end_index - start_index + 1
actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    description: Create an initial output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
  - name: find_two_subsequences
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to identify all maximal contiguous subsequences of '2's.
  - name: modify_subsequence_in_output
    description: For each identified subsequence of '2's with length L starting at index S:
      1. Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_changes = L // 2` (integer division).
      2. For indices `k` from `S` up to `S + num_changes - 1`, set `output_sequence[k]` to 8.
      3. The remaining elements of the subsequence (from index `S + num_changes` to `end_index`) and all '0' elements retain their original values due to the initial copy.
