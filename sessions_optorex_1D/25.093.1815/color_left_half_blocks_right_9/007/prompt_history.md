**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers (specifically 0s and 2s) into another sequence of the same length, containing 0s, 2s, and 8s. The transformation rule appears to operate locally, focusing on consecutive runs of the digit '2'. The digit '0' seems to remain unchanged in all positions. The digit '2' is sometimes changed to '8', and sometimes remains '2'. The change from '2' to '8' depends on the position of the '2' within a contiguous block of '2's. Specifically, for any consecutive sequence of '2's of length N, the first `floor(N / 2)` elements are transformed into '8's, while the subsequent elements in that sequence remain '2's.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains digits 0 and 2
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains digits 0, 2, and 8
      - same length as input_sequence
  - name: subsequence_of_twos
    type: contiguous block of '2's within the input sequence
    properties:
      - length: N (integer > 0)
actions:
  - name: identify_subsequences
    description: Find all maximal contiguous subsequences composed entirely of the digit '2' in the input sequence.
  - name: transform_subsequence
    description: For each identified subsequence of '2's with length N, change the first floor(N / 2) elements from '2' to '8'.
  - name: copy_elements
    description: Elements in the input sequence that are '0' or are '2's not part of the first floor(N/2) elements of a subsequence remain unchanged in the output sequence.
relationships:
  - The transformation of an element depends on its value and its position within a consecutive run of identical elements ('2's).
  - The number of '2's changed to '8's within a subsequence is determined by the integer division of the subsequence length (N) by 2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence, identifying the start and end indices of all maximal contiguous subsequences consisting solely of the digit '2'. Keep track of the indices that belong to these subsequences.
3.  For each identified subsequence of '2's starting at index `start`, ending at index `end`, and having length `N = end - start + 1`:
    a.  Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_to_change = N // 2` (integer division).
    b.  For the first `num_to_change` elements within this subsequence (from index `start` to `start + num_to_change - 1`), set the corresponding elements in the output sequence to '8'.
    c.  For the remaining elements within this subsequence (from index `start + num_to_change` to `end`), set the corresponding elements in the output sequence to '2'.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence again. For any element at an index `i` that was *not* part of any identified subsequence of '2's (meaning the input element must be '0'), copy the input element to the corresponding position `i` in the output sequence.
5.  Return the completed output sequence.

**General Assessment and Strategy**

The analysis indicates that the initial perception of the transformation rule was correct. The provided examples consistently show that contiguous subsequences of the digit '2' are modified based on their length (N), with the first `floor(N/2)` elements changing to '8' and the rest remaining '2'. The digit '0' remains unchanged.

The previous code attempt (`code_00.py`) failed entirely, returning the input sequence unchanged for all examples. This strongly suggests an implementation error or an issue within the execution environment that prevented the intended modifications, rather than a flaw in the discerned logic.

The strategy moving forward is:
1.  Reaffirm the transformation rule based on the consistent pattern observed across all examples.
2.  Refine the natural language program for clarity, ensuring it precisely describes the steps needed.
3.  Instruct the coder phase to focus on a robust implementation that correctly modifies the output sequence according to the rule, paying close attention to list/array manipulation and copying.

The metrics confirm that the number of '2's changed to '8's (`calculated_total_changes`) in each example matches the number of positions where the input differs from the expected output (`mismatched_pixels_expected`). This validates the identified rule.

```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers (0 or 2)
    properties:
      - length: N
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers (0, 2, or 8)
    properties:
      - length: N (same as input)
  - name: contiguous_subsequence_of_twos
    type: A maximal run of consecutive '2's within the input_sequence.
    properties:
      - start_index: The index where the subsequence begins.
      - end_index: The index where the subsequence ends.
      - length: L = end_index - start_index + 1
actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    description: Create an initial output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
  - name: find_two_subsequences
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to identify all maximal contiguous subsequences of '2's.
  - name: modify_subsequence_in_output
    description: For each identified subsequence of '2's with length L starting at index S:
      1. Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_changes = L // 2` (integer division).
      2. For indices `k` from `S` up to `S + num_changes - 1`, set `output_sequence[k]` to 8.
      3. The remaining elements of the subsequence (from index `S + num_changes` to `end_index`) and all '0' elements retain their original values due to the initial copy.
```


**Natural Language Program**

1.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence, which will serve as the basis for the output sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index variable, say `i`, starting from 0 up to the length of the sequence minus 1.
3.  If the element at the current index `i` in the *input* sequence is '2':
    a.  Identify this as the start of a contiguous subsequence of '2's.
    b.  Find the end index of this subsequence by advancing another index, say `j`, as long as the element at `j` is '2' and `j` is within the bounds of the sequence. The end index will be `j-1`.
    c.  Calculate the length `L` of this subsequence.
    d.  Calculate the number of elements to change to '8': `num_changes = L // 2`.
    e.  Iterate from the `start_index` (`i`) up to `start_index + num_changes - 1`. For each index `k` in this range, update the element at index `k` in the *output* sequence to '8'.
    f.  Advance the main loop index `i` to be one position *after* the end of the identified subsequence (i.e., set `i = j`) to avoid reprocessing parts of the same subsequence.
4.  If the element at the current index `i` in the *input* sequence is '0', simply advance the main loop index `i` by 1 (`i = i + 1`). The '0' is already correctly placed in the output sequence due to the initial copy.
5.  After iterating through the entire input sequence, return the modified output sequence.
