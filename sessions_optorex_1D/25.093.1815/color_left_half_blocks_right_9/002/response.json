            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code failed across all examples due to a type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string as input and parse it into a list of integers using `.split()`. However, the testing environment passed the input as a NumPy array, which does not have a `.split()` method, resulting in an `AttributeError`.\n\nThe underlying logic for the transformation, identified in the previous step (changing the first `floor(N/2)` elements of any contiguous subsequence of '2's of length N to '8'), appears correct based on visual inspection of all provided input/output pairs. The strategy is to modify the input handling of the function to accept a list or array-like structure of integers directly, removing the string parsing step. The core transformation logic will remain the same.\n\n**Metrics:**\n\nAll 7 training examples and the 1 test example failed with the identical error: `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`. This consistently indicates that the input data type provided during testing was a NumPy array, while the function expected a string. No execution using `tool_code` is necessary as the error message is self-explanatory and consistent. Visual inspection confirms the transformation rule derived previously holds for all examples.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
