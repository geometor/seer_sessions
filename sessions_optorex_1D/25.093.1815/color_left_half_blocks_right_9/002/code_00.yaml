objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: sequence of integers (e.g., list or NumPy array)
    properties:
      - contains digits 0 and 2
  - name: output_sequence
    type: sequence of integers (e.g., list or NumPy array)
    properties:
      - contains digits 0, 2, and 8
      - same length as input_sequence
  - name: subsequence_of_twos
    type: maximal contiguous block of '2's within the input sequence
    properties:
      - length: N (integer > 0)
actions:
  - name: identify_subsequences
    description: Find the start and end indices of all maximal contiguous subsequences composed entirely of the digit '2' in the input sequence.
  - name: transform_subsequence
    description: For each identified subsequence of '2's with length N, starting at index `start`, modify the corresponding elements in the output sequence from index `start` to `start + floor(N / 2) - 1` to become '8'.
  - name: copy_elements
    description: Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input. Elements that are '0' or are '2's not part of the first floor(N/2) elements of a subsequence remain unchanged from their initial copied value.
relationships:
  - The transformation of an element from '2' to '8' depends on its value ('2') and its position within a contiguous run of '2's.
  - The number of '2's changed to '8's within a subsequence is determined by the integer division (floor) of the subsequence length (N) by 2.
  - '0' elements are never changed.
