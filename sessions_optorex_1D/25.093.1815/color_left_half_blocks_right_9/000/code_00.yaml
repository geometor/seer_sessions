objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains digits 0 and 2
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains digits 0, 2, and 8
      - same length as input_sequence
  - name: subsequence_of_twos
    type: contiguous block of '2's within the input sequence
    properties:
      - length: N (integer > 0)
actions:
  - name: identify_subsequences
    description: Find all maximal contiguous subsequences composed entirely of the digit '2' in the input sequence.
  - name: transform_subsequence
    description: For each identified subsequence of '2's with length N, change the first floor(N / 2) elements from '2' to '8'.
  - name: copy_elements
    description: Elements in the input sequence that are '0' or are '2's not part of the first floor(N/2) elements of a subsequence remain unchanged in the output sequence.
relationships:
  - The transformation of an element depends on its value and its position within a consecutive run of identical elements ('2's).
  - The number of '2's changed to '8's within a subsequence is determined by the integer division of the subsequence length (N) by 2.
