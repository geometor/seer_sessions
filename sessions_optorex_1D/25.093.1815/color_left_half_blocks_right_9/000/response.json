The transformation rule appears to operate locally, focusing on consecutive runs of the digit '2'. The digit '0' seems to remain unchanged in all positions. The digit '2' is sometimes changed to '8', and sometimes remains '2'. The change from '2' to '8' depends on the position of the '2' within a contiguous block of '2's. Specifically, for any consecutive sequence of '2's of length N, the first `floor(N / 2)` elements are transformed into '8's, while the subsequent elements in that sequence remain '2's.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
