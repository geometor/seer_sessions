**Perception:**

The task involves transforming a sequence of single-digit integers (specifically 0s and 2s) into another sequence of the same length, containing 0s, 2s, and 8s. The transformation rule appears to operate locally, focusing on consecutive runs of the digit '2'. The digit '0' seems to remain unchanged in all positions. The digit '2' is sometimes changed to '8', and sometimes remains '2'. The change from '2' to '8' depends on the position of the '2' within a contiguous block of '2's. Specifically, for any consecutive sequence of '2's of length N, the first `floor(N / 2)` elements are transformed into '8's, while the subsequent elements in that sequence remain '2's.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains digits 0 and 2
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers
    properties:
      - contains digits 0, 2, and 8
      - same length as input_sequence
  - name: subsequence_of_twos
    type: contiguous block of '2's within the input sequence
    properties:
      - length: N (integer > 0)
actions:
  - name: identify_subsequences
    description: Find all maximal contiguous subsequences composed entirely of the digit '2' in the input sequence.
  - name: transform_subsequence
    description: For each identified subsequence of '2's with length N, change the first floor(N / 2) elements from '2' to '8'.
  - name: copy_elements
    description: Elements in the input sequence that are '0' or are '2's not part of the first floor(N/2) elements of a subsequence remain unchanged in the output sequence.
relationships:
  - The transformation of an element depends on its value and its position within a consecutive run of identical elements ('2's).
  - The number of '2's changed to '8's within a subsequence is determined by the integer division of the subsequence length (N) by 2.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence with the same length as the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence, identifying the start and end indices of all maximal contiguous subsequences consisting solely of the digit '2'. Keep track of the indices that belong to these subsequences.
3.  For each identified subsequence of '2's starting at index `start`, ending at index `end`, and having length `N = end - start + 1`:
    a.  Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_to_change = N // 2` (integer division).
    b.  For the first `num_to_change` elements within this subsequence (from index `start` to `start + num_to_change - 1`), set the corresponding elements in the output sequence to '8'.
    c.  For the remaining elements within this subsequence (from index `start + num_to_change` to `end`), set the corresponding elements in the output sequence to '2'.
4.  Iterate through the input sequence again. For any element at an index `i` that was *not* part of any identified subsequence of '2's (meaning the input element must be '0'), copy the input element to the corresponding position `i` in the output sequence.
5.  Return the completed output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The analysis indicates that the initial perception of the transformation rule was correct. The rule involves identifying contiguous blocks of the digit '2' and replacing the first half (rounded down) of the '2's in each block with '8's, leaving the remaining '2's and all '0's unchanged. The failure reported in the previous execution results, where the output was identical to the input, contradicts this confirmed rule and the logic implemented in the provided Python code. This suggests an implementation bug, an environment issue, or a problem with how the code was tested, rather than a flaw in the understanding of the task's requirements. The strategy is to re-affirm the logic, document it clearly, and provide this refined understanding to the coder phase, highlighting the discrepancy with the previous test results.

**Facts:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers (or 1D numpy array)
    properties:
      - contains digits 0 and 2
      - has a specific length
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers (or 1D numpy array)
    properties:
      - contains digits 0, 2, and 8
      - has the same length as input_sequence
  - name: subsequence_of_twos
    type: maximal contiguous block of '2's within the input sequence
    properties:
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer
      - length: N (integer > 0)
actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    description: Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial state of the output sequence.
  - name: find_subsequences
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to identify the start and end indices of all maximal contiguous subsequences composed entirely of the digit '2'.
  - name: transform_subsequences
    description: For each identified subsequence of '2's with length N starting at index `start`:
      - Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_to_change = N // 2` (integer division).
      - Modify the corresponding elements in the *output sequence* from index `start` up to (but not including) `start + num_to_change`, setting their value to '8'.
  - name: preserve_elements
    description: Elements in the input sequence that are '0', and '2's that are not part of the first `N // 2` elements of a subsequence, retain their original values in the output sequence (achieved by initializing output as a copy and only modifying the specific '2's).
relationships:
  - The transformation is local to contiguous blocks of '2's.
  - The number of '2's changed to '8's in a block depends only on the length (N) of that block (specifically, `floor(N/2)`).
  - The position of a '0' in the input directly corresponds to the position of a '0' in the output.
  - The position of an unchanged '2' in the output corresponds either to a '2' in the input that was not part of the first `floor(N/2)` elements of its block, or a '2' in a block of length 1 (where N=1, floor(N/2)=0).
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence; this will become the output sequence.
2.  Initialize an index variable `i` to 0.
3.  While `i` is less than the length of the sequence:
    a.  Check the value at index `i` in the *input* sequence.
    b.  If the value is '2':
        i.  Record `i` as the `start_index` of a potential subsequence of '2's.
        ii. Find the `end_index` of the maximal contiguous subsequence of '2's starting at `start_index` by checking subsequent elements in the *input* sequence.
        iii. Calculate the length of this subsequence: `N = end_index - start_index + 1`.
        iv. Calculate the number of elements to change to '8': `num_to_change = N // 2` (integer division).
        v.  Iterate from `k = start_index` up to `start_index + num_to_change - 1`. For each `k`, set the element at index `k` in the *output* sequence to '8'.
        vi. Update the main index `i` to be `end_index + 1` to continue searching after this subsequence.
    c.  If the value at index `i` in the input sequence is '0':
        i.  Leave the corresponding element in the output sequence unchanged (it was already copied).
        ii. Increment the main index `i` by 1.
4.  Return the modified output sequence.
