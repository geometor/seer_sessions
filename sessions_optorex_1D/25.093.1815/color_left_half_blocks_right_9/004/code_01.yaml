objects:
  - name: input_sequence
    type: list of integers (or 1D numpy array)
    properties:
      - contains digits 0 and 2
      - has a specific length
  - name: output_sequence
    type: list of integers (or 1D numpy array)
    properties:
      - contains digits 0, 2, and 8
      - has the same length as input_sequence
  - name: subsequence_of_twos
    type: maximal contiguous block of '2's within the input sequence
    properties:
      - start_index: integer
      - end_index: integer
      - length: N (integer > 0)
actions:
  - name: initialize_output
    description: Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence to serve as the initial state of the output sequence.
  - name: find_subsequences
    description: Iterate through the input sequence to identify the start and end indices of all maximal contiguous subsequences composed entirely of the digit '2'.
  - name: transform_subsequences
    description: For each identified subsequence of '2's with length N starting at index `start`:
      - Calculate the number of elements to change: `num_to_change = N // 2` (integer division).
      - Modify the corresponding elements in the *output sequence* from index `start` up to (but not including) `start + num_to_change`, setting their value to '8'.
  - name: preserve_elements
    description: Elements in the input sequence that are '0', and '2's that are not part of the first `N // 2` elements of a subsequence, retain their original values in the output sequence (achieved by initializing output as a copy and only modifying the specific '2's).
relationships:
  - The transformation is local to contiguous blocks of '2's.
  - The number of '2's changed to '8's in a block depends only on the length (N) of that block (specifically, `floor(N/2)`).
  - The position of a '0' in the input directly corresponds to the position of a '0' in the output.
  - The position of an unchanged '2' in the output corresponds either to a '2' in the input that was not part of the first `floor(N/2)` elements of its block, or a '2' in a block of length 1 (where N=1, floor(N/2)=0).
