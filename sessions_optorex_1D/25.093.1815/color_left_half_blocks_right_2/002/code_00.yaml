Task: Sequence Element Transformation Based on Contiguous Blocks

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2]
  Format: Space-separated string representation in examples, typically processed as a list/array of integers.

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2, 8]
  Constraint: Same length as the input sequence.

Objects:
  - Name: Sequence Element
    Properties:
      - Value: (0, 2, 8)
      - Index: Position within the sequence (0-based).
  - Name: Block_of_Twos
    Definition: A maximal contiguous subsequence containing only the value '2'.
    Properties:
      - Start_Index: Index of the first '2' in the block.
      - End_Index: Index of the last '2' in the block.
      - Length: Number of elements in the block (End_Index - Start_Index + 1).
    Identification: A block starts at index 0 if Sequence[0] == 2, or at index `i` if Sequence[i] == 2 and Sequence[i-1] == 0. It ends at index `j` if Sequence[j] == 2 and either j is the last index or Sequence[j+1] == 0.

Relationships:
  - Name: Contiguity
    Applies To: Sequence Elements
    Definition: Elements are adjacent in the sequence index. Defines Block_of_Twos.
  - Name: Transformation Trigger
    Applies To: Block_of_Twos
    Definition: The properties (specifically Length) of a Block_of_Twos determine how its constituent elements are transformed.

Action:
  - Name: Modify Element Value
    Actor: Transformation Rule
    Object: Sequence Element with Value=2
    Condition: The element is the first or second element of a Block_of_Twos.
    Result: Element Value changes from 2 to 8.
    Rule Specification:
      1. Identify all distinct Block_of_Twos in the input sequence.
      2. For each Block_of_Twos:
         - Let `S` be the Start_Index and `L` be the Length.
         - If `L >= 4`:
           - Change the element at index `S` from 2 to 8.
           - Change the element at index `S + 1` from 2 to 8.
         - Else (`L < 4`, i.e., L is 1, 2, or 3):
           - Change the element at index `S` from 2 to 8.

Default Behavior:
  - Sequence Elements with Value=0 remain unchanged.
  - Sequence Elements with Value=2 that are *not* the first or second (in the case of L>=4) element of a Block_of_Twos remain unchanged.
