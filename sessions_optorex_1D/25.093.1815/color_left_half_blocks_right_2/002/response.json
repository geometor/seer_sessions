            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: modifying the beginning of contiguous blocks of `2`s based on the block's length. The transformation rule (change the first `2` to `8` if block length < 4, change the first two `2`s to `8`s if block length >= 4) holds true for all provided training examples.\n\nThe execution error (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") reported for the previous code seems unrelated to the core logic itself but likely stems from the execution environment or the way input data was passed (e.g., as NumPy arrays instead of standard Python lists, or improper parsing of the input strings). The provided Python code uses standard list indexing and comparisons which should work correctly if given a list of integers.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Re-affirm the transformation logic by analyzing metrics from all examples.\n2.  Refine the documentation (YAML facts) and the natural language program based on this comprehensive understanding.\n3.  Assume the execution error was an environment issue and that the previously derived logic is correct and only needs clear articulation. The next step (coder phase) will involve implementing this logic robustly.\n\n**Metrics Gathering:**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of each example, focusing on the blocks of '2's.\n"
