"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 2s according to the following rules:
1. Identify contiguous blocks of the number '2'.
2. For each block of '2's:
   a. Calculate its length (L).
   b. If L is 4 or greater, change the first two '2's of the block to '8's.
   c. If L is less than 4 (1, 2, or 3), change only the first '2' of the block to an '8'.
3. All '0's and any '2's not modified by the above rules remain unchanged.
The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
