"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 2s according to the following rules:
1. Identify contiguous blocks of the number '2'. A block starts at index 0 if the first element is 2, or at index i if element i is 2 and element i-1 is 0.
2. For each identified block of '2's:
   a. Calculate its length (L).
   b. If L is 4 or greater, change the first two '2's of the block (at the block's start index and the next index) to '8's in the output sequence.
   c. If L is less than 4 (1, 2, or 3), change only the first '2' of the block (at the block's start index) to an '8' in the output sequence.
3. All '0's and any '2's not modified by the above rules remain unchanged.
The output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.
