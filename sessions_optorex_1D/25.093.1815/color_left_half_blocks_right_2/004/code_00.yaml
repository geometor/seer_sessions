Task: Sequence Transformation (Integer Sequence)

Input:
  Type: Sequence (potentially provided as space-separated string or NumPy array)
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2]
  Processing: Input is parsed/converted into a standard Python list of integers for internal processing.

Output:
  Type: Sequence (Python list of integers)
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2, 8]
  Constraint: Same length as input sequence.

Objects:
  - Name: Number
    Properties:
      - Value: (0, 2, 8)
      - Position: Index in the sequence (list index).
  - Name: Block_of_Twos
    Definition: A contiguous subsequence within the list consisting solely of the integer '2'.
    Properties:
      - Start_Index: List index of the first '2' in the block.
      - End_Index: List index of the last '2' in the block.
      - Length: Number of elements in the block (End_Index - Start_Index + 1).

Relationships:
  - Name: Contiguity
    Applies To: Numbers in the sequence (list).
    Definition: Numbers are at adjacent indices in the list. Used to define Blocks_of_Twos.
  - Name: Bounded By
    Applies To: Blocks_of_Twos
    Definition: A block starts at index 0 or when preceded by a '0'. It ends at the last index or when followed by a '0'.

Action:
  - Name: Transform_Block_Start
    Actor: Rule Engine
    Object: Number (Value=2) at the start of a Block_of_Twos.
    Condition: Based on the Length property of the Block_of_Twos it belongs to.
    Rule:
      1. Iterate through the processed list representation of the input sequence.
      2. Identify the Start_Index and End_Index for each Block_of_Twos.
      3. Calculate Block_of_Twos.Length.
      4. If Block_of_Twos.Length >= 4:
         - Change the Number at Start_Index from 2 to 8.
         - Change the Number at Start_Index + 1 from 2 to 8.
      5. Else (Block_of_Twos.Length is 1, 2, or 3):
         - Change the Number at Start_Index from 2 to 8.

Default Behavior:
  - Numbers with Value=0 remain unchanged.
  - Numbers with Value=2 that are not modified by the Transform_Block_Start action remain unchanged.
  - The output is returned as a Python list.
