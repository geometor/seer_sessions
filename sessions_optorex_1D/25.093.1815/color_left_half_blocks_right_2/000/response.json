The `0`s remain unchanged.\n3.  **Context Dependency:** The decision to change a `2` to an `8` is not based solely on the value `2` itself but depends on its context within the sequence, specifically its position within contiguous blocks of `2`s.\n4.  **Block Identification:** The transformation logic involves identifying contiguous subsequences (blocks) composed entirely of `2`s. These blocks are implicitly bounded by `0`s or the start/end of the sequence.\n5.  **Block Length Rule:** The number of `2`s changed to `8`s at the beginning of each block depends on the length of that block:\n    *   If a block of `2`s has a length of 4 or more, the first two `2`s become `8`s.\n    *   If a block of `2`s has a length of 1, 2, or 3, only the first `2` becomes an `8`.\n6.  **Conservation:** Elements that are not `2`s (i.e., `0`s) and the `2`s within blocks that are not designated for change remain unaltered in the output sequence.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
