**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a sequence of single-digit integers (specifically 0s and 2s) as input and produces another sequence of single-digit integers (0s, 2s, and 8s) of the same length as output.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change observed is the transformation of some `2`s into `8`s. The `0`s remain unchanged.
3.  **Context Dependency:** The decision to change a `2` to an `8` is not based solely on the value `2` itself but depends on its context within the sequence, specifically its position within contiguous blocks of `2`s.
4.  **Block Identification:** The transformation logic involves identifying contiguous subsequences (blocks) composed entirely of `2`s. These blocks are implicitly bounded by `0`s or the start/end of the sequence.
5.  **Block Length Rule:** The number of `2`s changed to `8`s at the beginning of each block depends on the length of that block:
    *   If a block of `2`s has a length of 4 or more, the first two `2`s become `8`s.
    *   If a block of `2`s has a length of 1, 2, or 3, only the first `2` becomes an `8`.
6.  **Conservation:** Elements that are not `2`s (i.e., `0`s) and the `2`s within blocks that are not designated for change remain unaltered in the output sequence.

Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2]

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2, 8]
  Constraint: Same length as input sequence.

Objects:
  - Name: Number
    Properties:
      - Value: (0, 2, 8)
      - Position: Index in the sequence
  - Name: Block
    Definition: A contiguous subsequence of identical numbers (specifically '2' in this task).
    Properties:
      - Start_Index: Position of the first element of the block.
      - End_Index: Position of the last element of the block.
      - Length: Number of elements in the block.
      - Value: The number constituting the block (always '2').

Relationships:
  - Name: Contiguity
    Applies To: Numbers in a sequence.
    Definition: Numbers are adjacent in the sequence. Used to define Blocks.
  - Name: Bounded By
    Applies To: Blocks
    Definition: A block is bounded by numbers different from its constituent value (i.e., '0') or by the sequence boundaries (start/end).

Action:
  - Name: Transform
    Actor: Rule Engine
    Object: Number (Value=2)
    Condition: Based on position within a Block and Block Length.
    Result: Number Value changes from 2 to 8.
    Rule:
      1. Identify all Blocks of value '2'.
      2. For each Block:
         - Get Block Length (L).
         - If L >= 4:
           - Change Number at Block.Start_Index from 2 to 8.
           - Change Number at Block.Start_Index + 1 from 2 to 8.
         - Else (L < 4):
           - Change Number at Block.Start_Index from 2 to 8.

Default Behavior:
  - Numbers with Value=0 remain unchanged.
  - Numbers with Value=2 not meeting the Transform conditions remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence, identical in structure to the input sequence initially.
2.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to identify the start and end indices of all contiguous blocks of the number `2`. A block starts when a `2` is encountered after a `0` or at the beginning of the sequence, and ends when a `0` is encountered or at the end of the sequence.
3.  For each identified block of `2`s:
    a.  Calculate the length (`L`) of the block.
    b.  Determine the starting index (`S`) of the block in the input sequence.
    c.  If `L` is 4 or greater:
        i.  Modify the element at index `S` in the output sequence to `8`.
        ii. Modify the element at index `S + 1` in the output sequence to `8`.
    d.  If `L` is less than 4 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3):
        i.  Modify the element at index `S` in the output sequence to `8`.
4.  All elements in the output sequence that were not explicitly modified in step 3 retain their original values from the input sequence.
5.  Return the completed output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The provided code failed execution on all examples due to a `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function, designed to work with Python lists or tuples of integers, was actually passed NumPy arrays by the testing environment. Standard Python comparison operators (`==`, `!=`) on NumPy arrays perform element-wise comparisons, resulting in a boolean array, which cannot be directly evaluated as a single `True` or `False` in an `if` statement's condition.

The underlying transformation logic identified in the previous "dream phase" (identifying blocks of '2's and changing the first one or two elements to '8' based on block length) appears conceptually correct based on the input/output pairs, but the implementation failed due to this type mismatch.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle the expected input type. Given the error, the most robust approach is to convert the input (whether it's a NumPy array, list, or tuple) into a standard Python list at the beginning of the function. This ensures the subsequent logic operates consistently on list elements.
2.  **Logic Verification:** Re-verify the block identification and modification logic against all training examples, ensuring it correctly handles edge cases (blocks at the start/end of the sequence, sequences with no '2's, sequences entirely of '2's).
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the Natural Language Program to accurately reflect the input processing step and the confirmed transformation rules.

**Gather Metrics:**

Due to the execution error, no outputs were generated for comparison. Therefore, metrics like the number of correct/incorrect transformations per example cannot be calculated at this stage. The immediate goal is to fix the type-handling issue to enable execution and subsequent evaluation.

```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Accept the input sequence. If the input is not a standard Python list (e.g., it's a string or NumPy array), parse or convert it into a Python list of integers. Create a mutable copy of this list to serve as the initial output sequence.
2.  Initialize an index variable `i` to 0.
3.  Iterate through the output sequence using the index `i` from the start (`0`) up to, but not including, the length of the sequence (`n`):
    a.  Check the element at the current index `i`.
    b.  If the element is `0`, increment `i` by 1 and continue to the next iteration.
    c.  If the element is `2`, check if it marks the beginning of a new block of `2`s. This is true if `i` is 0, or if the element at index `i-1` is `0`.
        i.  **If it is the start of a block:**
            1.  Record the starting index (`start_index = i`).
            2.  Find the end index (`end_index`) of this contiguous block of `2`s by scanning forward from `start_index`. The block ends just before the next `0` or at the end of the sequence.
            3.  Calculate the length of the block (`block_length = end_index - start_index + 1`).
            4.  Apply the transformation rule based on `block_length`:
                *   If `block_length` is 4 or greater, change the elements in the output sequence at `start_index` and `start_index + 1` to `8`.
                *   If `block_length` is 1, 2, or 3, change only the element in the output sequence at `start_index` to `8`.
            5.  Set the main loop index `i` to `end_index + 1` to advance past the block just processed.
        ii. **If it is a `2` but *not* the start of a block** (meaning the previous element was also `2`), simply increment `i` by 1. (This element was already considered as part of a block processed when its starting element was encountered).
4.  After the loop finishes, return the modified output sequence (as a Python list).
