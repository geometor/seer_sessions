```python
"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 2s according to the following rules:
1. Convert the input sequence (which might be a NumPy array or other iterable) into a standard Python list.
2. Identify contiguous blocks of the number '2' within this list. A block starts at index 0 if the first element is 2, or at index i > 0 if element i is 2 and element i-1 is 0.
3. For each identified block of '2's:
   a. Calculate its length (L).
   b. If L is 4 or greater, change the first two '2's of the block (at the block's start index and the next index) to '8's in the list.
   c. If L is less than 4 (1, 2, or 3), change only the first '2' of the block (at the block's start index) to an '8' in the list.
4. All '0's and any '2's not modified by the above rules remain unchanged.
5. Return the modified list.
