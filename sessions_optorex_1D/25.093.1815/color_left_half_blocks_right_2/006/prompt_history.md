**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output:** The task takes a sequence of single-digit integers (specifically 0s and 2s) as input and produces another sequence of single-digit integers (0s, 2s, and 8s) of the same length as output.
2.  **Core Transformation:** The fundamental change observed is the transformation of some `2`s into `8`s. The `0`s remain unchanged.
3.  **Context Dependency:** The decision to change a `2` to an `8` is not based solely on the value `2` itself but depends on its context within the sequence, specifically its position within contiguous blocks of `2`s.
4.  **Block Identification:** The transformation logic involves identifying contiguous subsequences (blocks) composed entirely of `2`s. These blocks are implicitly bounded by `0`s or the start/end of the sequence.
5.  **Block Length Rule:** The number of `2`s changed to `8`s at the beginning of each block depends on the length of that block:
    *   If a block of `2`s has a length of 4 or more, the first two `2`s become `8`s.
    *   If a block of `2`s has a length of 1, 2, or 3, only the first `2` becomes an `8`.
6.  **Conservation:** Elements that are not `2`s (i.e., `0`s) and the `2`s within blocks that are not designated for change remain unaltered in the output sequence.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2]

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2, 8]
  Constraint: Same length as input sequence.

Objects:
  - Name: Number
    Properties:
      - Value: (0, 2, 8)
      - Position: Index in the sequence
  - Name: Block
    Definition: A contiguous subsequence of identical numbers (specifically '2' in this task).
    Properties:
      - Start_Index: Position of the first element of the block.
      - End_Index: Position of the last element of the block.
      - Length: Number of elements in the block.
      - Value: The number constituting the block (always '2').

Relationships:
  - Name: Contiguity
    Applies To: Numbers in a sequence.
    Definition: Numbers are adjacent in the sequence. Used to define Blocks.
  - Name: Bounded By
    Applies To: Blocks
    Definition: A block is bounded by numbers different from its constituent value (i.e., '0') or by the sequence boundaries (start/end).

Action:
  - Name: Transform
    Actor: Rule Engine
    Object: Number (Value=2)
    Condition: Based on position within a Block and Block Length.
    Result: Number Value changes from 2 to 8.
    Rule:
      1. Identify all Blocks of value '2'.
      2. For each Block:
         - Get Block Length (L).
         - If L >= 4:
           - Change Number at Block.Start_Index from 2 to 8.
           - Change Number at Block.Start_Index + 1 from 2 to 8.
         - Else (L < 4):
           - Change Number at Block.Start_Index from 2 to 8.

Default Behavior:
  - Numbers with Value=0 remain unchanged.
  - Numbers with Value=2 not meeting the Transform conditions remain unchanged.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an empty output sequence, identical in structure to the input sequence initially.
2.  Scan the input sequence from left to right to identify the start and end indices of all contiguous blocks of the number `2`. A block starts when a `2` is encountered after a `0` or at the beginning of the sequence, and ends when a `0` is encountered or at the end of the sequence.
3.  For each identified block of `2`s:
    a.  Calculate the length (`L`) of the block.
    b.  Determine the starting index (`S`) of the block in the input sequence.
    c.  If `L` is 4 or greater:
        i.  Modify the element at index `S` in the output sequence to `8`.
        ii. Modify the element at index `S + 1` in the output sequence to `8`.
    d.  If `L` is less than 4 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3):
        i.  Modify the element at index `S` in the output sequence to `8`.
4.  All elements in the output sequence that were not explicitly modified in step 3 retain their original values from the input sequence.
5.  Return the completed output sequence.
