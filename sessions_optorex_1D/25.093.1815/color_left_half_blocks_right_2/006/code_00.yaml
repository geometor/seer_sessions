Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence (potentially NumPy array)
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2]

Output:
  Type: Sequence (required as NumPy array for testing compatibility)
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2, 8]
  Constraint: Same length as input sequence.

Objects:
  - Name: Number
    Properties:
      - Value: (0, 2, 8)
      - Position: Index in the sequence
  - Name: Block
    Definition: A contiguous subsequence composed entirely of the number '2'.
    Properties:
      - Start_Index: Position of the first element of the block.
      - End_Index: Position of the last element of the block.
      - Length: Number of elements in the block (End_Index - Start_Index + 1).
      - Value: The number constituting the block (always '2').

Relationships:
  - Name: Contiguity
    Applies To: Numbers in a sequence.
    Definition: Numbers are adjacent in the sequence. Used to define Blocks.
  - Name: Bounded By
    Applies To: Blocks
    Definition: A block of '2's starts either at index 0 or after a '0'. It ends either at the last index of the sequence or before a '0'.

Action:
  - Name: Transform Number
    Actor: Rule Engine
    Object: Number (Value=2) within the sequence.
    Condition: The number is the first or second element of an identified Block of '2's, depending on the Block's Length.
    Result: Number Value changes from 2 to 8.
    Rule:
      1. Iterate through the sequence to identify the start of each Block of '2's.
      2. For each identified Block:
         - Determine its Start_Index and End_Index.
         - Calculate Block Length (L = End_Index - Start_Index + 1).
         - If L >= 4:
           - Change the Number at Start_Index from 2 to 8.
           - Change the Number at Start_Index + 1 from 2 to 8.
         - Else (L is 1, 2, or 3):
           - Change the Number at Start_Index from 2 to 8.
      3. Skip processing elements within a block once its start has been handled.

Default Behavior:
  - Numbers with Value=0 remain unchanged.
  - Numbers with Value=2 that are not the first or second (in case L>=4) element of a block remain unchanged.

Return Type Constraint:
  - The final transformed sequence must be returned as a NumPy array.
