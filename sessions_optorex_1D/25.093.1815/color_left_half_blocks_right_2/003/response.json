A block starts at index 0 if the first element is 2, or at index i if element i is 2 and element i-1 is 0.\n2. For each identified block of '2's:\n   a. Calculate its length (L).\n   b. If L is 4 or greater, change the first two '2's of the block (at the block's start index and the next index) to '8's in the output sequence.\n   c. If L is less than 4 (1, 2, or 3), change only the first '2' of the block (at the block's start index) to an '8' in the output sequence.\n3. All '0's and any '2's not modified by the above rules remain unchanged.\nThe output sequence has the same length as the input sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport math # Although not strictly needed for this logic, it's a common import.\n# No other specific imports required for this task.\n\ndef find_block_end(sequence, start_index):\n    \"\"\" Finds the end index of a contiguous block of '2's. \"\"\"\n    n = len(sequence)\n    end_index = start_index\n    # Scan forward to find the last '2' in the block\n    while end_index + 1 < n and sequence[end_index + 1] == 2:\n        end_index += 1\n    return end_index\n\ndef transform(input_sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input sequence.\n\n    Args:\n        input_sequence: A list of integers (0s and 2s).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of integers representing the transformed sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize output_sequence as a mutable copy of the input\n    # Using list() constructor is a common way to create a shallow copy\n    output_sequence = list(input_sequence)\n    n = len(output_sequence)\n    i = 0 # Current index for scanning the sequence\n\n    # Iterate through the sequence to find blocks and apply transformations\n    while i < n:\n        # Check if the current element is '2'\n        if output_sequence[i] == 2:\n            # Check if this '2' marks the beginning of a new block\n            # A block starts at index 0 or if the previous element is 0\n            is_block_start = (i == 0 or output_sequence[i-1] == 0)\n\n            if is_block_start:\n                # Found the start of a block at index 'i'\n                start_index = i\n                \n                # Find the end of the contiguous block of '2's\n                end_index = find_block_end(output_sequence, start_index)\n\n                # Calculate the length of the block\n                block_length = end_index - start_index + 1\n\n                # Apply the transformation rule based on block length\n                if block_length >= 4:\n                    # Change the first two '2's to '8's in the output sequence\n                    output_sequence[start_index] = 8\n                    # The check block_length >= 4 ensures start_index + 1 is valid within the block\n                    output_sequence[start_index + 1] = 8\n                else: # block_length is 1, 2, or 3\n                    # Change only the first '2' to an '8' in the output sequence\n                    output_sequence[start_index] = 8\n\n                # Advance the main loop index 'i' to the position immediately after the processed block\n                # This prevents re-evaluating elements within the same block or starting a new block mid-way\n                i = end_index + 1\n            else:\n                # If it's a '2' but not the start of a block (i.e., previous element was also 2),\n                # just move to the next element.
