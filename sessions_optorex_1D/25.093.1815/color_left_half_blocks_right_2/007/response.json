A block starts at index 0 if the first element is 2, or at index i > 0 if element i is 2 and element i-1 is 0.\n2. For each identified block of '2's:\n   a. Calculate its length (L).\n   b. If L is 4 or greater, change the first two '2's of the block (at the block's start index and the next index) to '8's.\n   c. If L is less than 4 (1, 2, or 3), change only the first '2' of the block (at the block's start index) to an '8'.\n3. All '0's and any '2's not modified by the above rules remain unchanged.\n4.
