```python
import re

"""
Transforms a sequence of 0s and 2s based on the position and grouping of the digit '2'.

Transformation Rules:
1. Any 0 in the input remains 0 in the output.
2. A 2 in the input becomes an 8 if it meets EITHER of the following conditions:
   a. It is the first '2' in a contiguous block of '2's (i.e., it's the first element of the sequence, or it's preceded by a 0).
   b. It is the second '2' in a contiguous block of '2's, AND that block has a total length of 4 or more '2's.
3. Any 2 that does not meet the conditions to become an 8 remains a 2.
