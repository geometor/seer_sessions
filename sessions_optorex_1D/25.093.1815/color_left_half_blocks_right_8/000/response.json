            "text": "Okay, I will analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\n**Perception of Task Elements:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are single-line strings representing sequences of single-digit integers separated by spaces.\n2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the output sequence is identical to the length of the input sequence in all examples.\n3.  **Allowed Values:** The sequences contain only the integers 0, 2, and 8. The input sequences only contain 0 and 2. The output sequences contain 0, 2, and 8.\n4.  **Transformation:** The core transformation appears to involve changing certain instances of the number 2 in the input sequence to 8 in the output sequence. The number 0 seems to remain unchanged in its position.\n5.  **Context Dependency:** The decision to change a 2 to an 8 depends on its position relative to its neighboring elements, specifically whether it initiates a block of 2s and the length/configuration of that block.\n\n**Analysis of Transformation Rule:**\n\nBy comparing the input and output pairs, a pattern emerges for when a '2' is transformed into an '8':\n\n*   A '0' in the input always maps to a '0' in the output.\n*   A '2' in the input maps to an '8' if:\n    *   It is the very first element of the sequence (`index == 0`).\n    *   OR the element immediately preceding it is a '0' (`input[index-1] == 0`).\n    *   OR it is the second element in a contiguous block of '2's (`input[index-1] == 2` and (`index == 1` or `input[index-2] == 0`)) AND it is immediately followed by another '2' (`input[index+1] == 2`).\n*   All other '2's in the input map to a '2' in the output.\n\nThis logic consistently explains the transformations in all provided training examples. For instance, in `2 2 2 2 -> 8 8 2 2`:\n*   The first '2' becomes '8' (start of sequence).\n*   The second '2' becomes '8' (it's the second in the block, and it's followed by another '2').\n*   The third '2' remains '2' (it's neither the first nor the second-followed-by-a-two).\n*   The fourth '2' remains '2'.\n\nIn `0 2 2 2 0 -> 0 8 2 2 0`:\n*   The first '2' becomes '8' (preceded by '0').\n*   The second '2' remains '2' (it's the second in the block, but not followed by another '2').\n*   The third '2' remains '2'.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
