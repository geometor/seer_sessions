Task: Sequence Transformation

Input:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2]
  Properties:
    - Order: Preserved
    - Length: Variable

Output:
  Type: Sequence
  Elements:
    Type: Integer
    Values: [0, 2, 8]
  Properties:
    - Order: Corresponds to input order
    - Length: Same as input length

Transformation_Rules:
  - Action: Process elements sequentially
  - Condition: Element value is 0
    - Result: Output element is 0
  - Condition: Element value is 2
    - Check 1: Element is at the beginning of the sequence (index 0)
      - Result: Output element is 8
    - Check 2: Element is preceded by 0
      - Result: Output element is 8
    - Check 3: Element is preceded by 2 AND (that preceding 2 was the first element OR was preceded by 0) AND the current element is followed by 2
      - Result: Output element is 8
    - Default (if none of the above checks for '2' are true):
      - Result: Output element is 2

Relationships:
  - Positional: index, previous_element, next_element
  - Grouping: contiguous_block_of_2s
