*   **Perception of Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
    *   The digits '0' and '2' appear to have special roles. '0' acts as a filler or space, and '2' appears to be a fixed anchor point.
    *   Each input contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (other than '2'). For example, `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5` in `train_1`, `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4` in `train_2`, `9 9 9 9` in `train_3`.
    *   The transformation involves potentially repositioning this block of non-zero digits relative to the '2'.

    3.  Determine if this block is located to the left or right of the '2'.
    4.  If the block is to the left of '2':
        *   Check if all elements between the end of the block (exclusive) and the index of '2' (exclusive) are '0'.
        *   If yes, and if there is at least one such '0', perform a swap: Move the identified block of digits immediately to the left of '2', and move the sequence of intermediate '0's to the original starting position of the block.
    5.  If the block is to the right of '2':
        *   Check if all elements between the index of '2' (exclusive) and the start of the block (exclusive) are '0'.
        *   If yes, and if there is at least one such '0', perform a swap: Move the identified block of digits immediately to the right of '2', and move the sequence of intermediate '0's to the position immediately following the block's original end position.
    6.  If no intermediate '0's exist between the block and '2' (i.e., they are adjacent or separated only by other non-zero numbers not part of the block), make no changes to the sequence.
    7.  Return the potentially modified sequence.

## Example 1:
Error: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue causing errors across all examples is an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str`) and parse it into a list of integers using `input_str.split()`. However, the testing environment provided the input directly as a list of integers (specifically, a NumPy array, which behaves like a list in this context but lacks the `.split()` method). The underlying logic for identifying the '2', the non-zero block, the intermediate zeros, and performing the swap appears sound based on a manual re-evaluation of the examples. The strategy is to modify the function signature and remove the string parsing step, accepting the input directly as a list of integers.

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**
    A manual analysis confirms the initial logic holds for all provided training examples when the input is treated as a sequence of integers:
    *   `train_1`: Input `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[5]*8` at indices 0-7. '2' at index 8. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.
    *   `train_2`: Input `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]`. Block `[4]*9` at indices 2-10. '2' at index 11. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.
    *   `train_3`: Input `[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[9]*4` at indices 0-3. '2' at index 6. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0]` at indices 4-5. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Correct.
    *   `train_4`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. Block `[6]*4` at indices 3-6. '2' at index 11. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0, 0, 0]` at indices 7-10. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2]`. Correct.
    *   `train_5`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6]*5` at indices 3-7. '2' at index 8. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.
    *   `train_6`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. Block `[5]*4` at indices 8-11. '2' at index 3. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0, 0, 0]` at indices 4-7. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Correct.
    *   `train_7`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]`. Block `[4]*3` at indices 7-9. '2' at index 10. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.
    No code execution is needed as the error was purely type-based, and the logic can be verified manually against the examples.

    1.  Accept the input as a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the single occurrence of the digit '2' and its index within the sequence.
    3.  Identify the contiguous block of identical digits that are not '0' and not '2'. Record its starting index, ending index, and the digit value.
    4.  Determine if this block is located to the left or right of the '2'.
    5.  If the block is to the left of '2':
        *   Examine the subsequence between the end of the block (exclusive) and the index of '2' (exclusive).
        *   If this subsequence is non-empty and contains only '0's, perform a swap: Create a new sequence where the elements before the block's start remain, followed by the intermediate sequence of '0's, followed by the block, followed by '2' and the rest of the original sequence.
    6.  If the block is to the right of '2':
        *   Examine the subsequence between the index of '2' (exclusive) and the start of the block (exclusive).
        *   If this subsequence is non-empty and contains only '0's, perform a swap: Create a new sequence where the elements up to and including '2' remain, followed by the block, followed by the intermediate sequence of '0's, followed by the rest of the original sequence from after the block's end.
    7.  If no intermediate subsequence of only '0's exists between the block and '2' (i.e., they are adjacent, separated by other non-zero digits, or the subsequence is empty), make no changes to the original sequence.
    8.  Return the resulting sequence.
