*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue causing errors across all examples is an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str`) and parse it into a list of integers using `input_str.split()`. However, the testing environment provided the input directly as a list of integers (specifically, a NumPy array, which behaves like a list in this context but lacks the `.split()` method). The underlying logic for identifying the '2', the non-zero block, the intermediate zeros, and performing the swap appears sound based on a manual re-evaluation of the examples. The strategy is to modify the function signature and remove the string parsing step, accepting the input directly as a list of integers.

*   **Metrics and Analysis:**
    A manual analysis confirms the initial logic holds for all provided training examples when the input is treated as a sequence of integers:
    *   `train_1`: Input `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[5]*8` at indices 0-7. '2' at index 8. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.
    *   `train_2`: Input `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]`. Block `[4]*9` at indices 2-10. '2' at index 11. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.
    *   `train_3`: Input `[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[9]*4` at indices 0-3. '2' at index 6. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0]` at indices 4-5. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Correct.
    *   `train_4`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. Block `[6]*4` at indices 3-6. '2' at index 11. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0, 0, 0]` at indices 7-10. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2]`. Correct.
    *   `train_5`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6]*5` at indices 3-7. '2' at index 8. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.
    *   `train_6`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. Block `[5]*4` at indices 8-11. '2' at index 3. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0, 0, 0]` at indices 4-7. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Correct.
    *   `train_7`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]`. Block `[4]*3` at indices 7-9. '2' at index 10. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.
    No code execution is needed as the error was purely type-based, and the logic can be verified manually against the examples.

    relationships:
      - type: spatial
        between: [digit_block, digit_two]
        description: The block can be to the left or right of the '2'.
      - type: separation
        between: [digit_block, digit_two]
        medium: digit_zero
        description: A sequence composed solely of zeros may exist between the block and the '2'.
    action:
      - type: conditional_swap
        condition: A non-empty sequence consisting only of digit_zero exists between the digit_block and digit_two.
        elements_involved: [digit_block, sequence of digit_zero between block and two]
        effect: The digit_block and the intermediate sequence of zeros swap positions, resulting in the digit_block becoming adjacent to the digit_two.
        directionality: The block moves towards the '2', occupying the space previously held by the zeros, and the zeros move to occupy the space previously held by the block.
    invariants:
      - If no swap occurs, the sequence remains unchanged.
      - The position of '2' relative to digits *not* involved in the block or the intermediate zeros remains the same even if a swap happens.
      - The order and values of digits within the `digit_block` remain unchanged.
      - The total count of each digit in the sequence remains the same after transformation.
      - The length of the sequence remains 12.

*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Accept the input as a sequence (list or array) of 12 integers.
    2.  Identify the single occurrence of the digit '2' and its index within the sequence.
    3.  Identify the contiguous block of identical digits that are not '0' and not '2'. Record its starting index, ending index, and the digit value.
    4.  Determine if this block is located to the left or right of the '2'.
    5.  If the block is to the left of '2':
        *   Examine the subsequence between the end of the block (exclusive) and the index of '2' (exclusive).
        *   If this subsequence is non-empty and contains only '0's, perform a swap: Create a new sequence where the elements before the block's start remain, followed by the intermediate sequence of '0's, followed by the block, followed by '2' and the rest of the original sequence.
    6.  If the block is to the right of '2':
        *   Examine the subsequence between the index of '2' (exclusive) and the start of the block (exclusive).
        *   If this subsequence is non-empty and contains only '0's, perform a swap: Create a new sequence where the elements up to and including '2' remain, followed by the block, followed by the intermediate sequence of '0's, followed by the rest of the original sequence from after the block's end.
    7.  If no intermediate subsequence of only '0's exists between the block and '2' (i.e., they are adjacent, separated by other non-zero digits, or the subsequence is empty), make no changes to the original sequence.
    8.  Return the resulting sequence.
