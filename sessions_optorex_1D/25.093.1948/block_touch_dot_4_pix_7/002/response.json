The `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str`) and parse it into a list of integers using `input_str.split()`. However, the testing environment provided the input directly as a list of integers (specifically, a NumPy array, which behaves like a list in this context but lacks the `.split()` method). The underlying logic for identifying the '2', the non-zero block, the intermediate zeros, and performing the swap appears sound based on a manual re-evaluation of the examples. The strategy is to modify the function signature and remove the string parsing step, accepting the input directly as a list of integers.\n\n*   **Metrics and Analysis:**\n    A manual analysis confirms the initial logic holds for all provided training examples when the input is treated as a sequence of integers:\n    *   `train_1`: Input `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[5]*8` at indices 0-7. '2' at index 8. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.\n    *   `train_2`: Input `[0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2]`. Block `[4]*9` at indices 2-10. '2' at index 11. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.\n    *   `train_3`: Input `[9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[9]*4` at indices 0-3. '2' at index 6. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0]` at indices 4-5. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Correct.\n    *   `train_4`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. Block `[6]*4` at indices 3-6. '2' at index 11. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0, 0, 0]` at indices 7-10. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2]`. Correct.\n    *   `train_5`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0]`. Block `[6]*5` at indices 3-7. '2' at index 8. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.\n    *   `train_6`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5]`. Block `[5]*4` at indices 8-11. '2' at index 3. Intermediate zeros `[0, 0, 0, 0]` at indices 4-7. Swap occurs. Output `[0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. Correct.\n    *   `train_7`: Input `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 2, 0]`. Block `[4]*3` at indices 7-9. '2' at index 10. No intermediate zeros. Output matches input. Correct.\n    No code execution is needed as the error was purely type-based, and the logic can be verified manually against the examples.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
