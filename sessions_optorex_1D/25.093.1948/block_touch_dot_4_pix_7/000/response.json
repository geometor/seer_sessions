'0' acts as a filler or space, and '2' appears to be a fixed anchor point.\n    *   Each input contains a single contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (other than '2'). For example, `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5` in `train_1`, `4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4` in `train_2`, `9 9 9 9` in `train_3`.\n    *   The transformation involves potentially repositioning this block of non-zero digits relative to the '2'.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "
