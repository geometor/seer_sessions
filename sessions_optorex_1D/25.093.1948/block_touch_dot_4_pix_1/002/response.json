            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe primary issue identified from the execution results is a fundamental type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed expecting a space-separated string (`input_str`) as input, which it would then parse into a list of integers using `input_str.split()`. However, the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array, which does not have a `.split()` method, causing the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` for every example.\n\nThe core transformation logic (finding the anchor->zeros->block pattern, calculating the shift, and rearranging the sequence) was never actually tested due to this initial error.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to accept a list of integers directly (or a NumPy array and convert it internally). Remove the `parse_input` function as it's no longer needed if the input is already in the correct format. Adjust the `format_output` function to ensure it still correctly converts the final list back to the required string format.\n2.  **Verify Logic:** Since the analysis of the examples suggests the originally proposed logic (find first anchor->zeros->block, shift block left by `min(zero_count, block_length)`, move overwritten zeros to the end) is likely correct, the main task after fixing the input type is to ensure the implementation accurately reflects this logic. The previous code seems to implement this correctly, so primarily, the input handling needs fixing.\n\n## Metrics\n\nSince the code failed during input parsing, no execution metrics related to the transformation logic itself could be gathered. However, analyzing the input/output pairs confirms the pattern:\n\n| Example | Input                               | Output                              | Anchor | Zeros Start/Count | Block Start/Length/Value | Shift Amount | Change |\n| :------ | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----- | :---------------- | :------------------------- | :----------- | :----- |\n| train_1 | `0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0`           | `0 0 2 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=2) | 3 / 4             | 7 / 4 / 4                | 4            | Yes    |\n| train_2 | `2 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0`           | `2 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=0) | 1 / 4             | 5 / 6 / 7                | 4            | Yes    |\n| train_3 | `0 2 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0`           | `0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=1) | 2 / 2             | 4 / 6 / 3                | 2            | Yes    |\n| train_4 | `0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3`           | `0 2 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=1) | 2 / 6             | 8 / 4 / 3                | 4            | Yes    |\n| train_5 | `2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`           | `2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`           | 2 (i=0) | N/A               | N/A                      | 0            | No     |\n| train_6 | `9 9 9 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 0 0`           | `9 9 9 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=6) | 7 / 5             | N/A                      | 0            | No     |\n| train_7 | `0 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0`           | `0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=1) | 2 / 1             | 3 / 7 / 1                | 1            | Yes    |\n\nThe analysis confirms the hypothesis: find the first non-zero digit (`Anchor`) followed by one or more zeros (`Zeros`), followed by a block of identical non-zero digits (`Block`). The `Shift Amount` is `min(Zeros Count, Block Length)`. The block moves left by `Shift Amount`, replacing that many zeros immediately preceding it. These replaced zeros are moved to the end of the sequence. If the pattern isn't found or `Shift Amount` is 0, the sequence is unchanged.\n\n## Facts\n\n"

Initialize variables to track the found pattern: `found_pattern = False`, `anchor_index = -1`, `zero_start = -1`, `zero_count = 0`, `block_start = -1`, `block_length = 0`, `block_value = -1`.\n3.  Iterate through the list with index `i` from 0 up to `len(list) - 2` (at least 3 elements needed for anchor, zero, block start).\n4.  **Find Anchor:** If the current element `list[i]` is non-zero and `found_pattern` is `False`:\n    *   Check if the next element `list[i+1]` is zero.\n    *   **Find Zeros:** If `list[i+1]` is zero, start searching for the end of the zero sequence. Let `j = i + 1`. While `j < len(list)` and `list[j]` is zero, increment `j`. Calculate `current_zero_count = j - (i + 1)`.\n    *   If `current_zero_count > 0`:\n        *   **Find Block:** Check if `j < len(list)` (we haven't run off the end) and `list[j]` is non-zero.\n        *   If a non-zero element `list[j]` is found, this is the potential start of the block.

Break the outer loop (since we only care about the first pattern).\n5.  **Check if Transformation Needed:** After iterating, if `found_pattern` is `False`, return the original list formatted as a space-separated string.\n6.  **Calculate Shift:** Calculate `shift_amount = min(zero_count, block_length)`.\n7.  **Apply Transformation:** If `shift_amount > 0`:\n    *   Create the `new_list`.\n    *   Append elements from the original list from index 0 up to (but not including) the start of the zeros that will be removed (`block_start - shift_amount`).\n    *   Append `block_length` copies of `block_value` to `new_list`.\n    *   Append elements from the original list starting from the element *after* the original block (`block_start + block_length`) to the end.\n    *   Append `shift_amount` zeros to the end of `new_list`.\n    *   Return the `new_list` formatted as a space-separated string.\n8.  **No Shift Case:** If `shift_amount` is 0, return the original list formatted as a space-separated string."
