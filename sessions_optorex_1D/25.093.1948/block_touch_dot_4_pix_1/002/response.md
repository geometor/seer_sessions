## General Assessment

The primary issue identified from the execution results is a fundamental type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed expecting a space-separated string (`input_str`) as input, which it would then parse into a list of integers using `input_str.split()`. However, the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array, which does not have a `.split()` method, causing the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` for every example.

The core transformation logic (finding the anchor->zeros->block pattern, calculating the shift, and rearranging the sequence) was never actually tested due to this initial error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to accept a list of integers directly (or a NumPy array and convert it internally). Remove the `parse_input` function as it's no longer needed if the input is already in the correct format. Adjust the `format_output` function to ensure it still correctly converts the final list back to the required string format.
2.  **Verify Logic:** Since the analysis of the examples suggests the originally proposed logic (find first anchor->zeros->block, shift block left by `min(zero_count, block_length)`, move overwritten zeros to the end) is likely correct, the main task after fixing the input type is to ensure the implementation accurately reflects this logic. The previous code seems to implement this correctly, so primarily, the input handling needs fixing.

## Metrics

Since the code failed during input parsing, no execution metrics related to the transformation logic itself could be gathered. However, analyzing the input/output pairs confirms the pattern:

| Example | Input                               | Output                              | Anchor | Zeros Start/Count | Block Start/Length/Value | Shift Amount | Change |
| :------ | :---------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----- | :---------------- | :------------------------- | :----------- | :----- |
| train_1 | `0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0`           | `0 0 2 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=2) | 3 / 4             | 7 / 4 / 4                | 4            | Yes    |
| train_2 | `2 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0`           | `2 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=0) | 1 / 4             | 5 / 6 / 7                | 4            | Yes    |
| train_3 | `0 2 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0`           | `0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=1) | 2 / 2             | 4 / 6 / 3                | 2            | Yes    |
| train_4 | `0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3`           | `0 2 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=1) | 2 / 6             | 8 / 4 / 3                | 4            | Yes    |
| train_5 | `2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`           | `2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`           | 2 (i=0) | N/A               | N/A                      | 0            | No     |
| train_6 | `9 9 9 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 0 0`           | `9 9 9 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=6) | 7 / 5             | N/A                      | 0            | No     |
| train_7 | `0 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0`           | `0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0`           | 2 (i=1) | 2 / 1             | 3 / 7 / 1                | 1            | Yes    |

The analysis confirms the hypothesis: find the first non-zero digit (`Anchor`) followed by one or more zeros (`Zeros`), followed by a block of identical non-zero digits (`Block`). The `Shift Amount` is `min(Zeros Count, Block Length)`. The block moves left by `Shift Amount`, replacing that many zeros immediately preceding it. These replaced zeros are moved to the end of the sequence. If the pattern isn't found or `Shift Amount` is 0, the sequence is unchanged.

Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Type: List of Integers
      Properties:
        - Length: 12

  - Digit:
      Properties:
        - Value (0-9)

        - ZeroDigit (Value is 0)
        - NonZeroDigit (Value is 1-9)
  - PatternInstance:
      Represents: The specific structure targeted by the transformation.
      Components:
        - AnchorDigit: The first NonZeroDigit found when scanning left-to-right that is immediately followed by one or more ZeroDigits.
        - PrecedingZeros: A contiguous sub-sequence of one or more ZeroDigits immediately following the AnchorDigit.
        - MovingBlock: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroDigits immediately following the PrecedingZeros.
      Properties:
        - AnchorIndex: Position of the AnchorDigit.
        - ZeroStartIndex: Position of the first PrecedingZero.
        - ZeroCount: Number of digits in PrecedingZeros.
        - BlockStartIndex: Position of the first digit in MovingBlock.
        - BlockLength: Number of digits in MovingBlock.
        - BlockValue: The repeated digit value in MovingBlock.
        - IsFound: Boolean indicating if a valid PatternInstance exists in the Sequence.

Relationships:
  - A PatternInstance is searched for within the Sequence, starting from the left.
  - Only the *first* valid PatternInstance found triggers the action.
  - An AnchorDigit *immediately precedes* the PrecedingZeros.
  - PrecedingZeros *immediately precede* the MovingBlock.

Action:
  - Identify: Scan the Sequence left-to-right to find the first PatternInstance.
  - Check Existence: If no PatternInstance is found, the Sequence remains unchanged.
  - Calculate Shift: If a PatternInstance is found, calculate `shift_amount = min(ZeroCount, BlockLength)`.
  - Conditional Execution:
      - If `shift_amount` is 0, the Sequence remains unchanged.
      - If `shift_amount` > 0:
          1. Define segments of the original Sequence:
             - `prefix`: Elements before the zeros that will be removed (indices `0` to `BlockStartIndex - shift_amount - 1`).
             - `block`: The MovingBlock elements (repeated `BlockValue`, `BlockLength` times).
             - `suffix`: Elements after the original MovingBlock (indices `BlockStartIndex + BlockLength` to end).
             - `moved_zeros`: Zeros to append (repeated `0`, `shift_amount` times).
          2. Construct the new Sequence by concatenating: `prefix + block + suffix + moved_zeros`.
  - Format Output: Convert the final Sequence (either original or transformed) into a space-separated string.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a list of 12 integers (handle potential NumPy array input by converting it to a list if necessary).
2.  Initialize variables to track the found pattern: `found_pattern = False`, `anchor_index = -1`, `zero_start = -1`, `zero_count = 0`, `block_start = -1`, `block_length = 0`, `block_value = -1`.
3.  Iterate through the list with index `i` from 0 up to `len(list) - 2` (at least 3 elements needed for anchor, zero, block start).
4.  **Find Anchor:** If the current element `list[i]` is non-zero and `found_pattern` is `False`:
    *   Check if the next element `list[i+1]` is zero.
    *   **Find Zeros:** If `list[i+1]` is zero, start searching for the end of the zero sequence. Let `j = i + 1`. While `j < len(list)` and `list[j]` is zero, increment `j`. Calculate `current_zero_count = j - (i + 1)`.
    *   If `current_zero_count > 0`:
        *   **Find Block:** Check if `j < len(list)` (we haven't run off the end) and `list[j]` is non-zero.
        *   If a non-zero element `list[j]` is found, this is the potential start of the block. Let `current_block_start = j`, `current_block_value = list[j]`. Let `k = j + 1`. While `k < len(list)` and `list[k] == current_block_value`, increment `k`. Calculate `current_block_length = k - current_block_start`.
        *   If `current_block_length > 0`, a valid pattern is found. Set `found_pattern = True`, store `anchor_index = i`, `zero_start = i + 1`, `zero_count = current_zero_count`, `block_start = current_block_start`, `block_length = current_block_length`, `block_value = current_block_value`. Break the outer loop (since we only care about the first pattern).
5.  **Check if Transformation Needed:** After iterating, if `found_pattern` is `False`, return the original list formatted as a space-separated string.
6.  **Calculate Shift:** Calculate `shift_amount = min(zero_count, block_length)`.
7.  **Apply Transformation:** If `shift_amount > 0`:
    *   Create the `new_list`.
    *   Append elements from the original list from index 0 up to (but not including) the start of the zeros that will be removed (`block_start - shift_amount`).
    *   Append `block_length` copies of `block_value` to `new_list`.
    *   Append elements from the original list starting from the element *after* the original block (`block_start + block_length`) to the end.
    *   Append `shift_amount` zeros to the end of `new_list`.
    *   Return the `new_list` formatted as a space-separated string.
8.  **No Shift Case:** If `shift_amount` is 0, return the original list formatted as a space-separated string.
