Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Elements:** The sequences consist of zeros and non-zero digits. A significant feature appears to be contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action involves relocating a specific block of identical non-zero digits. This block seems to "slide" leftwards, moving over some or all of the zeros that immediately precede it. The zeros that are "overwritten" by the sliding block are then moved to the end of the sequence.
4.  **Trigger Condition:** This transformation seems contingent on finding a non-zero digit, followed by one or more zeros, followed by a block of identical non-zero digits. If this pattern doesn't exist, or if there are no zeros between the initial non-zero digit and the block, the sequence remains unchanged.
5.  **Shift Amount:** The distance the block shifts left seems limited by either the number of preceding zeros or the length of the block itself, whichever is smaller.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Properties:
        - A list of 12 single-digit integers.
        - Contains Digits.
  - Digit:
      Properties:
        - Value (0-9).
        - Position (index in the sequence).
      Types:
        - ZeroDigit (Value is 0).
        - NonZeroDigit (Value is 1-9).
  - Block:
      Properties:
        - A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroDigits.
        - StartPosition (index of the first digit).
        - EndPosition (index of the last digit).
        - Length (number of digits in the block).
        - DigitValue (the repeated non-zero digit).
  - AnchorDigit:
      Properties:
        - The first NonZeroDigit encountered before a potential Block, when scanning left-to-right.
        - Must be followed by at least one ZeroDigit before the Block starts.
  - PrecedingZeros:
      Properties:
        - A contiguous sub-sequence of ZeroDigits.
        - Located between an AnchorDigit and a Block.
        - Count (number of zeros).

Relationships:
  - An AnchorDigit *precedes* PrecedingZeros.
  - PrecedingZeros *precede* a Block.
  - The transformation *acts upon* the first occurrence of the AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> Block pattern.

Action:
  - Identify: Find the first AnchorDigit, the subsequent PrecedingZeros, and the immediately following Block.
  - Calculate Shift: Determine the number of positions to shift (`shift_count`) as the minimum of the PrecedingZeros count and the Block length.
  - Conditional Execution: If `shift_count` is greater than 0:
      - Remove: Delete the `shift_count` ZeroDigits immediately before the Block.
      - Relocate: Move the entire Block `shift_count` positions to the left.
      - Append: Add `shift_count` ZeroDigits to the very end of the Sequence.
  - No Action: If no AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> Block pattern is found, or if `shift_count` is 0, the Sequence remains unchanged.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Iterate through the list to find the first instance of the following pattern:
    *   A non-zero digit (the "anchor").
    *   Followed immediately by one or more zeros (the "preceding zeros").
    *   Followed immediately by a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the "moving block").
3.  If this pattern is not found, return the original list.
4.  If the pattern is found:
    *   Record the index of the anchor digit.
    *   Count the number of preceding zeros (`zero_count`).
    *   Record the starting index of the moving block.
    *   Determine the length of the moving block (`block_length`).
    *   Record the value of the digit in the moving block.
5.  Calculate the number of positions to shift the block left (`shift_amount`) as the minimum of `zero_count` and `block_length`.
6.  If `shift_amount` is 0, return the original list.
7.  If `shift_amount` > 0:
    *   Create a new list.
    *   Copy elements from the original list up to (but not including) the first preceding zero that will be removed.
    *   Append the digits of the moving block to the new list.
    *   Append any remaining digits from the original list that were *after* the moving block.
    *   Append `shift_amount` zeros to the end of the new list.
8.  Return the modified list.
9.  Format the final list back into a space-separated string for the output.

Transformation Rule:

The transformation operates on a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
It searches for the first occurrence of a specific pattern: a non-zero digit (anchor), 
followed immediately by one or more zeros, followed immediately by a contiguous block 
of identical non-zero digits (moving block).

If this pattern is found, the moving block shifts leftwards, overwriting some of the 
preceding zeros. The number of positions shifted (`shift_amount`) is the minimum of 
the count of preceding zeros and the length of the moving block. The zeros that were 
overwritten by the shift are moved to the end of the sequence.

If the pattern is not found, or if the calculated `shift_amount` is zero (meaning 
there are no zeros between the anchor and the block, or the block has length zero, 
which shouldn't happen with non-zero blocks), the sequence remains unchanged.

"""
Transformation Rule:

The transformation operates on a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 single-digit integers.
It searches for the first occurrence from the left of a specific pattern: 
1. A non-zero digit (the "anchor").
2. Immediately followed by one or more zero digits (the "preceding zeros").
3. Immediately followed by a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the "moving block").

If this pattern is found:
- Calculate the shift amount: `shift_amount = min(count of preceding zeros, length of moving block)`.
- If `shift_amount` is greater than 0:
    - Reconstruct the sequence:
        - Take the elements *before* the `shift_amount` zeros that immediately precede the block.
        - Append the *entire* moving block.
        - Append the elements that originally came *after* the moving block.
        - Append `shift_amount` zeros to the very end.
- If `shift_amount` is 0, the sequence remains unchanged.

If the pattern (anchor -> zeros -> block) is not found anywhere in the sequence, 
the sequence remains unchanged.

The final output should be a space-separated string of the digits in the potentially 
modified sequence.

## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided error logs indicate that the `transform` function, specifically the `parse_input_string` helper, was expecting a space-separated string of digits (e.g., `"0 0 2 0..."`) but received a string representation of a list (e.g., `"[0, 0, 2, 0,...]"`). This caused the `int()` conversion within `split()` to fail.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function to accept list or NumPy array inputs directly, as this seems to be the format used by the testing environment. Remove or adjust the faulty string parsing logic for this specific input type. Assume the core input will be sequence-like.
2.  **Verify Core Logic:** Re-run the examples with the corrected input handling to test the actual transformation logic (finding the anchor-zeros-block pattern and performing the shift).
3.  **Gather Metrics:** Use code execution to systematically analyze each example with the corrected code, recording details about the pattern found (if any), the calculated shift, and whether the output matches the expected result.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program based on the verified logic and corrected understanding of input/output formats.

## Metrics Gathering

Let's execute the corrected logic on the examples to gather metrics.

## Revised Analysis

The code execution confirms that the initial `ValueError` was due to incorrect input parsing. The test harness provides the input as lists (or potentially NumPy arrays), not space-separated strings or string representations of lists like `"[0, 0, ...]"`, except for the single provided test case (`test_1`). The corrected `transform` function handles list/array input correctly, and the added parsing for the `"[...]" `string format worked for `test_1`.

The core transformation logic (find anchor -> zeros -> block, calculate shift = min(zeros, block_length), rebuild list) appears correct and successfully produced the expected output for all training examples.

The analysis of `train_4` was slightly off in the initial dreamer phase description; the shift is indeed `min(zero_count=6, block_length=4) = 4`, which the code correctly calculates and applies.

The prediction for `test_1` ([0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0]) is `0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 2 0 0`.
*   The pattern search starts. It skips the initial zeros.
*   It finds the block of 5s starting at index 2. This block is followed by zeros (indices 8, 9), not an anchor.
*   It continues scanning past the 5s block.
*   Anchor: `5` at index 7.
*   Preceding Zeros: `0, 0` at indices 8, 9 (count = 2).
*   Moving Block: `2` at index 10 (length = 1, value = 2).
*   Shift = `min(zero_count=2, block_length=1) = 1`.
*   Rebuild:
    *   Take elements before the removed zero: `grid[0 : (block_start=10) - (shift=1)]` -> `grid[0:9]` -> `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]`
    *   Append moving block: `[2]`
    *   Append elements after moving block: `grid[(block_start=10 + block_length=1) : n=12]` -> `grid[11:12]` -> `[0]`
    *   Append shifted zeros: `[0]` * shift -> `[0]`
    *   Result: `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0] + [2] + [0] + [0]` = `[0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0]`
    *   Formatted: `"0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 2 0 0"`

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Type: List or NumPy array of integers.
      Properties:
        - Contains Digits.
        - Fixed length (observed as 12 in examples).
  - Digit:
      Properties:
        - Value (0-9).
        - Position (index in the sequence).
      Types:
        - ZeroDigit (Value is 0).
        - NonZeroDigit (Value is 1-9).
  - Pattern:
      Type: A specific consecutive arrangement of digits searched for from left-to-right.
      Components:
        - AnchorDigit: The first NonZeroDigit in the pattern.
        - PrecedingZeros: A sequence of one or more ZeroDigits immediately following the AnchorDigit.
        - MovingBlock: A contiguous sequence of identical NonZeroDigits immediately following the PrecedingZeros.
      Properties:
        - AnchorIndex: Index of the AnchorDigit.
        - ZeroCount: Number of digits in PrecedingZeros.
        - BlockStartIndex: Index of the first digit in the MovingBlock.
        - BlockLength: Number of digits in the MovingBlock.
        - BlockValue: The repeated digit value in the MovingBlock.

Relationships:
  - The transformation targets the *first* occurrence of the Pattern found in the Sequence.
  - AnchorDigit *precedes* PrecedingZeros.
  - PrecedingZeros *precede* MovingBlock.

Action:
  - FindPattern: Scan the Sequence left-to-right to locate the first occurrence of the Pattern.
  - CalculateShift: If a Pattern is found, determine `shift_amount = min(ZeroCount, BlockLength)`.
  - ConditionalTransform:
      - If no Pattern is found OR `shift_amount` is 0:
          - Return the original Sequence unchanged.
      - If a Pattern is found AND `shift_amount` > 0:
          - Construct a new Sequence by:
              1. Taking elements from the original Sequence *before* the `shift_amount` zeros that immediately precede the MovingBlock (i.e., up to index `BlockStartIndex - shift_amount`).
              2. Appending the *entire* MovingBlock.
              3. Appending elements from the original Sequence that came *after* the MovingBlock (i.e., from index `BlockStartIndex + BlockLength` onwards).
              4. Appending `shift_amount` ZeroDigits to the end.
          - Return the new Sequence.
  - FormatOutput: Convert the final Sequence (list of integers) into a space-separated string.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence (assumed to be a list or NumPy array of 12 integers). Ensure it's represented as a standard Python list.
2.  Scan the list from left to right (index `i` from 0) to find the first occurrence of the following three-part pattern consecutively:
    *   An "anchor" digit: a non-zero digit (`grid[i] != 0`).
    *   "Preceding zeros": one or more zero digits immediately following the anchor (`grid[i+1] == 0`, `grid[i+2] == 0`, ...). Let the count be `zero_count`.
    *   A "moving block": a contiguous sequence of identical non-zero digits immediately following the preceding zeros. Let the length be `block_length` and the digit value be `block_value`. Record the starting index of this block (`block_start`).
3.  If this complete pattern (anchor -> one-or-more-zeros -> block) is not found anywhere in the list, return the original list, formatted as a space-separated string.
4.  If the pattern is found:
    *   Calculate the amount to shift: `shift_amount = min(zero_count, block_length)`.
    *   If `shift_amount` is 0 (this happens only if `zero_count` or `block_length` is zero, which shouldn't occur with the pattern definition requiring non-zero block and >0 zeros), return the original list formatted as a space-separated string.
    *   If `shift_amount` > 0:
        *   Create a new, empty list called `result`.
        *   Append the elements from the original list from the beginning up to (but not including) the `shift_amount` zeros that are about to be overwritten. The index of the first overwritten zero is `block_start - shift_amount`. So, append `grid[0 : block_start - shift_amount]` to `result`.
        *   Append the *entire* moving block (i.e., `block_length` digits of `block_value`) to `result`.
        *   Append the elements from the original list that came *after* the moving block. The index of the first element after the block is `block_start + block_length`. So, append `grid[block_start + block_length : ]` to `result`.
        *   Append `shift_amount` zeros to the end of `result`.
        *   Return the `result` list, formatted as a space-separated string.
