A non-zero digit (the \"anchor\").\n2. Immediately followed by one or more zero digits (the \"preceding zeros\").\n3. Immediately followed by a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the \"moving block\").\n\nIf this pattern is found:\n- Calculate the shift amount: `shift_amount = min(count of preceding zeros, length of moving block)`.\n- If `shift_amount` is greater than 0:\n    - Reconstruct the sequence:\n        - Take the elements *before* the `shift_amount` zeros that immediately precede the block.\n        - Append the *entire* moving block.\n        - Append the elements that originally came *after* the moving block.\n        - Append `shift_amount` zeros to the very end.\n- If `shift_amount` is 0, the sequence remains unchanged.\n\nIf the pattern (anchor -> zeros -> block) is not found anywhere in the sequence, \nthe sequence remains unchanged.\n\nThe final output should be a space-separated string of the digits in the potentially \nmodified sequence.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef find_first_pattern(grid: list[int]):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the details of the first occurrence of the anchor -> zeros -> block pattern.\n\n    Args:\n        grid: The input list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary containing pattern details:\n        {'anchor_index', 'zero_start', 'zero_count', \n         'block_start', 'block_length', 'block_value'} \n        if a valid pattern is found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(grid)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        # 1.
