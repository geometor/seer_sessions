The number of positions shifted (`shift_amount`) is the minimum of \nthe count of preceding zeros and the length of the moving block. The zeros that were \noverwritten by the shift are moved to the end of the sequence.\n\nIf the pattern is not found, or if the calculated `shift_amount` is zero (meaning \nthere are no zeros between the anchor and the block, or the block has length zero, \nwhich shouldn't happen with non-zero blocks), the sequence remains unchanged.\n\"\"\"\n\ndef parse_input(input_str: str) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"Converts the space-separated string input into a list of integers.\"\"\"\n    return [int(digit) for digit in input_str.split()]\n\ndef format_output(grid: list[int]) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Converts the list of integers back into a space-separated string.\"\"\"\n    return \" \".join(map(str, grid))\n\ndef find_pattern(grid: list[int]):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first occurrence of the anchor -> zeros -> block pattern.\n\n    Returns:\n        A dictionary containing pattern details \n        {'anchor_index', 'zero_count', 'block_start', 'block_length', 'block_value'} \n        if found, otherwise None.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(grid)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        # 1.
