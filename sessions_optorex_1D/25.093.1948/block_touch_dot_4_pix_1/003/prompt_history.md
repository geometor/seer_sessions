Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Elements:** The sequences consist of zeros and non-zero digits. A significant feature appears to be contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action involves relocating a specific block of identical non-zero digits. This block seems to "slide" leftwards, moving over some or all of the zeros that immediately precede it. The zeros that are "overwritten" by the sliding block are then moved to the end of the sequence.
4.  **Trigger Condition:** This transformation seems contingent on finding a non-zero digit, followed by one or more zeros, followed by a block of identical non-zero digits. If this pattern doesn't exist, or if there are no zeros between the initial non-zero digit and the block, the sequence remains unchanged.
5.  **Shift Amount:** The distance the block shifts left seems limited by either the number of preceding zeros or the length of the block itself, whichever is smaller.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Properties:
        - A list of 12 single-digit integers.
        - Contains Digits.
  - Digit:
      Properties:
        - Value (0-9).
        - Position (index in the sequence).
      Types:
        - ZeroDigit (Value is 0).
        - NonZeroDigit (Value is 1-9).
  - Block:
      Properties:
        - A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroDigits.
        - StartPosition (index of the first digit).
        - EndPosition (index of the last digit).
        - Length (number of digits in the block).
        - DigitValue (the repeated non-zero digit).
  - AnchorDigit:
      Properties:
        - The first NonZeroDigit encountered before a potential Block, when scanning left-to-right.
        - Must be followed by at least one ZeroDigit before the Block starts.
  - PrecedingZeros:
      Properties:
        - A contiguous sub-sequence of ZeroDigits.
        - Located between an AnchorDigit and a Block.
        - Count (number of zeros).

Relationships:
  - An AnchorDigit *precedes* PrecedingZeros.
  - PrecedingZeros *precede* a Block.
  - The transformation *acts upon* the first occurrence of the AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> Block pattern.

Action:
  - Identify: Find the first AnchorDigit, the subsequent PrecedingZeros, and the immediately following Block.
  - Calculate Shift: Determine the number of positions to shift (`shift_count`) as the minimum of the PrecedingZeros count and the Block length.
  - Conditional Execution: If `shift_count` is greater than 0:
      - Remove: Delete the `shift_count` ZeroDigits immediately before the Block.
      - Relocate: Move the entire Block `shift_count` positions to the left.
      - Append: Add `shift_count` ZeroDigits to the very end of the Sequence.
  - No Action: If no AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> Block pattern is found, or if `shift_count` is 0, the Sequence remains unchanged.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Iterate through the list to find the first instance of the following pattern:
    *   A non-zero digit (the "anchor").
    *   Followed immediately by one or more zeros (the "preceding zeros").
    *   Followed immediately by a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the "moving block").
3.  If this pattern is not found, return the original list.
4.  If the pattern is found:
    *   Record the index of the anchor digit.
    *   Count the number of preceding zeros (`zero_count`).
    *   Record the starting index of the moving block.
    *   Determine the length of the moving block (`block_length`).
    *   Record the value of the digit in the moving block.
5.  Calculate the number of positions to shift the block left (`shift_amount`) as the minimum of `zero_count` and `block_length`.
6.  If `shift_amount` is 0, return the original list.
7.  If `shift_amount` > 0:
    *   Create a new list.
    *   Copy elements from the original list up to (but not including) the first preceding zero that will be removed.
    *   Append the digits of the moving block to the new list.
    *   Append any remaining digits from the original list that were *after* the moving block.
    *   Append `shift_amount` zeros to the end of the new list.
8.  Return the modified list.
9.  Format the final list back into a space-separated string for the output.

## General Assessment

The primary issue identified from the execution results is a fundamental type mismatch. The `transform` function was designed expecting a space-separated string (`input_str`) as input, which it would then parse into a list of integers using `input_str.split()`. However, the testing environment provided the input as a NumPy array, which does not have a `.split()` method, causing the `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'` for every example.

The core transformation logic (finding the anchor->zeros->block pattern, calculating the shift, and rearranging the sequence) was never actually tested due to this initial error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the `transform` function signature and internal logic to accept a list of integers directly (or a NumPy array and convert it internally). Remove the `parse_input` function as it's no longer needed if the input is already in the correct format. Adjust the `format_output` function to ensure it still correctly converts the final list back to the required string format.
2.  **Verify Logic:** Since the analysis of the examples suggests the originally proposed logic (find first anchor->zeros->block, shift block left by `min(zero_count, block_length)`, move overwritten zeros to the end) is likely correct, the main task after fixing the input type is to ensure the implementation accurately reflects this logic. The previous code seems to implement this correctly, so primarily, the input handling needs fixing.

## Metrics

Since the code failed during input parsing, no execution metrics related to the transformation logic itself could be gathered. However, analyzing the input/output pairs confirms the pattern:

| Example | Input                               | Output                              | Anchor | Zeros Start/Count | Block Start/Length/Value | Shift Amount | Change |

The analysis confirms the hypothesis: find the first non-zero digit (`Anchor`) followed by one or more zeros (`Zeros`), followed by a block of identical non-zero digits (`Block`). The `Shift Amount` is `min(Zeros Count, Block Length)`. The block moves left by `Shift Amount`, replacing that many zeros immediately preceding it. These replaced zeros are moved to the end of the sequence. If the pattern isn't found or `Shift Amount` is 0, the sequence is unchanged.

        - PrecedingZeros: A contiguous sub-sequence of one or more ZeroDigits immediately following the AnchorDigit.
        - MovingBlock: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroDigits immediately following the PrecedingZeros.
      Properties:
        - AnchorIndex: Position of the AnchorDigit.
        - ZeroStartIndex: Position of the first PrecedingZero.
        - ZeroCount: Number of digits in PrecedingZeros.
        - BlockStartIndex: Position of the first digit in MovingBlock.
        - BlockLength: Number of digits in MovingBlock.
        - BlockValue: The repeated digit value in MovingBlock.
        - IsFound: Boolean indicating if a valid PatternInstance exists in the Sequence.

Relationships:
  - A PatternInstance is searched for within the Sequence, starting from the left.
  - Only the *first* valid PatternInstance found triggers the action.
  - An AnchorDigit *immediately precedes* the PrecedingZeros.
  - PrecedingZeros *immediately precede* the MovingBlock.

Action:
  - Identify: Scan the Sequence left-to-right to find the first PatternInstance.
  - Check Existence: If no PatternInstance is found, the Sequence remains unchanged.
  - Calculate Shift: If a PatternInstance is found, calculate `shift_amount = min(ZeroCount, BlockLength)`.
  - Conditional Execution:
      - If `shift_amount` is 0, the Sequence remains unchanged.
      - If `shift_amount` > 0:
          1. Define segments of the original Sequence:
             - `prefix`: Elements before the zeros that will be removed (indices `0` to `BlockStartIndex - shift_amount - 1`).
             - `block`: The MovingBlock elements (repeated `BlockValue`, `BlockLength` times).
             - `suffix`: Elements after the original MovingBlock (indices `BlockStartIndex + BlockLength` to end).
             - `moved_zeros`: Zeros to append (repeated `0`, `shift_amount` times).
          2. Construct the new Sequence by concatenating: `prefix + block + suffix + moved_zeros`.
  - Format Output: Convert the final Sequence (either original or transformed) into a space-separated string.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input as a list of 12 integers (handle potential NumPy array input by converting it to a list if necessary).
2.  Initialize variables to track the found pattern: `found_pattern = False`, `anchor_index = -1`, `zero_start = -1`, `zero_count = 0`, `block_start = -1`, `block_length = 0`, `block_value = -1`.
3.  Iterate through the list with index `i` from 0 up to `len(list) - 2` (at least 3 elements needed for anchor, zero, block start).
4.  **Find Anchor:** If the current element `list[i]` is non-zero and `found_pattern` is `False`:
    *   Check if the next element `list[i+1]` is zero.
    *   **Find Zeros:** If `list[i+1]` is zero, start searching for the end of the zero sequence. Let `j = i + 1`. While `j < len(list)` and `list[j]` is zero, increment `j`. Calculate `current_zero_count = j - (i + 1)`.
    *   If `current_zero_count > 0`:
        *   **Find Block:** Check if `j < len(list)` (we haven't run off the end) and `list[j]` is non-zero.
        *   If a non-zero element `list[j]` is found, this is the potential start of the block. Let `current_block_start = j`, `current_block_value = list[j]`. Let `k = j + 1`. While `k < len(list)` and `list[k] == current_block_value`, increment `k`. Calculate `current_block_length = k - current_block_start`.
        *   If `current_block_length > 0`, a valid pattern is found. Set `found_pattern = True`, store `anchor_index = i`, `zero_start = i + 1`, `zero_count = current_zero_count`, `block_start = current_block_start`, `block_length = current_block_length`, `block_value = current_block_value`. Break the outer loop (since we only care about the first pattern).
5.  **Check if Transformation Needed:** After iterating, if `found_pattern` is `False`, return the original list formatted as a space-separated string.
6.  **Calculate Shift:** Calculate `shift_amount = min(zero_count, block_length)`.
7.  **Apply Transformation:** If `shift_amount > 0`:
    *   Create the `new_list`.
    *   Append elements from the original list from index 0 up to (but not including) the start of the zeros that will be removed (`block_start - shift_amount`).
    *   Append `block_length` copies of `block_value` to `new_list`.
    *   Append elements from the original list starting from the element *after* the original block (`block_start + block_length`) to the end.
    *   Append `shift_amount` zeros to the end of `new_list`.
    *   Return the `new_list` formatted as a space-separated string.
8.  **No Shift Case:** If `shift_amount` is 0, return the original list formatted as a space-separated string.
