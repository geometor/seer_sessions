            "text": "Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.\n\n## Perception\n\n1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.\n2.  **Key Elements:** The sequences consist of zeros and non-zero digits. A significant feature appears to be contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.\n3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action involves relocating a specific block of identical non-zero digits. This block seems to \"slide\" leftwards, moving over some or all of the zeros that immediately precede it. The zeros that are \"overwritten\" by the sliding block are then moved to the end of the sequence.\n4.  **Trigger Condition:** This transformation seems contingent on finding a non-zero digit, followed by one or more zeros, followed by a block of identical non-zero digits. If this pattern doesn't exist, or if there are no zeros between the initial non-zero digit and the block, the sequence remains unchanged.\n5.  **Shift Amount:** The distance the block shifts left seems limited by either the number of preceding zeros or the length of the block itself, whichever is smaller.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
