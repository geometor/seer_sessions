Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Properties:
        - A list of 12 single-digit integers.
        - Contains Digits.
  - Digit:
      Properties:
        - Value (0-9).
        - Position (index in the sequence).
      Types:
        - ZeroDigit (Value is 0).
        - NonZeroDigit (Value is 1-9).
  - Block:
      Properties:
        - A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroDigits.
        - StartPosition (index of the first digit).
        - EndPosition (index of the last digit).
        - Length (number of digits in the block).
        - DigitValue (the repeated non-zero digit).
  - AnchorDigit:
      Properties:
        - The first NonZeroDigit encountered before a potential Block, when scanning left-to-right.
        - Must be followed by at least one ZeroDigit before the Block starts.
  - PrecedingZeros:
      Properties:
        - A contiguous sub-sequence of ZeroDigits.
        - Located between an AnchorDigit and a Block.
        - Count (number of zeros).

Relationships:
  - An AnchorDigit *precedes* PrecedingZeros.
  - PrecedingZeros *precede* a Block.
  - The transformation *acts upon* the first occurrence of the AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> Block pattern.

Action:
  - Identify: Find the first AnchorDigit, the subsequent PrecedingZeros, and the immediately following Block.
  - Calculate Shift: Determine the number of positions to shift (`shift_count`) as the minimum of the PrecedingZeros count and the Block length.
  - Conditional Execution: If `shift_count` is greater than 0:
      - Remove: Delete the `shift_count` ZeroDigits immediately before the Block.
      - Relocate: Move the entire Block `shift_count` positions to the left.
      - Append: Add `shift_count` ZeroDigits to the very end of the Sequence.
  - No Action: If no AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> Block pattern is found, or if `shift_count` is 0, the Sequence remains unchanged.
