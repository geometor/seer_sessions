Okay, let's break down the transformation logic for this task.

## Perception

1.  **Input/Output Format:** Both input and output are sequences of 12 single-digit integers.
2.  **Key Elements:** The sequences consist of zeros and non-zero digits. A significant feature appears to be contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
3.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action involves relocating a specific block of identical non-zero digits. This block seems to "slide" leftwards, moving over some or all of the zeros that immediately precede it. The zeros that are "overwritten" by the sliding block are then moved to the end of the sequence.
4.  **Trigger Condition:** This transformation seems contingent on finding a non-zero digit, followed by one or more zeros, followed by a block of identical non-zero digits. If this pattern doesn't exist, or if there are no zeros between the initial non-zero digit and the block, the sequence remains unchanged.
5.  **Shift Amount:** The distance the block shifts left seems limited by either the number of preceding zeros or the length of the block itself, whichever is smaller.

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Properties:
        - A list of 12 single-digit integers.
        - Contains Digits.
  - Digit:
      Properties:
        - Value (0-9).
        - Position (index in the sequence).
      Types:
        - ZeroDigit (Value is 0).
        - NonZeroDigit (Value is 1-9).
  - Block:
      Properties:
        - A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroDigits.
        - StartPosition (index of the first digit).
        - EndPosition (index of the last digit).
        - Length (number of digits in the block).
        - DigitValue (the repeated non-zero digit).
  - AnchorDigit:
      Properties:
        - The first NonZeroDigit encountered before a potential Block, when scanning left-to-right.
        - Must be followed by at least one ZeroDigit before the Block starts.
  - PrecedingZeros:
      Properties:
        - A contiguous sub-sequence of ZeroDigits.
        - Located between an AnchorDigit and a Block.
        - Count (number of zeros).

Relationships:
  - An AnchorDigit *precedes* PrecedingZeros.
  - PrecedingZeros *precede* a Block.
  - The transformation *acts upon* the first occurrence of the AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> Block pattern.

Action:
  - Identify: Find the first AnchorDigit, the subsequent PrecedingZeros, and the immediately following Block.
  - Calculate Shift: Determine the number of positions to shift (`shift_count`) as the minimum of the PrecedingZeros count and the Block length.
  - Conditional Execution: If `shift_count` is greater than 0:
      - Remove: Delete the `shift_count` ZeroDigits immediately before the Block.
      - Relocate: Move the entire Block `shift_count` positions to the left.
      - Append: Add `shift_count` ZeroDigits to the very end of the Sequence.
  - No Action: If no AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> Block pattern is found, or if `shift_count` is 0, the Sequence remains unchanged.

```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Parse the input string into a list of integers.
2.  Iterate through the list to find the first instance of the following pattern:
    *   A non-zero digit (the "anchor").
    *   Followed immediately by one or more zeros (the "preceding zeros").
    *   Followed immediately by a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the "moving block").
3.  If this pattern is not found, return the original list.
4.  If the pattern is found:
    *   Record the index of the anchor digit.
    *   Count the number of preceding zeros (`zero_count`).
    *   Record the starting index of the moving block.
    *   Determine the length of the moving block (`block_length`).
    *   Record the value of the digit in the moving block.
5.  Calculate the number of positions to shift the block left (`shift_amount`) as the minimum of `zero_count` and `block_length`.
6.  If `shift_amount` is 0, return the original list.
7.  If `shift_amount` > 0:
    *   Create a new list.
    *   Copy elements from the original list up to (but not including) the first preceding zero that will be removed.
    *   Append the digits of the moving block to the new list.
    *   Append any remaining digits from the original list that were *after* the moving block.
    *   Append `shift_amount` zeros to the end of the new list.
8.  Return the modified list.
9.  Format the final list back into a space-separated string for the output.

Transformation Rule:

The transformation operates on a sequence of 12 single-digit integers.
It searches for the first occurrence of a specific pattern: a non-zero digit (anchor), 
followed immediately by one or more zeros, followed immediately by a contiguous block 
of identical non-zero digits (moving block).

If this pattern is found, the moving block shifts leftwards, overwriting some of the 
preceding zeros. The number of positions shifted (`shift_amount`) is the minimum of 
the count of preceding zeros and the length of the moving block. The zeros that were 
overwritten by the shift are moved to the end of the sequence.

If the pattern is not found, or if the calculated `shift_amount` is zero (meaning 
there are no zeros between the anchor and the block, or the block has length zero, 
which shouldn't happen with non-zero blocks), the sequence remains unchanged.

## General Assessment

The core issue was an input type mismatch. The `transform` function, particularly its `parse_input` helper (in the originally intended design) or the initial type checking (in the provided code), expected a specific format (likely a string of space-separated digits) but received input in a different format (likely a list or the string representation of a list, e.g., `'[0, 0, ...]'`). This caused the `int()` conversion to fail.

The underlying transformation logic, however, as described in the previous natural language program and implemented in the `find_first_pattern` and subsequent steps within the `transform` function, appears to be correct based on a manual walkthrough of the examples.

**Strategy for Resolution:**

1.  **Standardize Input Handling:** Ensure the `transform` function robustly handles the expected input types. The provided Python code already attempts this by checking for `np.ndarray` and assuming list-like otherwise. It should be slightly modified to also explicitly handle the case where the input is a string, parsing it accordingly. This makes the function adaptable to different testing environments or input sources.
2.  **Validate Logic:** Since the core logic seems correct based on simulation, no changes to the pattern finding or sequence reconstruction algorithm are needed at this time. The focus is solely on fixing the input processing bottleneck.

## Metrics

The previous execution failed during input parsing for all examples due to the `ValueError: invalid literal for int()`. Therefore, metrics related to the transformation logic (like pattern found, shift amount) could not be gathered from the failed run.

However, simulating the *intended* logic (as described in the previous NL program and Python code) yields the following:

| Example | Input                                   | Pattern Found? | Anchor Idx | Zero Count | Block Start | Block Len | Block Val | Shift Amount | Predicted Output                        | Matches Expected |

## Facts


```yaml
Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Type: List or Array of Integers
      Properties:
        - Elements: Single-digit integers (0-9).
        - Length: Fixed (appears to be 12 in examples).
        - Ordered.
  - PatternInstance:
      Properties:
        - AnchorDigit: The first NonZeroDigit in the pattern.
          - Index: Position of AnchorDigit.
        - PrecedingZeros: A contiguous sub-sequence of one or more ZeroDigits immediately following the AnchorDigit.
          - StartIndex: Position of the first ZeroDigit.
          - Count: Number of ZeroDigits.
        - MovingBlock: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical NonZeroDigits immediately following the PrecedingZeros.
          - StartIndex: Position of the first digit in the block.
          - Length: Number of digits in the block.
          - Value: The repeated digit value.
  - Digit:
      Types:
        - ZeroDigit (Value is 0).
        - NonZeroDigit (Value is 1-9).

Relationships:
  - A PatternInstance is defined by an AnchorDigit -> PrecedingZeros -> MovingBlock sequence.
  - The transformation *targets* the *first* PatternInstance found when scanning the Sequence from left to right.

Action:
  - Find: Locate the first PatternInstance in the input Sequence.
  - Check: If no PatternInstance is found, the Sequence remains unchanged.
  - Calculate: If a PatternInstance is found, calculate the `shift_amount = min(PrecedingZeros.Count, MovingBlock.Length)`.
  - Conditional Execution:
      - If `shift_amount` is 0, the Sequence remains unchanged.
      - If `shift_amount` > 0:
          - Construct New Sequence:
              1. Copy elements from the original Sequence *before* the `shift_amount` zeros that are immediately preceding the MovingBlock (i.e., up to index `MovingBlock.StartIndex - shift_amount`).
              2. Append the *entire* MovingBlock.
              3. Append elements from the original Sequence that were *after* the MovingBlock (i.e., from index `MovingBlock.StartIndex + MovingBlock.Length` onwards).
              4. Append `shift_amount` ZeroDigits to the end.
          - Replace: The original Sequence is replaced by the New Sequence.

Input Handling:
  - The process accepts input as either:
      - A string of space-separated digits.
      - A list or NumPy array of integers.
  - If input is a string, it's parsed into a list of integers first.

Output Formatting:
  - The final Sequence (modified or original) is formatted as a string of space-separated digits.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  **Input Processing:** Accept the input, which can be either a string of space-separated single digits or a pre-parsed list/array of integers. If it's a string, parse it into a list of integers. Let this list be `grid`.
2.  **Pattern Search:** Scan the `grid` from left to right to find the *first* occurrence of the following pattern:
    *   A non-zero digit (the "anchor").
    *   Immediately followed by one or more zeros (the "preceding zeros").
    *   Immediately followed by a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the "moving block").
3.  **Conditional Transformation:**
    *   **If no such pattern is found:** The `grid` remains unchanged. Proceed to step 5.
    *   **If the pattern is found:**
        *   Identify the count of preceding zeros (`zero_count`) and the length of the moving block (`block_length`).
        *   Calculate the shift distance: `shift_amount = min(zero_count, block_length)`.
        *   **If `shift_amount` is 0:** The `grid` remains unchanged. Proceed to step 5.
        *   **If `shift_amount` > 0:** Reconstruct the `grid` as follows:
            *   Take the slice of the original `grid` from the beginning up to the index where the `shift_amount` zeros (the ones being conceptually overwritten) begin.
            *   Append the *entire* moving block.
            *   Append the slice of the original `grid` containing elements that came *after* the moving block.
            *   Append `shift_amount` zeros to the end of the list. Let this new list be the modified `grid`.
4.  **Output Formatting:** Convert the final `grid` (either original or modified) into a string where each digit is separated by a single space.
5.  **Return:** Return the formatted string.
