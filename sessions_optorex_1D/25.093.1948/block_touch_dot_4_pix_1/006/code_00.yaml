Objects:
  - Sequence:
      Type: List or NumPy array of integers.
      Properties:
        - Contains Digits.
        - Fixed length (observed as 12 in examples).
  - Digit:
      Properties:
        - Value (0-9).
        - Position (index in the sequence).
      Types:
        - ZeroDigit (Value is 0).
        - NonZeroDigit (Value is 1-9).
  - Pattern:
      Type: A specific consecutive arrangement of digits searched for from left-to-right.
      Components:
        - AnchorDigit: The first NonZeroDigit in the pattern.
        - PrecedingZeros: A sequence of one or more ZeroDigits immediately following the AnchorDigit.
        - MovingBlock: A contiguous sequence of identical NonZeroDigits immediately following the PrecedingZeros.
      Properties:
        - AnchorIndex: Index of the AnchorDigit.
        - ZeroCount: Number of digits in PrecedingZeros.
        - BlockStartIndex: Index of the first digit in the MovingBlock.
        - BlockLength: Number of digits in the MovingBlock.
        - BlockValue: The repeated digit value in the MovingBlock.

Relationships:
  - The transformation targets the *first* occurrence of the Pattern found in the Sequence.
  - AnchorDigit *precedes* PrecedingZeros.
  - PrecedingZeros *precede* MovingBlock.

Action:
  - FindPattern: Scan the Sequence left-to-right to locate the first occurrence of the Pattern.
  - CalculateShift: If a Pattern is found, determine `shift_amount = min(ZeroCount, BlockLength)`.
  - ConditionalTransform:
      - If no Pattern is found OR `shift_amount` is 0:
          - Return the original Sequence unchanged.
      - If a Pattern is found AND `shift_amount` > 0:
          - Construct a new Sequence by:
              1. Taking elements from the original Sequence *before* the `shift_amount` zeros that immediately precede the MovingBlock (i.e., up to index `BlockStartIndex - shift_amount`).
              2. Appending the *entire* MovingBlock.
              3. Appending elements from the original Sequence that came *after* the MovingBlock (i.e., from index `BlockStartIndex + BlockLength` onwards).
              4. Appending `shift_amount` ZeroDigits to the end.
          - Return the new Sequence.
  - FormatOutput: Convert the final Sequence (list of integers) into a space-separated string.
