"""
Transformation Rule:

The transformation operates on a sequence (list or NumPy array) of 12 single-digit integers.
It searches for the first occurrence from the left of a specific pattern: 
1. A non-zero digit (the "anchor").
2. Immediately followed by one or more zero digits (the "preceding zeros").
3. Immediately followed by a contiguous block of identical non-zero digits (the "moving block").

If this pattern is found:
- Calculate the shift amount: `shift_amount = min(count of preceding zeros, length of moving block)`.
- If `shift_amount` is greater than 0:
    - Reconstruct the sequence:
        - Take the elements *before* the `shift_amount` zeros that immediately precede the block.
        - Append the *entire* moving block.
        - Append the elements that originally came *after* the moving block.
        - Append `shift_amount` zeros to the very end.
- If `shift_amount` is 0, the sequence remains unchanged.

If the pattern (anchor -> zeros -> block) is not found anywhere in the sequence, 
the sequence remains unchanged.

The final output should be a space-separated string of the digits in the potentially 
modified sequence.
