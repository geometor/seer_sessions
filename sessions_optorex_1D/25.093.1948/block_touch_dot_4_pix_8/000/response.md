Okay, let's break down the transformation.

**Perception of Elements:**

*   **Objects:** The core objects are sequences of digits. Within these sequences, we can identify:
    *   Individual digits.
    *   A special digit `2`, acting as a pivot or anchor.
    *   The digit `0`, acting as a filler or spacer that can be moved.
    *   Contiguous blocks of identical digits other than `0` or `2`. Let's call these "value blocks".
*   **Properties:**
    *   Sequences have a fixed length.
    *   The digit `2` appears exactly once in all examples.
    *   Each example (except train_1) features exactly one "value block". In train_1, the value block (`9`s) is adjacent to the `2`.
    *   Digits `0` can appear multiple times and are located between the value block and the `2`, or elsewhere.
*   **Actions:** The primary action is rearranging the sequence elements. Specifically:
    *   A value block moves towards the `2`.
    *   The `0`s originally separating the value block and the `2` are relocated.
*   **Relationships:** The key relationship is the relative position of the value block with respect to the `2`.
    *   Value block is to the left of `2`.
    *   Value block is to the right of `2`.
    *   Value block is adjacent to `2` (a special case where no `0`s are between them).

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
task_description: Rearrange a sequence of digits based on the relative positions of a 'value block' and the digit '2'.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of digits
      - fixed_length
  - object: digit_2
    properties:
      - role: pivot/anchor
      - count: exactly one per sequence
  - object: digit_0
    properties:
      - role: filler/spacer
      - count: variable
      - behavior: movable
  - object: value_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of identical digits (not 0 or 2)
      - count: at most one per sequence (in examples)
      - behavior: moves towards digit_2
relations:
  - type: spatial
    subject: value_block
    object: digit_2
    states:
      - left_of
      - right_of
      - adjacent_to
actions:
  - name: rearrange
    inputs:
      - sequence
      - position_of_2
      - value_block (if exists)
      - zeros_between_block_and_2 (if any)
    outputs:
      - rearranged_sequence
    logic:
      - If value_block is left_of 2:
          - move value_block to be immediately left_of 2
          - move zeros_between_block_and_2 to the start of the sequence
      - If value_block is right_of 2:
          - move value_block to be immediately right_of 2
          - move zeros_between_block_and_2 to the end of the sequence
      - If no value_block exists or it's adjacent_to 2:
          - sequence remains unchanged
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Parse the input string into a list of digits.
2.  Locate the index of the digit `2`.
3.  Search the list for the first occurrence of a contiguous block of identical digits `B` where the digit is neither `0` nor `2`.
4.  If no such block `B` is found, return the original input sequence unchanged.
5.  Determine if the block `B` is positioned to the left or right of the digit `2`.
6.  Identify the sub-sequence of digits `Z` located strictly between the block `B` and the digit `2`. Note that `Z` will consist only of `0`s based on the examples. If `B` and `2` are adjacent, `Z` is empty.
7.  Construct the output sequence by removing both block `B` and the intermediate sequence `Z` from their original positions.
8.  If the block `B` was originally to the left of `2`:
    a.  Insert the digits from `Z` at the beginning of the sequence.
    b.  Insert the digits from block `B` immediately before the digit `2`.
9.  If the block `B` was originally to the right of `2`:
    a.  Insert the digits from block `B` immediately after the digit `2`.
    b.  Append the digits from `Z` to the end of the sequence.
10. Format the resulting list of digits back into a space-separated string for the output.
