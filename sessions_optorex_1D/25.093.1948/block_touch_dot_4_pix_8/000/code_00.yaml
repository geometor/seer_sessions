task_description: Rearrange a sequence of digits based on the relative positions of a 'value block' and the digit '2'.
elements:
  - object: sequence
    properties:
      - type: list of digits
      - fixed_length
  - object: digit_2
    properties:
      - role: pivot/anchor
      - count: exactly one per sequence
  - object: digit_0
    properties:
      - role: filler/spacer
      - count: variable
      - behavior: movable
  - object: value_block
    properties:
      - type: contiguous sequence of identical digits (not 0 or 2)
      - count: at most one per sequence (in examples)
      - behavior: moves towards digit_2
relations:
  - type: spatial
    subject: value_block
    object: digit_2
    states:
      - left_of
      - right_of
      - adjacent_to
actions:
  - name: rearrange
    inputs:
      - sequence
      - position_of_2
      - value_block (if exists)
      - zeros_between_block_and_2 (if any)
    outputs:
      - rearranged_sequence
    logic:
      - If value_block is left_of 2:
          - move value_block to be immediately left_of 2
          - move zeros_between_block_and_2 to the start of the sequence
      - If value_block is right_of 2:
          - move value_block to be immediately right_of 2
          - move zeros_between_block_and_2 to the end of the sequence
      - If no value_block exists or it's adjacent_to 2:
          - sequence remains unchanged
