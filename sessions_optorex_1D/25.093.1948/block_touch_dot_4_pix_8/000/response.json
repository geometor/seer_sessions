Within these sequences, we can identify:\n    *   Individual digits.\n    *   A special digit `2`, acting as a pivot or anchor.\n    *   The digit `0`, acting as a filler or spacer that can be moved.\n    *   Contiguous blocks of identical digits other than `0` or `2`. Let's call these \"value blocks\".\n*   **Properties:**\n    *   Sequences have a fixed length.\n    *   The digit `2` appears exactly once in all examples.\n    *   Each example (except train_1) features exactly one \"value block\". In train_1, the value block (`9`s) is adjacent to the `2`.\n    *   Digits `0` can appear multiple times and are located between the value block and the `2`, or elsewhere.\n*   **Actions:** The primary action is rearranging the sequence elements. Specifically:\n    *   A value block moves towards the `2`.\n    *   The `0`s originally separating the value block and the `2` are relocated.\n*   **Relationships:** The key relationship is the relative position of the value block with respect to the `2`.\n    *   Value block is to the left of `2`.\n    *   Value block is to the right of `2`.\n    *   Value block is adjacent to `2` (a special case where no `0`s are between them).\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
