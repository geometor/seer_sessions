Usually, there's one such \"main block\" that undergoes movement.\n4.  **Context:** The zeros (`0`) surrounding the main block and the marker `2` are relevant. Specifically, the zeros located *between* the main block and the `2` seem to participate in the transformation.\n5.  **Action:** The core action appears to be a positional swap or shift involving the main block and the intervening zeros relative to the marker `2`. The direction of the shift depends on whether the block is initially to the left or right of `2`.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
