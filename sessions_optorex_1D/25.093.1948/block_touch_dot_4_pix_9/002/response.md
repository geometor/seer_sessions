## General Assessment and Strategy

The primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The previous code assumed the input was a string requiring parsing (`input_str.split()`), while the testing environment provided a data structure (likely a NumPy array or list) which does not have a `.split()` method. This caused the code to fail before the core transformation logic could be executed.

The strategy is to:
1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the approach to directly accept a list or array of integers as input, eliminating the need for string parsing and formatting functions (`parse_input`, `format_output`) within the core `transform` logic.
2.  **Validate Core Logic:** Re-examine the previously defined transformation rules against all provided training examples, assuming the input is correctly handled as a list of integers. The initial walkthrough suggests the two-pattern logic (`X, 0, 2` swap prioritized over `2, 0..., 0, Y` shift) holds for the examples.
3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the correct input object type (list/array of integers) and confirm the details of the transformation rules based on the re-evaluation.

## Metrics and Rule Validation

Based on a manual walkthrough and simulation of the intended logic (ignoring the original parsing error), the two core rules appear to cover the training examples:

1.  **Rule 1 (Swap):** Find the first instance of `X, 0, 2` where `X` is not 0 and not 2. Swap `X` and `0` -> `0, X, 2`. Stop.
2.  **Rule 2 (Shift):** If Rule 1 doesn't apply, find the first instance of `2, 0..., 0, Y` where there's at least one 0, and `Y` is a non-empty contiguous block of digits that are not 0 or 2. Move block `Y` immediately after the `2`, followed by the original intervening zeros. Stop.
3.  **Default:** If neither rule applies, return the input unchanged.

The simulation confirms that the core transformation logic, when applied directly to list inputs, correctly reproduces the output for all training examples. The previous errors were solely due to the incorrect input handling assumption.

## Facts (YAML)


```yaml
Task: Conditionally rearrange elements in a sequence based on local patterns involving the numbers 0 and 2.

Input_Type: List of 12 integers.
Output_Type: List of 12 integers.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The input list of 12 integers.
  - Element: An integer within the sequence.
  - Number_Zero: The integer 0, acting as empty space or a swappable/fillable element.
  - Number_Two: The integer 2, acting as a boundary or trigger for specific transformations.
  - Non_Zero_Non_Two_Element (X): Any integer element that is not 0 and not 2.
  - Zero_Block: A contiguous sub-sequence containing only 0s.
  - Movable_Block (Y): A contiguous sub-sequence containing only Non_Zero_Non_Two_Elements.

Properties:
  - Position: The index (0-11) of an element in the sequence.
  - Value: The integer value of an element.
  - Adjacency: Elements at consecutive indices.
  - Contiguity: Elements forming an unbroken block.

Relationships/Patterns:
  - Pattern_Swap: A Non_Zero_Non_Two_Element `X` followed immediately by a 0, followed immediately by a 2 (sub-sequence `X, 0, 2`). Found by scanning left-to-right.
  - Pattern_Shift: The integer 2 followed immediately by a Zero_Block (of length >= 1), followed immediately by a Movable_Block `Y`. (sub-sequence `2, 0..., 0, Y`). Found by scanning left-to-right for the initial '2'.

Actions:
  - Scan: Iterate through the sequence (typically left-to-right) to find the first occurrence of a pattern.
  - Identify: Recognize occurrences of Pattern_Swap or Pattern_Shift.
  - Apply_Swap: If Pattern_Swap is found first, swap the positions of `X` and 0.
  - Apply_Shift: If Pattern_Shift is found first (and Pattern_Swap was not found), move the Movable_Block `Y` to the position immediately following the '2', and place the Zero_Block immediately after the moved `Y`.
  - Halt: Stop processing and return the modified sequence after the first applicable action (Swap or Shift) is performed.
  - No_Change: If neither pattern is found during the scan, return the original sequence unmodified.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input as a list of 12 integers. Create a mutable copy of this list to potentially modify.
2.  Scan the list from left to right (index `i` from 0 up to length-3). Check if the sub-sequence starting at index `i` matches the pattern `X, 0, 2`, where `X` is any integer other than 0 or 2.
3.  If the first occurrence of the `X, 0, 2` pattern is found at index `i`:
    a.  Swap the elements at index `i` (the value `X`) and index `i+1` (the value 0).
    b.  Stop scanning. The transformation is complete. Return the modified list.
4.  If the `X, 0, 2` pattern is *not* found anywhere in the list after scanning:
    a.  Scan the list again from left to right (index `i` from 0 up to length-1) to find the first occurrence of the integer 2.
    b.  If a 2 is found at index `idx_2`, check the elements immediately following it.
    c.  Identify the contiguous block of one or more zeros starting at `idx_2 + 1`. Let the number of zeros be `num_zeros`.
    d.  Immediately after this block of zeros, identify the contiguous block `Y` consisting only of non-zero, non-2 integers. Check that such a block `Y` exists and is not empty.
    e.  If such a pattern `2, (zeros), Y` is found (where `num_zeros >= 1` and `Y` is valid and non-empty):
        i.  Construct the new sequence: Take the elements up to and including the `2` (from index 0 to `idx_2`). Append the block `Y`. Append `num_zeros` zeros. Append any remaining elements from the original list that came *after* the original position of block `Y`.
        ii. Stop scanning. The transformation is complete. Return the newly constructed list.
5.  If neither the `X, 0, 2` pattern nor the `2, (zeros), Y` pattern is found and applied, return the original, unmodified input list.
