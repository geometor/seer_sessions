            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe primary issue identified is an input type mismatch. The previous code assumed the input was a string requiring parsing (`input_str.split()`), while the testing environment provided a data structure (likely a NumPy array or list) which does not have a `.split()` method. This caused the code to fail before the core transformation logic could be executed.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  **Correct Input Handling:** Modify the approach to directly accept a list or array of integers as input, eliminating the need for string parsing and formatting functions (`parse_input`, `format_output`) within the core `transform` logic.\n2.  **Validate Core Logic:** Re-examine the previously defined transformation rules against all provided training examples, assuming the input is correctly handled as a list of integers. The initial walkthrough suggests the two-pattern logic (`X, 0, 2` swap prioritized over `2, 0..., 0, Y` shift) holds for the examples.\n3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and the natural language program to reflect the correct input object type (list/array of integers) and confirm the details of the transformation rules based on the re-evaluation.\n\n## Metrics and Rule Validation\n\nBased on a manual walkthrough and simulation of the intended logic (ignoring the original parsing error), the two core rules appear to cover the training examples:\n\n1.  **Rule 1 (Swap):** Find the first instance of `X, 0, 2` where `X` is not 0 and not 2. Swap `X` and `0` -> `0, X, 2`. Stop.\n2.  **Rule 2 (Shift):** If Rule 1 doesn't apply, find the first instance of `2, 0..., 0, Y` where there's at least one 0, and `Y` is a non-empty contiguous block of digits that are not 0 or 2. Move block `Y` immediately after the `2`, followed by the original intervening zeros. Stop.\n3.  **Default:** If neither rule applies, return the input unchanged.\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n"
