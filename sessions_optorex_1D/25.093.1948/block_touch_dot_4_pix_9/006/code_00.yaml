Task: Rearrange elements in a sequence based on prioritized local patterns involving 0 and 2.

Objects:
  - Sequence: A list of 12 integers.
  - Element: An integer within the sequence.
  - Number_Zero: The integer 0, acting as empty space or a swappable/movable element.
  - Number_Two: The integer 2, acting as a boundary or condition trigger.
  - Movable_Element (X): Any integer element where `X != 0` and `X != 2`.
  - Zero_Block: A contiguous sub-sequence containing one or more `0`s.
  - Movable_Block (Y): A contiguous, non-empty sub-sequence containing only Movable_Elements (integers `!= 0` and `!= 2`).

Properties:
  - Position: The index of an element in the sequence.
  - Value: The integer value of an element.
  - Adjacency: Elements immediately next to each other.
  - Contiguity: Elements forming an unbroken sequence.
  - Precedence: The order in which patterns are searched for and applied (Pattern 1 before Pattern 2).
  - First Occurrence: The rule applies only to the leftmost instance of a pattern found.

Relationships/Patterns:
  - Pattern_Swap: A Movable_Element `X` followed immediately by `0`, followed immediately by `2` (sub-sequence `X, 0, 2`).
  - Pattern_Shift: `2` followed immediately by a Zero_Block (`0...0`), followed immediately by a Movable_Block `Y` (sub-sequence `2, 0...0, Y`).

Actions:
  - Scan_Left_To_Right: Iterate through the sequence from index 0 upwards.
  - Identify_Pattern1: Find the first occurrence of Pattern_Swap.
  - Identify_Pattern2: Find the first occurrence of Pattern_Shift.
  - Execute_Swap: If Pattern_Swap is found first, exchange the positions of `X` and `0`.
  - Execute_Shift: If Pattern_Swap is not found and Pattern_Shift is found, move Movable_Block `Y` to the position immediately following `2`, and move the Zero_Block to the position immediately following the moved `Y`.
  - Halt: Stop processing and output the result after the first applicable transformation (either Swap or Shift).
  - No_Change: If neither Pattern_Swap nor Pattern_Shift is found anywhere in the sequence, output the original sequence unmodified.

Constraints:
  - Sequence length is fixed at 12.
  - Only the first matched pattern (considering priority) triggers an action.
