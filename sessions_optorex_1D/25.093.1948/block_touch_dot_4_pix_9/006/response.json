            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided information includes seven training examples and the results of executing a proposed Python function against them. The execution failed across all examples with a \"truth value of an array\" ambiguity error. This error likely stems from the testing environment or a subtle issue in how list comparisons or boolean logic was handled within the provided `transform` function, potentially involving numpy arrays implicitly or explicitly where standard Python lists were expected.\n\nHowever, the core task is to refine the understanding of the transformation rule itself based on the *input-output pairs*. The execution error does not invalidate the patterns observed in the data, but it means the previous code implementation was flawed or tested incorrectly.\n\nThe strategy is to re-analyze the input-output pairs to confirm or refine the identified patterns and their priorities, leading to an updated natural language program. The execution error will be ignored for the purpose of defining the transformation logic but should be noted for the coder phase.\n\n## Metrics and Example Analysis\n\n| Example | Input                      | Output                     | Change | Pattern Match      | Analysis                                                                                                                                                              |\n| :------ | :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :----- | :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| train_1 | `2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0`  | `2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`  | Yes    | Pattern 2 (Shift)  | `2` at index 0, followed by `0 0 0` (3 zeros), followed by `Y = [1, 1]` at index 4.

Shift `Y` after `2`, followed by the zeros: `2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0`.

Both patterns apply only to their *first* occurrence when scanning left-to-right. Pattern 2 requires a non-empty block `Y` (composed of digits != 0 and != 2) immediately following the zero(s).\n\n## Facts\n\n"
