*   **Perception of Elements:** The task operates on sequences of single digits. Each sequence contains the digit `2` exactly once. The sequences also contain blocks of identical non-zero digits and potentially zeros (`0`). The core transformation involves the digit `2` and its relationship with adjacent non-zero blocks and intervening zeros. In some cases, the input and output are identical, suggesting the transformation conditions are not met. In other cases, zeros located between the `2` and an adjacent block of non-zero digits are moved to the outer side of that block.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Rearrange digits in a sequence based on the position of '2'.

    Objects:
      - Sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
      - Digit '2': A unique marker within the sequence.
      - Non-Zero Block: A contiguous subsequence of identical digits greater than 0.
      - Intervening Zeros: Zeros located between the '2' and an adjacent Non-Zero Block.

    Properties:
      - Sequence: Has length, contains digits.
      - Digit '2': Has a specific index (position).
      - Non-Zero Block: Has a starting index, ending index, and a specific digit value.
      - Intervening Zeros: Have count and original positions.

    Relationships:
      - Adjacency: A Non-Zero Block can be adjacent to '2', potentially separated only by Intervening Zeros. Adjacency can be to the left or right of '2'.
      - Containment: Intervening Zeros are contained within the segment between '2' and the boundary of the adjacent Non-Zero Block.

    Actions:
      - Find: Locate the index of '2'.
      - Identify: Find Non-Zero Blocks adjacent (allowing for zeros) to '2'.
      - Collect: Gather Intervening Zeros between '2' and an adjacent Non-Zero Block.
      - Move: Relocate the collected Intervening Zeros to the outer side of the identified Non-Zero Block.
        - If the block is to the left of '2', move zeros to the position immediately before the block's start.
        - If the block is to the right of '2', move zeros to the position immediately after the block's end.
      - Reconstruct: Form the output sequence based on the moved elements.

    Conditionality:
      - The move action only occurs if Intervening Zeros exist between '2' and an adjacent Non-Zero Block.
      - If no such condition is met on either side of '2', the sequence remains unchanged.
      - The process checks one side (e.g., left) first. If a move occurs, the process may terminate without checking the other side (based on examples).
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Read the input sequence of digits.
    2.  Find the index position of the digit `2`.
    3.  Examine the segment of the sequence immediately to the left of the `2`. Scan leftwards from the position before the `2`.
    4.  Count and collect any consecutive `0`s found (`intervening_zeros`). Stop scanning left if a non-zero digit is encountered or the beginning of the sequence is reached.
    5.  If `intervening_zeros` were found AND a non-zero digit `d` was encountered immediately before them:
        a.  Identify the full contiguous block of `d` digits ending at this position (`adjacent_block`).
        b.  Remove the `intervening_zeros` from their original positions.
        c.  Insert the `intervening_zeros` into the sequence immediately before the start of the `adjacent_block`.
        d.  Output the modified sequence and terminate.
    6.  If no change was made in the previous steps, examine the segment of the sequence immediately to the right of the `2`. Scan rightwards from the position after the `2`.
    7.  Count and collect any consecutive `0`s found (`intervening_zeros`). Stop scanning right if a non-zero digit is encountered or the end of the sequence is reached.
    8.  If `intervening_zeros` were found AND a non-zero digit `d` was encountered immediately after them:
        a.  Identify the full contiguous block of `d` digits starting at this position (`adjacent_block`).
        b.  Remove the `intervening_zeros` from their original positions.
        c.  Insert the `intervening_zeros` into the sequence immediately after the end of the `adjacent_block`.
        d.  Output the modified sequence and terminate.
    9.  If no changes were made in any of the previous steps, output the original input sequence.

Transformation Rule Natural Language Description:

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits (as a list, array, or similar iterable). Convert it into a standard list of integers if necessary.
2.  Find the index (`idx2`) of the unique digit `2` in the sequence. If `2` is not present, return the original sequence formatted as a space-separated string.
3.  Check Left Side:
    a.  Scan leftwards from `idx2 - 1` counting consecutive `0`s (`zeros_left_count`).
    b.  If `zeros_left_count > 0`:
        i.  Determine the potential end index of the non-zero block: `block_end_idx = idx2 - zeros_left_count - 1`.
        ii. Check if `block_end_idx` is valid (>= 0) and if the digit at this index (`grid[block_end_idx]`) is non-zero (`block_digit`).
        iii. If it is a non-zero digit, scan further left from `block_end_idx` to find the start index (`block_start_idx`) of the contiguous block of `block_digit`.
        iv. If a valid block (`block_digit > 0`) is confirmed to end exactly at `block_end_idx`:
            1.  Extract the sequence segments: `before_block` (elements up to `block_start_idx`), `the_zeros` (elements from `block_end_idx + 1` to `idx2 - 1`), `the_block` (elements from `block_start_idx` to `block_end_idx`), `marker_and_after` (elements from `idx2` onwards).
            2.  Reconstruct the sequence as `before_block + the_zeros + the_block + marker_and_after`.
            3.  Format the reconstructed sequence as a space-separated string and return it.
4.  Check Right Side (only if no change was made on the left):
    a.  Initialize `zeros_right_count = 0`. Scan rightwards from `idx2 + 1`. While the index is valid and the digit is `0`, increment `zeros_right_count` and move one step right.
    b.  If `zeros_right_count > 0`:
        i.  Determine the potential start index of the non-zero block: `block_start_idx = idx2 + zeros_right_count + 1`.
        ii. Check if `block_start_idx` is valid (< sequence length) and if the digit at this index (`grid[block_start_idx]`) is non-zero (`block_digit`).
        iii. If it is a non-zero digit, scan further right from `block_start_idx` to find the end index (`block_end_idx`) of the contiguous block of `block_digit`.
        iv. If a valid block (`block_digit > 0`) is confirmed to start exactly at `block_start_idx`:
            1.  Extract the sequence segments: `up_to_marker` (elements up to `idx2`), `the_zeros` (elements from `idx2 + 1` to `block_start_idx - 1`), `the_block` (elements from `block_start_idx` to `block_end_idx`), `after_block` (elements from `block_end_idx + 1` onwards).
            2.  Reconstruct the sequence as `up_to_marker + the_block + the_zeros + after_block`.
            3.  Format the reconstructed sequence as a space-separated string and return it.
5.  No Change: If neither the left nor the right pattern resulted in a transformation, format the original input sequence as a space-separated string and return it.

```
*   **General Assessment:**
    The primary issue causing the errors is an input type mismatch. The `transform` function was written expecting a space-separated string as input, based on the initial examples' format. However, the test execution environment provided the input as a NumPy ndarray (specifically, `[[...]]`, suggesting a 2D array with one row). The core transformation logic, which involves finding the digit `2`, identifying adjacent zeros and non-zero blocks, and rearranging them, has not been tested due to this initial parsing failure. The strategy is to modify the input handling section of the `transform` function to correctly interpret the NumPy array, extract the 1D sequence of digits from it, and then apply the existing transformation logic. The logic itself, based on the previous analysis, seems plausible for the provided examples.

*   **Metrics:**
    The execution failed during the input parsing stage for all examples. Therefore, metrics about the internal steps (finding '2', identifying blocks/zeros, performing moves) cannot be gathered from the failed execution trace. However, we can re-verify the expected behavior based on the previously deduced rule for each example:

    *   **train_1:** Input `[0 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0]`. `idx2 = 7`. Right side: Zeros exist (`[0 0 0 0]`), but no non-zero block follows. Left side: No zeros adjacent to `2`. Expected: No change. Output: `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0`. Matches expectation.
    *   **train_2:** Input `[6 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. `idx2 = 1`. Right side: Zeros exist, but no non-zero block follows. Left side: Block `[6]` exists, but no zeros between it and `2`. Expected: No change. Output: `6 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. Matches expectation.
    *   **train_3:** Input `[0 0 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5]`. `idx2 = 2`. Right side: Block `[5 ... 5]` exists, but no zeros between it and `2`. Left side: Zeros exist `[0 0]`, but no non-zero block precedes them. Expected: No change. Output: `0 0 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`. Matches expectation.
    *   **train_4:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3]`. `idx2 = 7`. Right side: Block `[3 3 3 3]` exists, but no zeros between it and `2`. Left side: Zeros exist `[0 ... 0]`, but no non-zero block precedes them. Expected: No change. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3`. Matches expectation.
    *   **train_5:** Input `[5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0]`. `idx2 = 9`. Left side: Zeros `[0 0 0 0]` exist (`zeros_left_count=4`). Preceded by block `[5 5 5 5 5]` (ends at index 4). Pattern `Block - Zeros - 2` found. Move zeros `[0 0 0 0]` before block start (index 0). Expected: `0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 2 0 0`. Matches expectation.
    *   **train_6:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 0]`. `idx2 = 7`. Left side: Zero `[0]` exists (`zeros_left_count=1`). Preceded by block `[4]` (ends at index 5). Pattern `Block - Zero - 2` found. Move zero `[0]` before block start (index 5). Expected: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 0`. Matches expectation.
    *   **train_7:** Input `[2 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0]`. `idx2 = 0`. Left side: N/A. Right side: Zero `[0]` exists (`zeros_right_count=1`). Followed by block `[5 ... 5]` (starts at index 2). Pattern `2 - Zero - Block` found. Move zero `[0]` after block end (index 10). Expected: `2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0`. Matches expectation.
    *   **test_1:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 2 0]`. `idx2 = 10`. Left side: Zero `[0]` exists (`zeros_left_count=1`). Preceded by block `[6 6 6 6]` (ends at index 8). Pattern `Block - Zero - 2` found. Move zero `[0]` before block start (index 5). Expected: `0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 2 0`.

    The analysis confirms the previously derived rule seems correct and covers all examples. The primary task is fixing the input handling.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    Task: Rearrange digits in a sequence based on the position of '2'.

    Input_Format: Typically a 1D sequence of integers, potentially provided within a nested structure (e.g., single-row 2D NumPy array). Needs robust parsing.

    Objects:
      - Sequence: A 1D list of single-digit integers derived from the input.
      - Digit '2': The unique marker digit within the sequence.
      - Non_Zero_Block: A contiguous subsequence of identical digits (value > 0).
      - Intervening_Zeros: A contiguous subsequence of one or more '0's located directly between the '2' and an adjacent Non_Zero_Block.

    Properties:
      - Sequence: Has length `n`. Elements are integers.
      - Digit '2': Has a unique index `idx2`.
      - Non_Zero_Block: Has a start index, end index, and a digit value `d > 0`.
      - Intervening_Zeros: Has a count (`> 0`) and occupies a specific range of indices.

    Relationships:
      - Adjacency_Pattern_Left: Non_Zero_Block ends at index `k`, Intervening_Zeros occupy indices `k+1` to `idx2-1`. Requires `k >= 0` and `idx2 > k+1`.
      - Adjacency_Pattern_Right: Intervening_Zeros occupy indices `idx2+1` to `k-1`, Non_Zero_Block starts at index `k`. Requires `k < n` and `k > idx2+1`.

    Actions:
      - Parse_Input: Convert the raw input (e.g., NumPy array, string) into a 1D list of integers.
      - Find_Marker: Locate the index `idx2` of the digit `2`.
      - Scan_Left: Check for Intervening_Zeros immediately left of `idx2`, then check for a Non_Zero_Block immediately left of those zeros.
      - Scan_Right: Check for Intervening_Zeros immediately right of `idx2`, then check for a Non_Zero_Block immediately right of those zeros.
      - Move_Zeros_Left_Case: If the Left pattern is found, reconstruct the sequence by moving the Intervening_Zeros to the position immediately before the Non_Zero_Block's start index.
      - Move_Zeros_Right_Case: If the Right pattern is found, reconstruct the sequence by moving the Intervening_Zeros to the position immediately after the Non_Zero_Block's end index.
      - Format_Output: Convert the final sequence (original or modified) back into a space-separated string.

    Conditionality:
      - The transformation occurs only if either the Adjacency_Pattern_Left or Adjacency_Pattern_Right is detected.
      - The Scan_Left check takes priority. If a move is performed based on the left side, the right side is not checked.
      - If neither pattern is found, the original sequence is returned.
      - Assumes '2' is always present exactly once.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  **Receive Input:** Accept the input data, which represents a sequence of digits. Anticipate formats like a list, NumPy array (potentially nested like `[[...]]`), or string.
    2.  **Parse to List:** Convert the input into a flat, 1D list of integers (`grid`). Handle potential nesting in arrays (e.g., extract the first row if it's `[[...]]`). If parsing fails, return an error indicator or the original input representation.
    3.  **Find Marker:** Locate the index (`idx2`) of the unique digit `2` within the `grid`. If `2` is not found, return the `grid` formatted as a space-separated string.
    4.  **Check Left Pattern:**
        a.  Scan leftwards from `idx2 - 1`. Count consecutive `0`s encountered (`zeros_left_count`). Let the index of the first non-zero digit (or -1 if sequence start is reached) be `block_end_check_idx`.
        b.  If `zeros_left_count > 0` and `block_end_check_idx >= 0` and `grid[block_end_check_idx]` is a non-zero digit (`block_digit`):
            i.  Find the full contiguous block of `block_digit` ending at `block_end_check_idx`. Let its start index be `block_start_idx`.
            ii. **Reconstruct:** Form a new list by concatenating:
                *   Elements from the start of `grid` up to (but not including) `block_start_idx`.
                *   The `zeros_left_count` zeros (originally from `block_end_check_idx + 1` to `idx2 - 1`).
                *   The non-zero block (from `block_start_idx` to `block_end_check_idx`).
                *   The digit `2` and all subsequent elements from the original `grid` (from `idx2` onwards).
            iii. Format the reconstructed list as a space-separated string and return it.
    5.  **Check Right Pattern (if no change on left):**
        a.  Scan rightwards from `idx2 + 1`. Count consecutive `0`s encountered (`zeros_right_count`). Let the index of the first non-zero digit (or `n` if sequence end is reached) be `block_start_check_idx`.
        b.  If `zeros_right_count > 0` and `block_start_check_idx < len(grid)` and `grid[block_start_check_idx]` is a non-zero digit (`block_digit`):
            i.  Find the full contiguous block of `block_digit` starting at `block_start_check_idx`. Let its end index be `block_end_idx`.
            ii. **Reconstruct:** Form a new list by concatenating:
                *   Elements from the start of `grid` up to and including `idx2`.
                *   The non-zero block (from `block_start_check_idx` to `block_end_idx`).
                *   The `zeros_right_count` zeros (originally from `idx2 + 1` to `block_start_check_idx - 1`).
                *   All subsequent elements from the original `grid` (from `block_end_idx + 1` onwards).
            iii. Format the reconstructed list as a space-separated string and return it.
    6.  **No Change:** If neither the left nor the right pattern resulted in a reconstruction, format the original `grid` list as a space-separated string and return it.
