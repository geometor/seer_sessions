**General Assessment:**

The primary issue identified is a runtime error (`'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) which suggests an incompatibility between the expected input format (space-separated string) of the `transform` function and the actual data type being passed during testing (likely a NumPy array). This is likely an artifact of the testing environment setup rather than a flaw in the core transformation logic derived from the examples.

The transformation logic itself, as described in the initial natural language program and implemented in the Python code, appears to correctly handle all the provided training examples. The rule involves locating the digit `2`, checking for adjacent sequences of `0`s immediately to its left or right, identifying a contiguous block of non-zero identical digits adjacent to those `0`s, and then moving the `0`s to the opposite side of that block. The operation prioritizes checking the left side first. If a transformation occurs on the left, the process terminates; otherwise, it checks the right side. If no applicable pattern (zeros next to `2` followed/preceded by a non-zero block) is found on either side, the sequence remains unchanged.

The strategy is to reaffirm the existing logic based on the examples, refine the descriptions (YAML, Natural Language Program) for maximum clarity, and assume the runtime error is external to the logical definition of the task.

**Metrics and Example Analysis:**

Let's analyze each training example based on the proposed logic:

*   **train_1:**
    *   Input: `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0`
    *   `2` index: 7
    *   Left check: No zeros immediately left of `2`. No change.
    *   Right check: Zeros `0 0 0 0` found (indices 8-11). No non-zero block follows the zeros. No change.
    *   Output: `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0` (Matches expected)
*   **train_2:**
    *   Input: `6 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
    *   `2` index: 1
    *   Left check: No zeros immediately left of `2`. No change.
    *   Right check: Zeros `0 0 ... 0` found (indices 2-11). No non-zero block follows the zeros. No change.
    *   Output: `6 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` (Matches expected)
*   **train_3:**
    *   Input: `0 0 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`

    *   Right check: No zeros immediately right of `2`. No change.
    *   Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3` (Matches expected)

    *   Input: `5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0`
    *   `2` index: 9
    *   Left check: Zeros `0 0 0 0` found (indices 5-8). Non-zero block `5 5 5 5 5` precedes the zeros (indices 0-4).
    *   Action: Move zeros `0 0 0 0` from indices 5-8 to before index 0.

    *   `2` index: 7
    *   Left check: Zero `0` found (index 6). Non-zero block `4` precedes the zero (index 5).
    *   Action: Move zero `0` from index 6 to before index 5.
    *   Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 0` (Matches expected)
*   **train_7:**
    *   Input: `2 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0`
    *   `2` index: 0
    *   Left check: N/A (start of sequence). No change.
    *   Right check: Zero `0` found (index 1). Non-zero block `5 5 ... 5` follows the zero (indices 2-10).

    *   Output: `2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0` (Matches expected)

**YAML Facts:**


```yaml
Task: Conditional rearrangement of zeros based on proximity to '2' and adjacent non-zero blocks.

Objects:
  - Sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
  - Marker: The digit '2', appearing exactly once.
  - Zero Run: A contiguous subsequence of one or more '0's.
  - Non-Zero Block: A contiguous subsequence of identical digits (1-9).

Properties:
  - Sequence: Has length, ordered elements.
  - Marker: Has a specific index (position).
  - Zero Run: Has a start index, end index, length. Can be adjacent to the Marker.
  - Non-Zero Block: Has a start index, end index, length, and a specific digit value. Can be adjacent to a Zero Run.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency (Marker-ZeroRun): A Zero Run can be immediately to the left or right of the Marker.
  - Adjacency (ZeroRun-Block): A Non-Zero Block can be immediately to the left of a Zero Run (which is left of Marker), or immediately to the right of a Zero Run (which is right of Marker).
  - Containment: The Marker, Zero Run, and Non-Zero Block form a specific pattern segment within the Sequence.

Actions:
  - Find Marker: Locate the index of '2'.
  - Scan Left: Check for a Zero Run immediately left of the Marker.
  - Identify Left Block: If a Zero Run is found left, check for a Non-Zero Block immediately left of that Zero Run.
  - Move Left: If the pattern (Block - ZeroRun - Marker) is found, relocate the Zero Run to the position immediately before the Block's start index.
  - Scan Right: If no move occurred left, check for a Zero Run immediately right of the Marker.
  - Identify Right Block: If a Zero Run is found right, check for a Non-Zero Block immediately right of that Zero Run.
  - Move Right: If the pattern (Marker - ZeroRun - Block) is found, relocate the Zero Run to the position immediately after the Block's end index.
  - Reconstruct: Form the output sequence after a potential move.

Conditionality:
  - A move occurs only if the specific pattern (Block-Zeros-2 or 2-Zeros-Block) is identified.
  - Left side check has priority. If a move occurs on the left, the right side is not checked.
  - If no move occurs on either side, the sequence remains unchanged.

**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits.
2.  Find the index (`idx2`) of the digit `2`.
3.  **Check Left:**
    a.  Initialize `zeros_left_count = 0`. Scan leftwards from `idx2 - 1`. While the current digit is `0` and within bounds, increment `zeros_left_count` and continue scanning left.
    b.  If `zeros_left_count > 0`:
        i.  Determine the index (`block_end_idx`) immediately preceding the leftmost zero found: `block_end_idx = idx2 - zeros_left_count - 1`.
        ii. If `block_end_idx` is valid (>= 0) and the digit at `block_end_idx` is non-zero (`block_digit`):
            1.  Find the start index (`block_start_idx`) of the contiguous block of `block_digit` ending at `block_end_idx`.
            2.  Construct the new sequence by taking elements before `block_start_idx`, followed by the `zeros_left_count` zeros, followed by the block (from `block_start_idx` to `block_end_idx`), followed by the rest of the sequence starting from `idx2`.
            3.  Output the reconstructed sequence and terminate.
4.  **Check Right (only if no change was made in step 3):**
    a.  Initialize `zeros_right_count = 0`. Scan rightwards from `idx2 + 1`. While the current digit is `0` and within bounds, increment `zeros_right_count` and continue scanning right.
    b.  If `zeros_right_count > 0`:
        i.  Determine the index (`block_start_idx`) immediately following the rightmost zero found: `block_start_idx = idx2 + zeros_right_count + 1`.
        ii. If `block_start_idx` is valid (< sequence length) and the digit at `block_start_idx` is non-zero (`block_digit`):
            1.  Find the end index (`block_end_idx`) of the contiguous block of `block_digit` starting at `block_start_idx`.
            2.  Construct the new sequence by taking elements up to and including `idx2`, followed by the block (from `block_start_idx` to `block_end_idx`), followed by the `zeros_right_count` zeros, followed by the rest of the sequence starting after `block_end_idx`.
            3.  Output the reconstructed sequence and terminate.
5.  If no changes were made in steps 3 or 4, output the original input sequence.
