Task: Conditional rearrangement of zeros based on proximity to '2' and adjacent non-zero blocks.

Objects:
  - Sequence: A list of single-digit integers.
  - Marker: The digit '2', appearing exactly once.
  - Zero Run: A contiguous subsequence of one or more '0's.
  - Non-Zero Block: A contiguous subsequence of identical digits (1-9).

Properties:
  - Sequence: Has length, ordered elements.
  - Marker: Has a specific index (position).
  - Zero Run: Has a start index, end index, length. Can be adjacent to the Marker.
  - Non-Zero Block: Has a start index, end index, length, and a specific digit value. Can be adjacent to a Zero Run.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency (Marker-ZeroRun): A Zero Run can be immediately to the left or right of the Marker.
  - Adjacency (ZeroRun-Block): A Non-Zero Block can be immediately to the left of a Zero Run (which is left of Marker), or immediately to the right of a Zero Run (which is right of Marker).
  - Containment: The Marker, Zero Run, and Non-Zero Block form a specific pattern segment within the Sequence.

Actions:
  - Find Marker: Locate the index of '2'.
  - Scan Left: Check for a Zero Run immediately left of the Marker.
  - Identify Left Block: If a Zero Run is found left, check for a Non-Zero Block immediately left of that Zero Run.
  - Move Left: If the pattern (Block - ZeroRun - Marker) is found, relocate the Zero Run to the position immediately before the Block's start index.
  - Scan Right: If no move occurred left, check for a Zero Run immediately right of the Marker.
  - Identify Right Block: If a Zero Run is found right, check for a Non-Zero Block immediately right of that Zero Run.
  - Move Right: If the pattern (Marker - ZeroRun - Block) is found, relocate the Zero Run to the position immediately after the Block's end index.
  - Reconstruct: Form the output sequence after a potential move.

Conditionality:
  - A move occurs only if the specific pattern (Block-Zeros-2 or 2-Zeros-Block) is identified.
  - Left side check has priority. If a move occurs on the left, the right side is not checked.
  - If no move occurs on either side, the sequence remains unchanged.
