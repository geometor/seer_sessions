The `transform` function was written expecting a space-separated string as input, based on the initial examples' format. However, the test execution environment provided the input as a NumPy ndarray (specifically, `[[...]]`, suggesting a 2D array with one row). The core transformation logic, which involves finding the digit `2`, identifying adjacent zeros and non-zero blocks, and rearranging them, has not been tested due to this initial parsing failure. The strategy is to modify the input handling section of the `transform` function to correctly interpret the NumPy array, extract the 1D sequence of digits from it, and then apply the existing transformation logic. The logic itself, based on the previous analysis, seems plausible for the provided examples.\n\n*   **Metrics:**\n    The execution failed during the input parsing stage for all examples. Therefore, metrics about the internal steps (finding '2', identifying blocks/zeros, performing moves) cannot be gathered from the failed execution trace. However, we can re-verify the expected behavior based on the previously deduced rule for each example:\n\n    *   **train_1:** Input `[0 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0]`. `idx2 = 7`. Right side: Zeros exist (`[0 0 0 0]`), but no non-zero block follows. Left side: No zeros adjacent to `2`. Expected: No change. Output: `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0`. Matches expectation.\n    *   **train_2:** Input `[6 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`. `idx2 = 1`. Right side: Zeros exist, but no non-zero block follows. Left side: Block `[6]` exists, but no zeros between it and `2`. Expected: No change. Output: `6 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`. Matches expectation.\n    *   **train_3:** Input `[0 0 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5]`. `idx2 = 2`. Right side: Block `[5 ... 5]` exists, but no zeros between it and `2`. Left side: Zeros exist `[0 0]`, but no non-zero block precedes them. Expected: No change. Output: `0 0 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`. Matches expectation.\n    *   **train_4:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3]`. `idx2 = 7`. Right side: Block `[3 3 3 3]` exists, but no zeros between it and `2`. Left side: Zeros exist `[0 ... 0]`, but no non-zero block precedes them. Expected: No change. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3`. Matches expectation.\n    *   **train_5:** Input `[5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0]`. `idx2 = 9`. Left side: Zeros `[0 0 0 0]` exist (`zeros_left_count=4`). Preceded by block `[5 5 5 5 5]` (ends at index 4). Pattern `Block - Zeros - 2` found. Move zeros `[0 0 0 0]` before block start (index 0). Expected: `0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 2 0 0`. Matches expectation.\n    *   **train_6:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 0]`. `idx2 = 7`. Left side: Zero `[0]` exists (`zeros_left_count=1`). Preceded by block `[4]` (ends at index 5). Pattern `Block - Zero - 2` found. Move zero `[0]` before block start (index 5). Expected: `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 0`. Matches expectation.\n    *   **train_7:** Input `[2 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0]`. `idx2 = 0`. Left side: N/A. Right side: Zero `[0]` exists (`zeros_right_count=1`). Followed by block `[5 ... 5]` (starts at index 2). Pattern `2 - Zero - Block` found. Move zero `[0]` after block end (index 10). Expected: `2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0`. Matches expectation.\n    *   **test_1:** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 2 0]`. `idx2 = 10`. Left side: Zero `[0]` exists (`zeros_left_count=1`). Preceded by block `[6 6 6 6]` (ends at index 8). Pattern `Block - Zero - 2` found. Move zero `[0]` before block start (index 5). Expected: `0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 2 0`.\n\n    The analysis confirms the previously derived rule seems correct and covers all examples. The primary task is fixing the input handling.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Needs robust parsing.\n\n    Objects:\n      - Sequence: A 1D list of single-digit integers derived from the input.\n      - Digit '2': The unique marker digit within the sequence.\n      - Non_Zero_Block: A contiguous subsequence of identical digits (value > 0).\n      - Intervening_Zeros: A contiguous subsequence of one or more '0's located directly between the '2' and an adjacent Non_Zero_Block.\n\n    Properties:\n      - Sequence: Has length `n`. Elements are integers.\n      - Digit '2': Has a unique index `idx2`.\n      - Non_Zero_Block: Has a start index, end index, and a digit value `d > 0`.\n      - Intervening_Zeros: Has a count (`> 0`) and occupies a specific range of indices.\n\n    Relationships:\n      - Adjacency_Pattern_Left: Non_Zero_Block ends at index `k`, Intervening_Zeros occupy indices `k+1` to `idx2-1`. Requires `k >= 0` and `idx2 > k+1`.\n      - Adjacency_Pattern_Right: Intervening_Zeros occupy indices `idx2+1` to `k-1`, Non_Zero_Block starts at index `k`. Requires `k < n` and `k > idx2+1`.\n\n    Actions:\n      - Parse_Input: Convert the raw input (e.g., NumPy array, string) into a 1D list of integers.\n      - Find_Marker: Locate the index `idx2` of the digit `2`.\n      - Scan_Left: Check for Intervening_Zeros immediately left of `idx2`, then check for a Non_Zero_Block immediately left of those zeros.\n      - Scan_Right: Check for Intervening_Zeros immediately right of `idx2`, then check for a Non_Zero_Block immediately right of those zeros.\n      - Move_Zeros_Left_Case: If the Left pattern is found, reconstruct the sequence by moving the Intervening_Zeros to the position immediately before the Non_Zero_Block's start index.\n      - Move_Zeros_Right_Case: If the Right pattern is found, reconstruct the sequence by moving the Intervening_Zeros to the position immediately after the Non_Zero_Block's end index.\n      - Format_Output: Convert the final sequence (original or modified) back into a space-separated string.\n\n    Conditionality:\n      - The transformation occurs only if either the Adjacency_Pattern_Left or Adjacency_Pattern_Right is detected.\n      - The Scan_Left check takes priority. If a move is performed based on the left side, the right side is not checked.\n      - If neither pattern is found, the original sequence is returned.\n      - Assumes '2' is always present exactly once.\n    ```"
