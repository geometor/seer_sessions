The sequences also contain blocks of identical non-zero digits and potentially zeros (`0`). The core transformation involves the digit `2` and its relationship with adjacent non-zero blocks and intervening zeros. In some cases, the input and output are identical, suggesting the transformation conditions are not met. In other cases, zeros located between the `2` and an adjacent block of non-zero digits are moved to the outer side of that block.\n\n*   **YAML Facts:**\n    "

Adjacency can be to the left or right of '2'.\n      - Containment: Intervening Zeros are contained within the segment between '2' and the boundary of the adjacent Non-Zero Block.\n\n    Actions:\n      - Find: Locate the index of '2'.\n      - Identify: Find Non-Zero Blocks adjacent (allowing for zeros) to '2'.\n      - Collect: Gather Intervening Zeros between '2' and an adjacent Non-Zero Block.\n      - Move: Relocate the collected Intervening Zeros to the outer side of the identified Non-Zero Block.\n        - If the block is to the left of '2', move zeros to the position immediately before the block's start.\n        - If the block is to the right of '2', move zeros to the position immediately after the block's end.\n      - Reconstruct: Form the output sequence based on the moved elements.\n\n    Conditionality:\n      - The move action only occurs if Intervening Zeros exist between '2' and an adjacent Non-Zero Block.\n      - If no such condition is met on either side of '2', the sequence remains unchanged.\n      - The process checks one side (e.g., left) first. If a move occurs, the process may terminate without checking the other side (based on examples).\n    ```"
