## General Assessment and Strategy

The primary issue identified is a `TypeError: only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`. This error occurs during the parsing of the input within the `transform` function (`grid = [int(d) for d in input_str.split()]`). This indicates that the `input_str` parameter is not always a space-separated string as initially assumed, but likely an iterable of numbers (potentially NumPy arrays or lists) provided by the testing environment. The previous code attempted to handle this with a `try-except` block, but the error persists, suggesting the handling needs refinement or the input type is still misunderstood.

The transformation logic itself, based on the examples, appears to involve moving sequences of zeros situated between the unique digit `2` and an adjacent block of identical non-zero digits. The zeros are moved to the outside of the adjacent block. The examples show this move happens either to the left of `2` (Examples 5, 6) or to the right (Example 7), but not both. Examples 1-4 show no change, confirming the conditions for the move (presence of *both* intervening zeros *and* an adjacent block) are necessary. Example 5 vs. 7 suggests a directionality or priority might exist (checking left before right seems consistent).

**Strategy:**

1.  **Fix Input Handling:** Modify the input parsing in the `transform` function to correctly handle inputs whether they are strings or iterables of numbers (like lists or NumPy arrays). Avoid `.split()` if the input isn't a string. Ensure direct conversion to a list of integers.
2.  **Refine Logic:** Confirm the transformation rule based on all examples:
    *   Locate the digit `2`.
    *   Check for the pattern `[Block of d] [Zeros] [2]` to the left. If found, move the zeros before the block: `[Zeros] [Block of d] [2]`.
    *   If no change was made on the left, check for the pattern `[2] [Zeros] [Block of d]` to the right. If found, move the zeros after the block: `[2] [Block of d] [Zeros]`.
    *   If neither pattern is found, return the original sequence.
3.  **Update Documentation:** Revise the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the refined understanding of input handling and transformation logic.

## Metrics and Example Analysis

Let's re-analyze the examples focusing on the pattern `(Non-Zero Block) - (Zeros) - (2)` or `(2) - (Zeros) - (Non-Zero Block)`.

*   **train_1:** `0 7 7 7 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0`
    *   `idx2 = 7`
    *   Left: `... 7 7 | 2 ...` (No intervening zeros).
    *   Right: `... 2 | 0 0 0 0` (Intervening zeros, but no non-zero block follows).
    *   Result: No change. Correct.
*   **train_2:** `6 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
    *   `idx2 = 1`
    *   Left: `6 | 2 ...` (No intervening zeros).
    *   Right: `... 2 | 0 0 ...` (Intervening zeros, but no non-zero block follows).
    *   Result: No change. Correct.
*   **train_3:** `0 0 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5`
    *   `idx2 = 2`
    *   Left: `0 0 | 2 ...` (Ends in zero, no block-zero-2 pattern).
    *   Right: `... 2 | 5 5 ...` (No intervening zeros).
    *   Result: No change. Correct.
*   **train_4:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3`
    *   `idx2 = 7`
    *   Left: `... 0 | 2 ...` (Ends in zero, no block-zero-2 pattern).
    *   Right: `... 2 | 3 3 ...` (No intervening zeros).
    *   Result: No change. Correct.
*   **train_5:** `5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0` -> `0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 2 0 0`
    *   `idx2 = 9`
    *   Left: `5 5 5 5 5 | 0 0 0 0 | 2 ...` (Block `5`s, Zeros `0000`, `2`). Pattern found.
    *   Action: Move `0000` before the `55555` block.
    *   Result: Change. Correct.
*   **train_6:** `0 0 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 0` -> `0 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 0 0 0 0`
    *   `idx2 = 7`
    *   Left: `... 0 4 | 0 | 2 ...` (Block `4`, Zero `0`, `2`). Pattern found.
    *   Action: Move `0` before the `4` block.
    *   Result: Change. Correct.
*   **train_7:** `2 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0` -> `2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0`
    *   `idx2 = 0`
    *   Left: N/A.
    *   Right: `2 | 0 | 5 5 ...` ( `2`, Zero `0`, Block `5`s). Pattern found.
    *   Action: Move `0` after the `555555555` block.
    *   Result: Change. Correct.

The analysis confirms the rule: Find the `2`. Check left for `Block - Zeros - 2`. If found, move Zeros left of Block and finish. Otherwise, check right for `2 - Zeros - Block`. If found, move Zeros right of Block.

## Updated YAML Facts


```yaml
Task: Rearrange sequences containing the digit '2'.

Input_Format: An iterable (list, array, etc.) of single-digit integers.

Output_Format: A space-separated string of single-digit integers representing the transformed sequence.

Objects:
  - Sequence: The list of input digits.
  - Marker: The unique digit '2'.
  - Zero Sequence: A contiguous sub-sequence containing only the digit '0'.
  - Non-Zero Block: A contiguous sub-sequence of identical digits `d` where `d > 0`.

Relationships:
  - Adjacency (Pattern): The core patterns involve the Marker ('2'), a Zero Sequence, and a Non-Zero Block appearing contiguously in one of two orders:
    1. Left Pattern: `Non-Zero Block` immediately followed by `Zero Sequence` immediately followed by `Marker`.
    2. Right Pattern: `Marker` immediately followed by `Zero Sequence` immediately followed by `Non-Zero Block`.

Actions:
  - Find Marker: Locate the index of the '2' digit.
  - Scan Left: Check if the Left Pattern exists immediately to the left of the Marker's position.
  - Scan Right: Check if the Right Pattern exists immediately to the right of the Marker's position.
  - Identify Components: If a pattern is found, identify the specific `Non-Zero Block` and `Zero Sequence` involved.
  - Reconstruct: Create the output sequence by moving the identified `Zero Sequence`.
    - For Left Pattern: Move the `Zero Sequence` to the position immediately *before* the identified `Non-Zero Block`.
    - For Right Pattern: Move the `Zero Sequence` to the position immediately *after* the identified `Non-Zero Block`.

Priority:
  - The Left Pattern check takes precedence. If the Left Pattern is found and the sequence is reconstructed, the process terminates.
  - The Right Pattern is checked only if the Left Pattern was not found.

Conditionality:
  - Transformation occurs *only* if either the Left Pattern or the Right Pattern is found.
  - If neither pattern is present, the original sequence is returned unchanged.

## Updated Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input sequence of digits (as a list, array, or similar iterable). Convert it into a standard list of integers if necessary.
2.  Find the index (`idx2`) of the unique digit `2` in the sequence. If `2` is not present, return the original sequence formatted as a space-separated string.
3.  **Check Left Side:**
    a.  Initialize `zeros_left_count = 0`. Scan leftwards from `idx2 - 1`. While the index is valid and the digit is `0`, increment `zeros_left_count` and move one step left.
    b.  If `zeros_left_count > 0`:
        i.  Determine the potential end index of the non-zero block: `block_end_idx = idx2 - zeros_left_count - 1`.
        ii. Check if `block_end_idx` is valid (>= 0) and if the digit at this index (`grid[block_end_idx]`) is non-zero (`block_digit`).
        iii. If it is a non-zero digit, scan further left from `block_end_idx` to find the start index (`block_start_idx`) of the contiguous block of `block_digit`.
        iv. If a valid block (`block_digit > 0`) is confirmed to end exactly at `block_end_idx`:
            1.  Extract the sequence segments: `before_block` (elements up to `block_start_idx`), `the_zeros` (elements from `block_end_idx + 1` to `idx2 - 1`), `the_block` (elements from `block_start_idx` to `block_end_idx`), `marker_and_after` (elements from `idx2` onwards).
            2.  Reconstruct the sequence as `before_block + the_zeros + the_block + marker_and_after`.
            3.  Format the reconstructed sequence as a space-separated string and return it.
4.  **Check Right Side (only if no change was made on the left):**
    a.  Initialize `zeros_right_count = 0`. Scan rightwards from `idx2 + 1`. While the index is valid and the digit is `0`, increment `zeros_right_count` and move one step right.
    b.  If `zeros_right_count > 0`:
        i.  Determine the potential start index of the non-zero block: `block_start_idx = idx2 + zeros_right_count + 1`.
        ii. Check if `block_start_idx` is valid (< sequence length) and if the digit at this index (`grid[block_start_idx]`) is non-zero (`block_digit`).
        iii. If it is a non-zero digit, scan further right from `block_start_idx` to find the end index (`block_end_idx`) of the contiguous block of `block_digit`.
        iv. If a valid block (`block_digit > 0`) is confirmed to start exactly at `block_start_idx`:
            1.  Extract the sequence segments: `up_to_marker` (elements up to `idx2`), `the_zeros` (elements from `idx2 + 1` to `block_start_idx - 1`), `the_block` (elements from `block_start_idx` to `block_end_idx`), `after_block` (elements from `block_end_idx + 1` onwards).
            2.  Reconstruct the sequence as `up_to_marker + the_block + the_zeros + after_block`.
            3.  Format the reconstructed sequence as a space-separated string and return it.
5.  **No Change:** If neither the left nor the right pattern resulted in a transformation, format the original input sequence as a space-separated string and return it.
