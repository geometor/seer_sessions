"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of integers (potentially provided as a 2D 1xN array) 
by preserving only the first and last elements of contiguous blocks of identical 
non-zero numbers longer than two elements. The middle elements of such blocks 
(between the first and last) are changed to zero. Original zeros and blocks 
of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged.
