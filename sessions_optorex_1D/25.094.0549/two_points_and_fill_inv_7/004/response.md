## General Assessment and Strategy

The provided code implements the core logic described in the initial analysis: identify contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers and replace the interior elements of blocks longer than two with zeros. The code correctly handles the examples when traced manually assuming a 1D list or array input.

However, the consistent error "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" across all examples strongly suggests that the `transform` function, specifically within the `find_blocks` helper function, is receiving input data in an unexpected format. The most likely cause is that the input `sequence` variable inside `find_blocks` is not iterating over scalar integers but over NumPy arrays. This would happen if the `input_sequence` passed to `transform` is a 2D NumPy array (e.g., shape `(1, 12)`) instead of a 1D array (shape `(12,)`). When iterating over a 2D array like `np.array([[0, 2, ...]])`, the loop variable `value` becomes the entire row `np.array([0, 2, ...])`. Comparisons like `value != 0` then produce a boolean array (e.g., `[False, True, ...]`), which cannot be evaluated directly in an `if` condition, leading to the observed error.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Shape:** Assume the testing framework might provide the input as a 2D NumPy array with a single row (shape `(1, N)`).
2.  **Adapt Code:** Modify the `transform` function to explicitly handle this potential 2D input by selecting the first row to ensure a 1D array is processed by `find_blocks`. Add a check for this shape.
3.  **Validate Logic:** The core transformation logic (finding blocks, checking length > 2, zeroing out the middle) appears correct based on the examples and should remain unchanged.
4.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to explicitly state the assumption of processing a 1D sequence and mention the potential need to extract this 1D sequence from a 2D input container.

## Metrics and Analysis

The code fails consistently across all training and test examples with the same NumPy ambiguity error. This indicates the problem is not specific to certain data patterns (like block length or position) but rather a fundamental issue with how the input data interacts with the comparison operations (`!=`) within the `find_blocks` function's loop, likely due to unexpected input dimensionality.

*   **Example 1 (Train):** Input `[0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0]`, Output `[0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0]`. Block (2, 1, 8), length 8. Should zero out indices 2 through 7. Fails due to ambiguity error.
*   **Example 2 (Train):** Input `[0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0]`, Output `[0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0]`. Block (3, 1, 9), length 9. Should zero out indices 2 through 8. Fails due to ambiguity error.
*   **Example 3 (Train):** Input `[0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0]`, Output `[0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0]`. Block (3, 4, 6), length 3. Should zero out index 5. Fails due to ambiguity error.
*   **Example 4 (Train):** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0]`, Output `[0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0]`. Block (9, 5, 9), length 5. Should zero out indices 6 through 8. Fails due to ambiguity error.
*   **Example 5 (Train):** Input `[3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0]`, Output `[3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0]`. Block (3, 0, 10), length 11. Should zero out indices 1 through 9. Fails due to ambiguity error.
*   **Example 6 (Train):** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0]`, Output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 0 0]`. Block (4, 6, 8), length 3. Should zero out index 7. Fails due to ambiguity error.
*   **Example 7 (Train):** Input `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0]`, Output `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0]`. Block (9, 8, 9), length 2. Should remain unchanged. Fails due to ambiguity error.

The consistency of the error across blocks of varying lengths (2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11) and positions reinforces the hypothesis of an input format issue rather than a flaw in the block processing logic itself.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_element_type: integer (within a sequence)
output_element_type: integer (within a sequence)
dimensionality: Assumed 1D sequence for processing, potentially provided as 2D (1xN) requiring extraction.
sequence_length: fixed (12 in examples)
objects:
  - sequence: A 1D list or NumPy array of integers.
  - block: A contiguous sub-sequence within the 1D sequence consisting of identical, non-zero integers.
  - zero: The integer 0, acting as a separator or unchanged element.
properties:
  - block:
      - value: The non-zero integer comprising the block.
      - start_index: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the 1D sequence.
      - end_index: The 0-based index of the last element of the block in the 1D sequence.
      - length: The number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
relationships:
  - Blocks are contiguous segments within the main 1D sequence.
  - Blocks are separated by zeros or sequence boundaries.
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by modifying elements within certain blocks.
actions:
  - prepare_input: Ensure the input is treated as a 1D sequence (e.g., by selecting the first row if input is 2D 1xN).
  - identify_blocks: Iterate through the 1D sequence to find all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers, recording their value, start index, and end index.
  - process_blocks: For each identified block:
      - check_length: Determine the block's length.
      - modify_if_long: If the block length is strictly greater than 2:
          - zero_out_middle: Replace the elements in the sequence *between* the start and end indices (i.e., from index `start_index + 1` to `end_index - 1`) with the integer 0.
  - preserve_others: Elements originally being 0, and elements within blocks of length 1 or 2, remain unchanged.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Receive the input data, which represents a sequence of integers. Assume it might be provided as a 2D NumPy array with shape (1, N). If it is 2D, extract the first row to obtain a 1D sequence of N integers. Let this 1D sequence be the `working_sequence`.
2.  Create a copy of the `working_sequence` to serve as the `output_sequence`.
3.  Initialize an empty list to store identified `blocks`.
4.  Iterate through the `working_sequence` using an index `i` from 0 to N-1:
    a.  Keep track of the start index (`start_index`) and value (`current_value`) of the current potential block being scanned. Initialize `start_index` to `None`.
    b.  If the element `working_sequence[i]` is non-zero:
        i.  If `start_index` is `None`, it means a new block starts here. Set `start_index = i` and `current_value = working_sequence[i]`.
        ii. If `start_index` is not `None` but `working_sequence[i]` is different from `current_value`, it means the previous block ended at `i-1` and a new block starts at `i`. Record the previous block (value=`current_value`, start=`start_index`, end=`i-1`) in the `blocks` list. Then, update `start_index = i` and `current_value = working_sequence[i]`.
    c.  If the element `working_sequence[i]` is zero:
        i.  If `start_index` is not `None`, it means the block currently being tracked ends at `i-1`. Record this block (value=`current_value`, start=`start_index`, end=`i-1`) in the `blocks` list. Reset `start_index` to `None`.
5.  After the loop, if `start_index` is not `None`, it means a block extends to the very end of the sequence. Record this final block (value=`current_value`, start=`start_index`, end=`N-1`) in the `blocks` list.
6.  Iterate through each `block` (represented by its value, `start_index`, `end_index`) recorded in the `blocks` list:
    a.  Calculate the `block_length = end_index - start_index + 1`.
    b.  If `block_length > 2`:
        i.  Iterate through the indices `j` from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
        ii. Set the element in the `output_sequence` at index `j` to 0.
7.  Return the `output_sequence`.
