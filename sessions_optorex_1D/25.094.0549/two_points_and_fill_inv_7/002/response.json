            "text": "## General Assessment and Strategy\n\nThe execution results indicate a consistent error across all training and test examples: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function, and specifically the helper `find_blocks`, is receiving input data as NumPy arrays rather than standard Python lists, which was the implicit assumption during the initial code generation.\n\nThe error occurs when a NumPy array with multiple elements is used in a context that expects a single boolean value (e.g., `if my_array:`). Code analysis pinpointed the specific location: the `if not sequence:` check at the beginning of the `find_blocks` function. This check is incompatible with non-empty NumPy arrays.\n\nThe core logic of identifying blocks and modifying them based on length appears correct according to a manual walkthrough of the examples. The strategy is therefore:\n\n1.  Modify the initial check in `find_blocks` to be compatible with both lists and NumPy arrays (e.g., `if len(sequence) == 0:`).\n2.  Ensure all other operations (element access, comparison, assignment) are compatible with NumPy arrays. The analysis suggests they already are, as element-wise access yields NumPy scalar types which compare correctly with integers.\n3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and Natural Language Program) to explicitly mention NumPy arrays as the input type.\n\n## Metrics and Analysis\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** All examples are processed as NumPy arrays.\n*   **Error Consistency:** The *exact same* `ValueError` occurred for *all* 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the prompt context.\n*   **Error Source:** The error originates from the boolean evaluation of a non-empty NumPy array in the `if not sequence:` line within the `find_blocks` function.\n*   **Core Logic Validity:** Manual tracing of the algorithm (identifying blocks, zeroing out the middle of blocks > length 2) against the examples confirms the underlying transformation logic is correct. The issue is purely an implementation detail related to data type handling.\n*   **Example Breakdown (Post-Fix Logic Check):**\n    *   Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 involve blocks of length > 2, requiring modification. The expected outputs show the middle elements correctly zeroed out.\n    *   Example 7 involves a block of length 2. The logic correctly identifies `block_length > 2` as false, leading to no modification, matching the expected output.\n\nNo further code execution is needed for metrics at this stage, as the error source and the validity of the core logic are clear.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
