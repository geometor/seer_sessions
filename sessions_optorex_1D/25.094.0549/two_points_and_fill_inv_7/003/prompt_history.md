*   **Perception of Task Elements:**
    *   The input and output are sequences (lists) of single-digit integers.
    *   The sequences have a fixed length (12 in all examples).
    *   The core elements within the sequences are contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers.
    *   Zeros act as separators or padding around these blocks.
    *   The transformation modifies these blocks of non-zero numbers, while leaving the original zeros unchanged.
    *   Specifically, within each block of identical non-zero numbers, only the first and the last occurrence are preserved in their original positions in the output sequence. All other numbers within that block (the ones between the first and last) are changed to zero.
    *   If a block consists of only one or two numbers, all numbers in that block are preserved as there are no numbers *between* the first and last.

*   **YAML Facts:**
    
```yaml
    task_type: sequence_transformation
    input_element_type: integer
    output_element_type: integer
    sequence_length: fixed (12 in examples)
    objects:
      - sequence: a list of integers.
      - block: a contiguous sub-sequence of identical non-zero integers within the main sequence.
      - zero: the integer 0, often acting as a boundary or filler.
    properties:
      - block:
          - value: the non-zero integer comprising the block.
          - start_index: the index of the first element of the block.
          - end_index: the index of the last element of the block.
          - length: the number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
    relationships:
      - Blocks are separated by zeros or sequence boundaries.
      - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence.
    actions:
      - identify_blocks: Find all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers in the input sequence.
      - preserve_boundaries: For each identified block, keep the number at the start_index and the number at the end_index in the output sequence.
      - zero_out_middle: For each identified block with length > 2, change the elements between the start_index and end_index to zero in the output sequence.
      - preserve_zeros: Keep all original zeros from the input sequence in the output sequence.
    ```


*   **Natural Language Program:**
    1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
    2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers. Keep track of the start index, end index, and value for each block.
    3.  For each identified block:
        a.  If the block length is greater than 2 (i.e., the end index is more than one position after the start index):
            i.  Iterate from the index immediately after the start index up to (but not including) the end index.
            ii. Set the value at each of these intermediate indices in the *output* sequence to 0.
    4.  Return the modified output sequence. (Note: Zeros and blocks of length 1 or 2 are implicitly handled correctly by initializing the output as a copy and only modifying the middle of blocks longer than 2).

## General Assessment and Strategy

The execution results indicate a consistent error across all training and test examples: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly suggests that the `transform` function, and specifically the helper `find_blocks`, is receiving input data as NumPy arrays rather than standard Python lists, which was the implicit assumption during the initial code generation.

The error occurs when a NumPy array with multiple elements is used in a context that expects a single boolean value (e.g., `if my_array:`). Code analysis pinpointed the specific location: the `if not sequence:` check at the beginning of the `find_blocks` function. This check is incompatible with non-empty NumPy arrays.

The core logic of identifying blocks and modifying them based on length appears correct according to a manual walkthrough of the examples. The strategy is therefore:

1.  Modify the initial check in `find_blocks` to be compatible with both lists and NumPy arrays (e.g., `if len(sequence) == 0:`).
2.  Ensure all other operations (element access, comparison, assignment) are compatible with NumPy arrays. The analysis suggests they already are, as element-wise access yields NumPy scalar types which compare correctly with integers.
3.  Update the documentation (YAML facts and Natural Language Program) to explicitly mention NumPy arrays as the input type.

## Metrics and Analysis

*   **Input Data Type:** All examples are processed as NumPy arrays.
*   **Error Consistency:** The *exact same* `ValueError` occurred for *all* 7 training examples and the 1 test example provided in the prompt context.
*   **Error Source:** The error originates from the boolean evaluation of a non-empty NumPy array in the `if not sequence:` line within the `find_blocks` function.
*   **Core Logic Validity:** Manual tracing of the algorithm (identifying blocks, zeroing out the middle of blocks > length 2) against the examples confirms the underlying transformation logic is correct. The issue is purely an implementation detail related to data type handling.
*   **Example Breakdown (Post-Fix Logic Check):**
    *   Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 involve blocks of length > 2, requiring modification. The expected outputs show the middle elements correctly zeroed out.
    *   Example 7 involves a block of length 2. The logic correctly identifies `block_length > 2` as false, leading to no modification, matching the expected output.

No further code execution is needed for metrics at this stage, as the error source and the validity of the core logic are clear.

## YAML Facts


```yaml
task_type: sequence_transformation
input_data_format: NumPy array (1D)
output_data_format: NumPy array or list (consistent with input/framework)
input_element_type: integer
output_element_type: integer
sequence_length: fixed (12 in examples)
objects:
  - sequence: A 1D NumPy array of integers representing the input or output state.
  - block: A contiguous sub-sequence within the array consisting of identical non-zero integers.
  - zero: The integer 0, acting as a boundary between blocks or padding.
properties:
  - block:
      - value: The non-zero integer comprising the block.
      - start_index: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the sequence.
      - end_index: The 0-based index of the last element of the block in the sequence.
      - length: The number of elements in the block (calculated as end_index - start_index + 1).
relationships:
  - Blocks are contiguous sequences of the same non-zero value.
  - Blocks are delimited by zeros or the boundaries of the sequence.
  - The output sequence structure (length, positions of original zeros) mirrors the input, except for modifications within blocks.
actions:
  - input_validation: Check if the input sequence is empty using a method compatible with NumPy arrays (e.g., checking `len`).
  - copy_input: Create a modifiable copy of the input sequence to initialize the output sequence.
  - identify_blocks: Scan the sequence to find all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers, recording their value, start index, and end index.
  - filter_blocks: Select blocks based on their properties (specifically, length > 2).
  - modify_block_middle: For selected blocks (length > 2), iterate through the indices strictly between the start and end index and set the corresponding elements in the output sequence to 0.
  - preserve_elements: Elements not part of the middle section of a block longer than 2 (i.e., original zeros, elements of blocks with length 1 or 2, and the first/last elements of blocks longer than 2) remain unchanged from the initial copied input.
```


## Natural Language Program

1.  Accept the input sequence, which is a 1D NumPy array of integers.
2.  Create a deep copy of the input NumPy array; this copy will become the output sequence.
3.  Check if the input sequence has a length of 0. If it does, return the empty output sequence.
4.  Initialize an empty list to store identified blocks.
5.  Iterate through the input sequence using an index `i` and value `value`:
    a.  Keep track of the start index (`start_index`) and value (`current_value`) of the current potential block being scanned.
    b.  If `value` is non-zero:
        i.  If `start_index` is currently `None`, it means a new block starts here. Set `start_index` to `i` and `current_value` to `value`.
        ii. If `start_index` is not `None` but `value` is different from `current_value`, it signifies the end of the previous block and the start of a new one. Record the previous block (using `current_value`, `start_index`, and `i-1` as the end index) and then update `start_index` to `i` and `current_value` to `value`.
    c.  If `value` is zero and `start_index` is not `None`, it signifies the end of the current block. Record the block (using `current_value`, `start_index`, and `i-1` as the end index) and reset `start_index` to `None`.
6.  After the loop, if `start_index` is not `None`, it means a block extended to the very end of the sequence. Record this final block (using `current_value`, `start_index`, and the last index of the sequence as the end index).
7.  Iterate through the list of recorded blocks. For each block (represented by its value, start index, and end index):
    a.  Calculate the block's length: `length = end_index - start_index + 1`.
    b.  If `length` is greater than 2:
        i.  Iterate through the indices `j` from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
        ii. Set the element in the *output* sequence at index `j` to 0.
8.  Return the modified output sequence.
