"""
Transforms a 1D sequence represented within a (1, N) NumPy array. 
It identifies contiguous runs of identical non-zero digits. If a run's 
length exceeds 2, its interior elements (all except the first and last) 
are replaced with 0. Runs of length 1 or 2, and original zero elements, 
remain unchanged. The output maintains the (1, N) shape.
