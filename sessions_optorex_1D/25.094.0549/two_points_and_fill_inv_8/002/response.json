            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` across all examples strongly indicates that the `transform` function was operating on NumPy arrays, and specifically that a conditional check (like `if condition:`) was receiving a boolean NumPy array resulting from an element-wise comparison, rather than a single boolean value. This typically happens if the input variable (`input_sequence` in this case) is treated as a scalar or expected to yield a scalar upon indexing/comparison, but instead represents an array (e.g., comparing a whole array `input_sequence == 0` or accessing an element that yields an array, like a row from a 2D array).\n\nGiven that the task involves processing sequences (which are 1D), the most likely scenario is that the input data is being loaded or passed into the function as a 2D NumPy array with a single row (e.g., shape `(1, N)`) instead of a 1D array (shape `(N,)`) or a Python list. The original code likely attempted comparisons on this 2D structure inappropriately.\n\nThe core logic identified previously (identifying runs of identical non-zero digits and replacing the interior of runs longer than 2 with zeros) appears consistent with all provided input/output pairs. The strategy is to adapt the implementation to correctly handle the assumed 2D NumPy array input format by explicitly accessing the first row (which contains the 1D sequence data) and applying the transformation logic to that row.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input/Output Format:** Based on the error, inputs are inferred to be 2D NumPy arrays of shape `(1, N)`, where `N` is the length of the sequence (12 in all training examples). Outputs should likely match this shape.\n*   **Data Type:** Elements are integers.\n*   **Core Transformation Rule:** The rule holds for all examples:\n    *   `train_1`: `[1, 1, 1]` (len 3) -> `[1, 0, 1]`\n    *   `train_2`: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (len 7) -> `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`\n    *   `train_3`: `[6, 6]` (len 2) -> `[6, 6]` (unchanged as length <= 2)\n    *   `train_4`: `[4, 4, 4, 4]` (len 4) -> `[4, 0, 0, 4]`\n    *   `train_5`: `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` (len 11) -> `[4, 0, ..., 0, 4]`\n    *   `train_6`: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (len 6) -> `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`\n    *   `train_7`: `[7, 7, 7]` (len 3) -> `[7, 0, 7]`\n*   **Zero Handling:** Zeros act as delimiters and are preserved unless they replace the interior of a modified run.\n*   **Run Definition:** A run consists of contiguous, *identical*, *non-zero* digits.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
