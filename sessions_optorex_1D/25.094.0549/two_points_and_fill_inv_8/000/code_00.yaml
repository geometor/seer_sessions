task_description: Modifying interior elements of contiguous non-zero runs in a sequence.
elements:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers (0-9)
    role: input and output structure
  - name: non_zero_run
    type: contiguous sub-sequence
    properties:
      - all elements are the same non-zero digit
      - bounded by zeros or sequence ends
    role: primary object of transformation
  - name: zero_element
    type: integer
    value: 0
    role: delimiter, generally preserved
  - name: run_length
    type: integer
    role: property determining the action on a non_zero_run
actions:
  - name: identify_runs
    input: input_sequence
    output: list of non_zero_runs (with start/end indices and value)
  - name: modify_run
    input: non_zero_run
    condition: run_length > 2
    effect: change all elements except the first and last to 0
  - name: preserve_run
    input: non_zero_run
    condition: run_length <= 2
    effect: keep the run unchanged
  - name: preserve_zeros
    input: zero_elements in input_sequence
    effect: keep zero elements unchanged in the output sequence
relationships:
  - input sequence length equals output sequence length
  - transformation is applied independently to each non_zero_run
  - output sequence is constructed by applying modifications/preservations to runs and preserving original zeros
