            "text": "Okay, let's analyze the input-output pairs to understand the transformation.\n\n**Perception of Elements and Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both inputs and outputs are sequences (lists or arrays) of single-digit integers. The length of the output sequence is always the same as the length of the input sequence.\n2.  **Key Element:** The core transformation seems to operate on contiguous blocks (runs) of identical non-zero numbers.\n3.  **Role of Zeros:** Zeroes (`0`) appear to act as delimiters or background elements. They generally remain unchanged unless they are part of the transformation applied to a non-zero block. However, based on the examples, the transformation specifically targets the *interior* of non-zero blocks, leaving the surrounding zeros untouched.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   Identify contiguous runs of the *same* non-zero digit. Let's call the digit `d` (where `d > 0`) and the length of the run `L`.\n    *   If `L` is 1 or 2, the run remains unchanged in the output. (See train\\_3: `[6, 6]` -> `[6, 6]`).\n    *   If `L` is greater than 2, the first and last elements of the run remain `d`, but all elements *between* the first and the last are changed to `0`. (See train\\_1: `[1, 1, 1]` -> `[1, 0, 1]`; train\\_4: `[4, 4, 4, 4]` -> `[4, 0, 0, 4]`; train\\_2: `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` -> `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`).\n5.  **Multiple Runs:** The transformation applies independently to each distinct run of non-zero digits within the sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
