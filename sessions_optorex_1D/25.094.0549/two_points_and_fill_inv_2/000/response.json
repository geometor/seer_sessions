Zeros act as delimiters or background elements.\n- **Transformation:** The core transformation operates on these non-zero blocks. Within each block, only the first and the last digit are preserved in the output. All the digits *between* the first and the last digit of the block are replaced with '0'. Digits that are initially '0' remain '0'. Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged as there are no elements strictly *between* the first and last.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
