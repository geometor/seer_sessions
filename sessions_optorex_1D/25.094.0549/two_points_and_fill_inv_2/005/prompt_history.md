## Perception of Elements

The task involves transforming a sequence of single digits based on contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
- **Input:** A sequence of single-digit integers.
- **Output:** A sequence of single-digit integers of the same length as the input.
- **Key Elements:** Contiguous blocks (runs) of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence. Zeros act as delimiters or background elements.
- **Transformation:** The core transformation operates on these non-zero blocks. Within each block, only the first and the last digit are preserved in the output. All the digits *between* the first and the last digit of the block are replaced with '0'. Digits that are initially '0' remain '0'. Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged as there are no elements strictly *between* the first and last.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Initialize** the output sequence as a direct copy of the input sequence.
2.  **Iterate** through the input sequence from left to right to identify contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits. Keep track of the start index, end index, and the value of each block found.
3.  **For each identified block** where the length (end index - start index + 1) is greater than 2:
    a.  Iterate through the indices starting from `start_index + 1` up to, but not including, `end_index`.
    b.  For each of these intermediate indices, set the value in the **output sequence** at that index to `0`.
4.  **Return** the modified output sequence.

## General Assessment

The core transformation logic identified previously—preserving the first and last elements of contiguous non-zero blocks and replacing intermediate elements with zero—appears consistent across all provided training examples. The execution error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous...") strongly suggests that the input data format was not a standard Python list of integers as assumed by the previous code, but likely a NumPy array or a similar structure where element-wise comparison is required. Alternatively, the comparison logic within the code might have been flawed when dealing with the specific data type provided by the execution environment.

The strategy is to:
1.  Explicitly define the input format as a space-separated string of digits.
2.  Incorporate parsing this string into a list of integers as the first step.
3.  Verify the transformation logic against all examples using this parsed list format.
4.  Refine the natural language program and YAML facts to accurately reflect the parsing step and the transformation rule confirmed across all examples.

```
**Findings:**

*   **Input/Output Format:** The inputs and outputs are consistently space-separated strings of digits.
*   **Length:** Input and output sequences always have the same length (12 in all training examples).
*   **Transformation Logic:** The simulation confirms that the logic (identify non-zero blocks, if length > 2, zero out elements between the first and last) correctly predicts the output for *all* provided training examples.
*   **Conclusion:** The original natural language program described the correct logic, but the implementation failed likely due to not handling the input string parsing correctly or encountering an unexpected data type (like NumPy arrays) in the execution environment.

## Natural Language Program

1.  **Parse** the input string (space-separated digits) into a list of integers (the `parsed_sequence`).
2.  **Initialize** a `modified_sequence` as a direct copy of the `parsed_sequence`.
3.  **Iterate** through the `parsed_sequence` using an index `i` from left to right.
4.  **If** the digit at index `i` in `parsed_sequence` is `0`, continue to the next index (`i + 1`).
5.  **If** the digit is non-zero:
    a.  Record the `start_index` (`i`) and the `block_value` (the digit at `parsed_sequence[i]`).
    b.  Find the `end_index` of the contiguous block of this `block_value` by looking ahead from `i + 1`.
    c.  Calculate the `block_length` (`end_index - start_index + 1`).
    d.  **If** `block_length` is greater than 2:
        i.  Iterate through the indices `k` from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
        ii. Set the element at index `k` in the `modified_sequence` to `0`.
    e.  Advance the main iteration index `i` to `end_index + 1` to continue scanning after the current block.
6.  **After** iterating through the entire `parsed_sequence`, **format** the `modified_sequence` back into a space-separated string.
7.  **Return** the resulting string.
