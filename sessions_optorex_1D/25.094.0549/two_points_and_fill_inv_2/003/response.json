Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.\n2.  Iterate through the input sequence element by element using an index.\n3.  If the current element is `0`, continue to the next element.\n4.  If the current element is non-zero, identify this as the start of a potential block. Record its value and start index.\n5.  Look ahead from the current position to find the end index of the contiguous block of the *same* non-zero digit.\n6.  Calculate the length of this identified block.\n7.  If the block length is greater than 2:\n    a.  Iterate through the indices within the output sequence, starting from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.\n    b.  Set the element at each of these intermediate indices in the **output sequence** to `0`.\n8.  Advance the main iteration index to the position immediately after the identified block (i.e., `end_index + 1`) to avoid reprocessing elements within the block.\n9.
