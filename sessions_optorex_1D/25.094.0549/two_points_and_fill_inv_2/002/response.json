            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe initial analysis identified the core transformation rule: locate contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits and replace the inner elements of blocks longer than two with zeros, preserving the first and last elements of the block and all original zeros. This logic holds true across all provided training examples.\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" consistently appears for all examples during testing. This strongly suggests an issue with how the input data is being handled or compared within the testing environment, likely involving NumPy arrays where standard Python boolean logic for sequences (like `if sequence:`) or element-wise comparison is expected but not correctly applied. The error does *not* indicate a flaw in the perceived transformation logic itself, but rather an incompatibility between the provided code's assumptions (standard Python lists and direct boolean evaluation) and the testing framework's data types or comparison methods.\n\nThe strategy is to maintain the current understanding of the transformation rule, as it aligns perfectly with all input/output pairs, and acknowledge that the implementation needs adjustment to handle the specific data types or comparison requirements of the execution environment. The natural language program and YAML facts, which describe the *logic*, remain accurate.\n\n## Metrics and Verification\n\nThe transformation rule can be consistently applied:\n*   Identify contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers.\n*   If a block's length is 3 or more, keep the first and last numbers of the block and change the numbers in between to 0.\n*   Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged.\n*   Zeros in the input remain zeros in the output.\n\nLet's re-verify with the provided code's logic using Python lists, assuming the inputs are correctly parsed as lists of integers:\n"
