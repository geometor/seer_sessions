"""
Transforms a sequence of single-digit integers based on contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence element by element using an index.
3.  If the current element is `0`, continue to the next element.
4.  If the current element is non-zero, identify this as the start of a potential block. Record its value and start index.
5.  Look ahead from the current position to find the end index of the contiguous block of the *same* non-zero digit.
6.  Calculate the length of this identified block.
7.  If the block length is greater than 2:
    a.  Iterate through the indices within the output sequence, starting from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index`.
    b.  Set the element at each of these intermediate indices in the **output sequence** to `0`.
8.  Advance the main iteration index to the position immediately after the identified block (i.e., `end_index + 1`) to avoid reprocessing elements within the block.
9.  Continue iterating until the end of the input sequence is reached.
10. Return the modified output sequence.
