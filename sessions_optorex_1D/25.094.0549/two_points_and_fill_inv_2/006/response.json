            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe previous execution failed across all examples with the error `AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`. This clearly indicates that the `transform` function was designed to accept a space-separated string (`input_str`) and attempted to use string methods (`strip()`, `split()`) on it. However, the testing environment passed the input as a NumPy array (`numpy.ndarray`).\n\nThe core transformation logic (identifying contiguous blocks of non-zero identical digits and zeroing out the intermediate elements if the block length is greater than 2) appears consistent with the initial examples. The failure occurred solely due to the incorrect assumption about the input data type and the corresponding parsing/formatting steps.\n\n**Strategy for Resolution:**\n\n1.  Modify the `transform` function to accept a NumPy array directly as input.\n2.  Remove the string parsing (`parse_input_string`) and formatting (`format_output_sequence`) steps.\n3.  Adapt the sequence manipulation logic to work with NumPy arrays. This might involve using array indexing and potentially creating a copy of the input array to modify, ensuring the original input is not altered unexpectedly. Iteration and indexing logic should translate relatively easily from lists to 1D NumPy arrays.\n\n## Metrics\n\nThe provided error message (`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'strip'`) consistently occurred for all 7 training examples and the 1 test example.\n\n*   **Input Type:** Confirmed to be `numpy.ndarray` for all examples.\n*   **Error Stage:** Input processing/parsing. The core transformation logic was never reached due to the type mismatch.\n*   **Output Comparison:** Not possible as the function failed before producing any output.\n\nNo code execution is needed to gather further metrics, as the error message itself provides the crucial information about the input type discrepancy.\n\n## YAML Facts\n\n"
