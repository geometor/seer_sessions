            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern: identifying contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers and modifying them based on length. The provided examples consistently show that blocks with a length greater than 2 are \"hollowed out,\" meaning only the first and last elements of the block remain, while the interior elements are set to 0. Blocks of length 1 or 2, as well as sequences of zeros, remain unchanged.\n\nThe Python code developed previously aimed to implement this logic using `itertools.groupby`. The reported execution error (\"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous\") across all examples is puzzling, especially since the code appears logically sound for standard Python lists and the transformation rule seems consistent. This error typically arises when using NumPy arrays in boolean contexts expecting a single True/False value. It suggests a discrepancy between the assumed input type (`list[int]`) and the actual data type passed during execution (possibly a NumPy array), or an issue within the testing harness itself.\n\nDespite the execution error, the underlying transformation rule derived from the visual inspection of the input/output pairs appears correct and consistent. The strategy is to refine the description of this rule (YAML facts and natural language program) based on the complete set of examples, assuming the rule itself is valid, even if the previous code implementation failed in the specific test environment.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\nLet's analyze each example against the \"hollow out blocks > 2\" rule:\n\n*   **train_1:** `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block: `4 4` (length 2). Rule: Keep unchanged. Output matches.\n*   **train_2:** `[0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block: `6 6 6 6 6 6 6` (length 7). Rule: Hollow out (keep first and last 6, zeros in between). Output matches.\n*   **train_3:** `[0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0]` -> `[0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0]`\n    *   Block: `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7` (length 9). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.\n*   **train_4:** `[0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block: `5 5 5 5 5` (length 5). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.\n*   **train_5:** `[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` -> `[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]`\n    *   Block: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (length 12). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.\n*   **train_6:** `[0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` -> `[0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]`\n    *   Block: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (length 11). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.\n*   **train_7:** `[0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0]`\n    *   Block: `3 3 3 3` (length 4). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.\n\nThe rule holds perfectly for all training examples provided. The execution errors reported earlier seem unrelated to the correctness of the transformation logic itself derived from the examples.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
