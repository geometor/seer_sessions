objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: Represents both the input and output data structures. Contains single-digit integers.
  - name: block
    type: contiguous subsequence
    description: A run of identical consecutive elements within the input sequence.
properties:
  - object: sequence
    name: elements
    type: list of integers
    description: The ordered integers comprising the sequence.
  - object: block
    name: value
    type: integer
    description: The integer value repeated in the block.
  - object: block
    name: start_index
    type: integer
    description: The 0-based index of the first element of the block in the original sequence.
  - object: block
    name: end_index
    type: integer
    description: The 0-based index of the last element of the block in the original sequence.
  - object: block
    name: length
    type: integer
    description: The number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
conditions:
  - name: is_non_zero_block
    description: Checks if the block's value is not 0.
  - name: is_long_block
    description: Checks if the block's length is greater than 2.
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of identical elements.
  - name: hollow_out_block
    description: Modify a block in the output sequence by setting its interior elements (all except the first and last) to zero. This action is conditional.
relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence by selectively applying the hollow_out_block action.
  - The hollow_out_block action is applied to a block if and only if the is_non_zero_block condition AND the is_long_block condition are both true for that block.
  - Blocks that do not meet both conditions remain unchanged in the output sequence relative to the input sequence.
  - Zero blocks are never hollowed out.
  - Non-zero blocks of length 1 or 2 are never hollowed out.
