The core operation focuses on identifying contiguous blocks (or subsequences) of identical non-zero numbers within the input sequence. The transformation rule depends on the length of these blocks. Zeros in the input sequence generally remain unchanged unless they are part of the modification applied to a non-zero block. The output sequence always has the same length as the input sequence.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
