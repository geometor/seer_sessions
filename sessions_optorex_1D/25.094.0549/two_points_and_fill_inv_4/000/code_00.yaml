objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list of integers
    description: Represents both the input and output data structures.
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: subsequence
    description: A contiguous run of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence.
properties:
  - object: sequence
    name: length
    type: integer
    description: The number of elements in the sequence.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: value
    type: integer
    description: The non-zero integer value repeated in the block.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: start_index
    type: integer
    description: The index of the first element of the block in the original sequence.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: end_index
    type: integer
    description: The index of the last element of the block in the original sequence.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: block_length
    type: integer
    description: The number of elements in the block (calculated as end_index - start_index + 1).
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all non_zero_blocks.
  - name: hollow_out_block
    description: Modify a block in the output sequence by setting its interior elements (all except the first and last) to zero.
relationships:
  - The output sequence is generated from the input sequence.
  - The transformation is applied based on the properties (specifically block_length) of identified non_zero_blocks.
  - If a non_zero_block has a block_length greater than 2, the hollow_out_block action is applied to the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
  - If a non_zero_block has a block_length of 1 or 2, it remains unchanged in the output sequence.
  - Elements originally zero remain zero unless they fall within the indices being modified by the hollow_out_block action.
