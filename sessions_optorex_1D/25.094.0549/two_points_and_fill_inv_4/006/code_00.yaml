objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: 1D list or 1xN NumPy array of integers
    description: Represents both the input and output data structures. Appears as a single row.
  - name: non_zero_block
    type: contiguous subsequence
    description: A run of identical non-zero integers within the input sequence.
  - name: zero_block
    type: contiguous subsequence
    description: A run of zeros within the input sequence.
properties:
  - object: sequence
    name: length
    type: integer
    description: The number of elements in the sequence.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: value
    type: integer
    description: The non-zero integer value repeated in the block.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: start_index
    type: integer
    description: The 0-based index of the first element of the block.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: end_index
    type: integer
    description: The 0-based index of the last element of the block.
  - object: non_zero_block
    name: block_length
    type: integer
    description: The number of elements in the block (end_index - start_index + 1).
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks (both zero and non-zero).
  - name: hollow_out_block
    description: Modify a non_zero_block in the output sequence by setting its interior elements (all elements except the first and last) to zero. This action is conditional.
relationships:
  - The output sequence is derived from the input sequence, preserving its length.
  - The transformation specifically targets non_zero_blocks based on their block_length.
  - If a non_zero_block has block_length > 2, the hollow_out_block action is applied to the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
  - If a non_zero_block has block_length <= 2, it remains unchanged in the output sequence.
  - zero_blocks remain unchanged in the output sequence.
  - The transformation preserves the first and last elements of any modified non_zero_block.
