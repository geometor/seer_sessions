Identifies contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers in the input sequence. 
If a block's length is greater than 2, it 'hollows out' the block in the output sequence 
by setting all elements except the first and last to zero. Blocks of length 1 or 2, 
and sequences of zeros, remain unchanged.
