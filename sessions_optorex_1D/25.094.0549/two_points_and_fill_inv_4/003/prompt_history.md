**Perception of Task Elements:**

The task involves processing a sequence of single-digit integers. The core operation focuses on identifying contiguous blocks (or subsequences) of identical non-zero numbers within the input sequence. The transformation rule depends on the length of these blocks. Zeros in the input sequence generally remain unchanged unless they are part of the modification applied to a non-zero block. The output sequence always has the same length as the input sequence.

**YAML Facts:**

relationships:
  - The output sequence is generated from the input sequence.
  - The transformation is applied based on the properties (specifically block_length) of identified non_zero_blocks.
  - If a non_zero_block has a block_length greater than 2, the hollow_out_block action is applied to the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
  - If a non_zero_block has a block_length of 1 or 2, it remains unchanged in the output sequence.
  - Elements originally zero remain zero unless they fall within the indices being modified by the hollow_out_block action.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input sequence.
2.  Create a mutable copy of the input sequence; this will become the output sequence.
3.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous subsequences (blocks) consisting of the same non-zero number. Keep track of the start index, end index, and the non-zero value for each block.
4.  For each identified non-zero block:
    a.  Calculate the length of the block.
    b.  If the length of the block is greater than 2:
        i.  In the output sequence, iterate from the index immediately *after* the block's start index up to the index *before* the block's end index.
        ii. Set the value of each element at these indices to 0.
5.  Return the modified output sequence.

**General Assessment:**

The initial analysis correctly identified the core pattern: identifying contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers and modifying them based on length. The provided examples consistently show that blocks with a length greater than 2 are "hollowed out," meaning only the first and last elements of the block remain, while the interior elements are set to 0. Blocks of length 1 or 2, as well as sequences of zeros, remain unchanged.

The Python code developed previously aimed to implement this logic using `itertools.groupby`. The reported execution error ("The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous") across all examples is puzzling, especially since the code appears logically sound for standard Python lists and the transformation rule seems consistent. This error typically arises when using NumPy arrays in boolean contexts expecting a single True/False value. It suggests a discrepancy between the assumed input type (`list[int]`) and the actual data type passed during execution (possibly a NumPy array), or an issue within the testing harness itself.

Despite the execution error, the underlying transformation rule derived from the visual inspection of the input/output pairs appears correct and consistent. The strategy is to refine the description of this rule (YAML facts and natural language program) based on the complete set of examples, assuming the rule itself is valid, even if the previous code implementation failed in the specific test environment.

**Metrics and Analysis:**

Let's analyze each example against the "hollow out blocks > 2" rule:

*   **train_1:** `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Block: `4 4` (length 2). Rule: Keep unchanged. Output matches.
*   **train_2:** `[0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Block: `6 6 6 6 6 6 6` (length 7). Rule: Hollow out (keep first and last 6, zeros in between). Output matches.
*   **train_3:** `[0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0]` -> `[0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0]`
    *   Block: `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7` (length 9). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.
*   **train_4:** `[0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Block: `5 5 5 5 5` (length 5). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.
*   **train_5:** `[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` -> `[1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]`
    *   Block: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (length 12). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.
*   **train_6:** `[0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]` -> `[0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]`
    *   Block: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1` (length 11). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.
*   **train_7:** `[0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0]` -> `[0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0]`
    *   Block: `3 3 3 3` (length 4). Rule: Hollow out. Output matches.

The rule holds perfectly for all training examples provided. The execution errors reported earlier seem unrelated to the correctness of the transformation logic itself derived from the examples.

  - If a contiguous_block has a value of 0, it is preserved in the output.
  - If a contiguous_block has a non-zero value and its block_length is 1 or 2, it is preserved in the output.
  - If a contiguous_block has a non-zero value and its block_length is greater than 2, the hollow_out_block action is applied to the corresponding positions in the output sequence.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Initialize an output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence, identifying contiguous blocks of identical numbers. For each block, record its value, start index, and end index.
3.  For each identified block:
    a.  Check if the block's value is non-zero.
    b.  If the value is non-zero, calculate the block's length (end index - start index + 1).
    c.  If the block's length is greater than 2:
        i.  Iterate through the indices of the output sequence from `start index + 1` up to, but not including, `end index`.
        ii. Set the element at each of these interior indices to 0.
    d.  (Implicit) If the block's value is zero, or if its value is non-zero but its length is 1 or 2, no changes are made to the corresponding elements in the output sequence (they retain their original values from the initial copy).
4.  Return the modified output sequence.
