task_description: Modify a sequence of digits by zeroing out elements between the first and last non-zero elements.
input_data:
  type: string
  format: space-separated single digits (0-9)
  elements: sequence of numbers
  length: 12 (observed in examples, confirmed by metrics)
output_data:
  type: string
  format: space-separated single digits (0-9)
  elements: sequence of numbers, modified from input
  length: 12 (same as input)
objects:
  - sequence: The list or array of digits representing the input or output state.
  - digit: An individual numerical element within the sequence.
  - non_zero_digit: A digit with a value > 0.
  - boundary_digits: The first and last non-zero digits in the sequence.
  - inner_digits: Digits located strictly between the first and last non-zero digits.
  - outer_digits: Digits located before the first non-zero digit or after the last non-zero digit (includes leading/trailing zeros).
properties:
  - index: The zero-based position of a digit within the sequence.
  - value: The numerical value of a digit (0-9).
  - first_non_zero_index: The smallest index containing a non_zero_digit. None if all digits are zero.
  - last_non_zero_index: The largest index containing a non_zero_digit. None if all digits are zero.
actions:
  - parse: Convert the input string into a numerical sequence (e.g., list or array).
  - find_boundaries: Determine the indices of the first and last non-zero digits.
  - preserve: Maintain the original value and position of digits that are not 'inner_digits'. This includes leading zeros, trailing zeros, and the boundary_digits themselves.
  - replace_with_zero: Change the value of all 'inner_digits' to 0.
  - format_output: Convert the modified numerical sequence back into a space-separated string.
relationships:
  - span: The range of indices from the first_non_zero_index to the last_non_zero_index, inclusive.
  - between: Refers to indices `i` such that `first_non_zero_index < i < last_non_zero_index`. Digits at these indices are 'inner_digits'.
invariants:
  - Sequence length remains constant between input and output.
  - The values and positions of the boundary_digits remain unchanged.
  - The values and positions of outer_digits (leading/trailing zeros) remain unchanged.
special_cases:
  - If the sequence contains fewer than two non-zero digits (zero or one), no digits are 'inner_digits', and the output sequence is identical to the input sequence.
