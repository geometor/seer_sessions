task_description: Modifies a sequence of digits by zeroing out elements located strictly between the first and last non-zero elements found in the sequence.
input_data:
  type: sequence (represented as string or 1D array)
  format: space-separated single digits (0-9) in string form, or 1D numpy array of integers
  elements: integer digits (0-9)
  length: variable (observed as 12 in examples, but rule is general)
output_data:
  type: sequence (same format as input)
  elements: integer digits (0-9), modified from input
  length: same as input
objects:
  - sequence: The list or array of digits.
  - digit: Individual numerical element within the sequence.
  - non_zero_digit: A digit with a value > 0.
  - boundary_digits: The set containing the first non-zero digit and the last non-zero digit in the sequence.
  - inner_digits: The contiguous subsequence of digits located strictly between the first and last non-zero digits.
properties:
  - index: Position (0-based) of a digit within the sequence.
  - value: The numerical value of a digit (0-9).
  - first_non_zero_index: The lowest index containing a non_zero_digit. (Undefined if none exist)
  - last_non_zero_index: The highest index containing a non_zero_digit. (Undefined if none exist)
actions:
  - find_indices: Locate the indices of all non_zero_digits.
  - identify_boundaries: Determine the minimum (first) and maximum (last) index from the set of non_zero_digit indices.
  - preserve: Keep the original value of digits at indices less than first_non_zero_index, greater than last_non_zero_index, and exactly at first_non_zero_index and last_non_zero_index.
  - replace_with_zero: Change the value to 0 for all digits at indices strictly greater than first_non_zero_index and strictly less than last_non_zero_index.
relationships:
  - positional: The transformation depends entirely on the position (index) of non-zero digits.
  - betweenness: The core action targets digits based on their position relative to the boundary indices.
invariants:
  - Sequence length remains constant.
  - The values and positions of the first and last non-zero digits are preserved.
  - Digits outside the span [first_non_zero_index, last_non_zero_index] are preserved.
  - The relative order of preserved digits remains the same.
special_cases:
  - If the sequence contains fewer than two non-zero digits (zero or one), the sequence remains unchanged, as there are no "inner" digits to modify.
