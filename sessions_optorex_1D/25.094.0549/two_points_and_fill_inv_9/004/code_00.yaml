task_description: Modifies contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits within a 1D array or array-like structure.
elements:
  - type: array
    description: A 1D structure (potentially list or NumPy array) containing single-digit integers.
  - type: digit
    description: Integers from 0 to 9, representing values within the array.
  - type: sequence
    description: A contiguous run of identical non-zero digits within the array.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero digit making up the sequence.
      - length: The number of times the digit repeats consecutively.
      - start_index: The index of the first digit in the sequence.
      - end_index: The index of the last digit in the sequence.
objects:
  - identifier: input_array
    type: array
    description: The initial state before transformation, potentially a NumPy array.
  - identifier: output_array
    type: array
    description: The final state after transformation, should maintain the input type or be a standard list.
  - identifier: non_zero_sequence
    type: sequence
    description: A specific instance of a contiguous run of identical non-zero digits found in the input array.
relationships:
  - type: copy_modify
    description: The output array is initially based on the input array, with specific modifications applied.
  - type: comparison
    description: Individual elements of the array are compared against scalar values (e.g., checking if an element is non-zero) and against each other (checking for sequence continuation). These comparisons must handle potential array-like element types.
actions:
  - name: find_sequences
    description: Identify all contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits in the input array by iterating through elements and performing element-wise comparisons.
  - name: check_length
    description: Determine the length of each identified sequence.
  - name: modify_sequence
    description: If a sequence's length is 3 or more, replace its internal elements (all except the first and last) with 0 in the output array.
    condition: sequence length >= 3
    effect: Elements at indices from `start_index + 1` to `end_index - 1` are set to 0.
  - name: preserve_sequence
    description: If a sequence's length is less than 3, keep it unchanged in the output array.
    condition: sequence length < 3
    effect: No change to the sequence elements.
