            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe error message \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\" consistently appears across all examples. This strongly indicates that the input data provided to the `transform` function in the testing environment is not a standard Python list of integers, but rather a NumPy array or a similar array-like structure. The comparison `current_val != 0` fails because `current_val` itself is treated as an array (even if it contains a single element from the perspective of the overall structure), and comparing an array directly to a scalar (0) using standard boolean operators (`!=`, `==`, etc.) is ambiguous in NumPy.\n\nThe core logic identified previously\u2014finding contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits and modifying those with length 3 or more by zeroing out the internal elements\u2014appears consistent with all provided input/output pairs.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Input Type:** Explicitly state in the documentation (YAML, natural language program) that the input might be an array-like structure (like a NumPy array) and that operations must be compatible with this.\n2.  **Refine Comparison Logic:** The natural language program should emphasize element-wise comparison. The implementation (which will be handled by the coder) needs to ensure comparisons like checking if an element is non-zero are performed correctly for array elements.\n3.  **Maintain Core Transformation Rule:** The fundamental rule for transforming sequences based on length remains unchanged, as it aligns with all examples.\n4.  **Gather Metrics:** Re-analyze sequence lengths and transformations to confirm the rule's universality across the examples.\n\n**Metrics and Analysis:**\n\n| Example | Input                       | Sequence(s) Found | Sequence Length | Modification Rule | Expected Output             | Code Result | Analysis                                    |\n| :------ | :-------------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------ |\n| train_1 | `[... 0 2 2 0 ...]`       | `2 2`             | 2               | Length < 3        | `[... 0 2 2 0 ...]`       | Error       | Rule: Preserve.

Error due to type. |\n\nThe analysis confirms the transformation rule is consistent. The errors stem from how the code handles the *type* of the input data during comparison operations, not from incorrect logic about the transformation itself.\n\n**YAML Facts:**\n\n"
