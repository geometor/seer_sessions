task_description: Modifies a 2D grid of integers by altering horizontal sequences of identical non-zero digits within each row.
elements:
  - type: grid
    description: A 2D array (matrix) of single-digit integers, likely represented as a NumPy array.
    properties:
      - rows: Number of horizontal lines in the grid.
      - columns: Number of vertical lines in the grid.
      - dtype: Data type of elements (integers).
  - type: row
    description: A 1D horizontal array within the grid.
  - type: digit
    description: Integer value within a cell of the grid (0-9 observed).
  - type: horizontal_sequence
    description: A contiguous run of identical non-zero digits within a single row.
    properties:
      - value: The non-zero digit making up the sequence.
      - length: The number of times the digit repeats consecutively in the row.
      - row_index: The index of the row containing the sequence.
      - start_col: The starting column index of the sequence within the row.
      - end_col: The ending column index of the sequence within the row.
objects:
  - identifier: input_grid
    type: grid
    description: The initial state before transformation.
  - identifier: output_grid
    type: grid
    description: The final state after transformation, having the same dimensions as the input grid.
relationships:
  - type: row_correspondence
    description: Each row in the output grid corresponds to the processed version of the row at the same index in the input grid.
actions:
  - name: iterate_rows
    description: Process each row of the input grid independently.
  - name: find_horizontal_sequences
    description: Within a given row, identify all contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits.
  - name: check_sequence_length
    description: Determine the length of each identified horizontal sequence.
  - name: modify_long_sequence
    description: If a horizontal sequence's length is 3 or more, replace its internal elements (all except the first and last in the sequence) with 0 in the corresponding output row.
    condition: sequence length >= 3
    effect: Elements in the output row from `start_col + 1` to `end_col - 1` are set to 0.
  - name: preserve_short_sequence
    description: If a horizontal sequence's length is less than 3, keep it unchanged relative to the input row.
    condition: sequence length < 3
    effect: The sequence elements in the output row remain the same as in the input row.
  - name: copy_zeros
    description: Zero elements from the input row are copied directly to the output row.
