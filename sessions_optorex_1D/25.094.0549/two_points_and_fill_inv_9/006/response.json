            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe core issue stems from misinterpreting the input data structure. The initial analysis treated the input/output as 1-dimensional lists of integers. However, the error message `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` strongly indicates that the input data are NumPy arrays, likely 2D grids (matrices), and the failing code attempted boolean evaluation on entire arrays or slices rather than individual elements.\n\nThe transformation rule itself (modifying horizontal sequences of identical non-zero digits with length >= 3 by zeroing out internal elements) appears correct based on the examples, assuming it applies row-wise to a 2D grid.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Data Structure:** Treat the input as a 2D NumPy array (or a list of lists representing a grid).\n2.  **Row-wise Processing:** Iterate through each row of the input grid.\n3.  **Apply Sequence Logic:** For each row, apply the previously derived sequence identification and modification logic:\n    *   Scan the row for contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits.\n    *   Determine the length of each sequence.\n    *   If a sequence length is 3 or more, modify a *copy* of the row by setting the elements between the first and last elements of the sequence to 0.\n4.  **Construct Output:** Build the output grid using the modified rows.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nBased on the error and the structure of the examples, we assume the input is a NumPy array. Let's verify the properties and the source of the error using `tool_code`.\n\n"
