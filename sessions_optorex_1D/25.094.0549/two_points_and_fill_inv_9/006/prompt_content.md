"""
Modifies contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits within a 1D array or array-like structure.
If a contiguous sequence of an identical non-zero digit has a length of 3 or more, 
its internal elements (all except the first and last elements of the sequence) are replaced with 0. 
Sequences of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged. '0' digits act as separators and are not part of sequences.
