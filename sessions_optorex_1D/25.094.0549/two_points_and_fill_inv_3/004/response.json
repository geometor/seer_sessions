            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code failed during execution with the error: \"The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\". This strongly suggests that the `input_grid` variable, assumed to be a 1D NumPy array (or sequence) based on the initial examples, is actually being treated as or is in fact a 2D NumPy array (a grid) in the test environment. The comparison `if sequence[i] != 0:` in `find_groups_np` works for individual elements, but if `input_grid` itself (or a slice of it) were used in a boolean context elsewhere (e.g., `if input_grid:` or `if some_slice:`), this error would occur.\n\nThe transformation logic identified previously (finding contiguous horizontal blocks of identical non-zero numbers and \"hollowing out\" those longer than 2) appears correct based on the visual structure of the 1-row examples. However, the implementation needs to be adapted to handle 2D grids, likely by applying the transformation logic independently to each row.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the inputs are 2D NumPy arrays (grids).\n2.  **Adapt Logic:** Modify the approach to iterate through each row of the input grid.\n3.  **Apply Row Transformation:** Apply the existing `find_groups_np` and the hollowing logic to each individual row.\n4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 2D grid structure and row-wise operation.\n\n## Metrics Gathering\n\nSince we don't have the exact inputs that caused the error, we cannot run specific code diagnostics. However, we can infer the structure based on the error message and the nature of the ARC benchmark this problem likely comes from.\n\n*   **Input/Output Type:** Assumed to be 2D NumPy arrays of integers (grids).\n*   **Dimensions:** Variable. The training examples *look* like 1xN grids, but the error implies multi-row grids were encountered in testing.\n*   **Transformation:** Operates row-by-row independently. Within each row, identifies contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers.\n*   **Block Modification Rule:**\n    *   Blocks of length <= 2: Remain unchanged.\n    *   Blocks of length > 2: The first and last elements remain; the elements in between are set to 0.\n*   **Zero Handling:** Zeros not part of a non-zero block remain unchanged.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"
