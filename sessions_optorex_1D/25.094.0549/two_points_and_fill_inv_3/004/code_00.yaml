Objects:
  - Grid:
      description: A 2D NumPy array of single-digit integers.
      roles: [Input, Output]
  - Row:
      description: A 1D horizontal slice of the Grid.
  - Element:
      description: A single integer cell within the Grid (0-9).
  - Group:
      description: A contiguous horizontal subsequence of identical non-zero Elements within a Row.
      properties:
        - value: The non-zero integer that makes up the group.
        - row_index: The index of the Row containing the group.
        - start_col_index: The starting column index of the group within its Row.
        - end_col_index: The ending column index of the group within its Row.
        - length: The number of elements in the group (end_col_index - start_col_index + 1).

Relationships:
  - An Input Grid is transformed into an Output Grid of the same dimensions.
  - The transformation is applied independently to each Row of the Input Grid.
  - A Group is identified within a Row.
  - The modification rule depends on the `length` property of the Group.

Actions:
  - Iterate_Rows: Process the Input Grid one Row at a time.
  - Identify_Groups_in_Row: For the current Row, scan horizontally to find all Groups, noting their value, start_col_index, end_col_index, and length.
  - Modify_Row: Create a copy of the current Row. For each identified Group in that Row:
      - Condition: Check if the Group's `length` is greater than 2.
      - If True:
          - Modify the copied Row by setting the elements from `start_col_index + 1` up to `end_col_index - 1` (inclusive) to 0.
      - If False:
          - Make no changes to the copied Row for this Group.
  - Assemble_Output: Collect the modified Rows to form the Output Grid.
