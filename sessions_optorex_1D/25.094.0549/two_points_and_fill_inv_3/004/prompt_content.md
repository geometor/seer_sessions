"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of integers. It identifies contiguous groups of 
identical non-zero numbers. If a group's length is greater than 2, only the 
first and last elements of the group are kept in their original positions in 
the output array, and the elements between them are replaced with 0. Groups 
of length 2 or less, and zeros outside of these groups, remain unchanged.
