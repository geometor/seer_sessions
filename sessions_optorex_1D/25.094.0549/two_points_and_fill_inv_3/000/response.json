            "text": "## Perception of Task Elements\n\nThe task involves transforming a 1D sequence of single-digit integers. The input sequences contain blocks (contiguous runs) of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The transformation rule appears to operate specifically on these non-zero blocks. By comparing the input and output sequences across the examples, a pattern emerges:\n\n1.  **Identification of Blocks:** The core operation is identifying contiguous sequences of the *same non-zero* digit.\n2.  **Length Dependency:** The transformation applied to a block depends on its length.\n3.  **Modification Rule:** If a block's length is greater than 2, only the first and last elements of the block are retained in their original positions in the output. All the elements *between* the first and last elements of that block are replaced with 0.\n4.  **Short Blocks:** If a block's length is 2 or less (as seen in `train_1` and `train_4`), the block remains unchanged in the output.\n5.  **Zeros:** Zeros in the input that are not part of the identified non-zero blocks remain unchanged in the output.\n\n## YAML Fact Documentation\n\n"
