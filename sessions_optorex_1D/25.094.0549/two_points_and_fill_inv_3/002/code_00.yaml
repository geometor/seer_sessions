Objects:
  - Sequence:
      description: A 1D NumPy array of single-digit integers.
      roles: [Input, Output]
  - Element:
      description: A single integer within a sequence (0-9).
  - Group:
      description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero Elements within the Input Sequence.
      properties:
        - value: The non-zero integer that makes up the group.
        - start_index: The index of the first element of the group in the Input Sequence.
        - end_index: The index of the last element of the group in the Input Sequence (inclusive).
        - length: The number of elements in the group (end_index - start_index + 1).

Relationships:
  - An Input Sequence (NumPy array) is transformed into an Output Sequence (NumPy array).
  - Groups are identified within the Input Sequence.
  - The transformation rule depends on the `length` property of the identified Groups.

Actions:
  - Identify_Groups: Scan the Input Sequence (NumPy array) to find all Groups, noting their value, start_index, end_index, and length.
  - Modify_Sequence: Create a copy of the Input Sequence (as a NumPy array). For each identified Group:
      - Condition: Check if the Group's `length` is greater than 2.
      - If True:
          - Modify the copied array by setting the slice from `start_index + 1` up to (but not including) `end_index` to 0.
      - If False:
          - Make no changes to the copied array for this Group.
  - Output: Return the modified NumPy array.

Assumptions:
  - The input provided to the transformation function is a 1D NumPy array of integers.
  - The expected output is also a 1D NumPy array of integers.
