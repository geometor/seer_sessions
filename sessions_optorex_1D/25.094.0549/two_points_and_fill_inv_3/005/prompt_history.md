## Perception of Task Elements

The task involves transforming a 1D sequence of single-digit integers. The input sequences contain blocks (contiguous runs) of identical non-zero digits, surrounded by zeros. The transformation rule appears to operate specifically on these non-zero blocks. By comparing the input and output sequences across the examples, a pattern emerges:

1.  **Identification of Blocks:** The core operation is identifying contiguous sequences of the *same non-zero* digit.
2.  **Length Dependency:** The transformation applied to a block depends on its length.
3.  **Modification Rule:** If a block's length is greater than 2, only the first and last elements of the block are retained in their original positions in the output. All the elements *between* the first and last elements of that block are replaced with 0.
4.  **Short Blocks:** If a block's length is 2 or less (as seen in `train_1` and `train_4`), the block remains unchanged in the output.
5.  **Zeros:** Zeros in the input that are not part of the identified non-zero blocks remain unchanged in the output.

      description: A 1D list of single-digit integers.
      roles: [Input, Output]
  - Element:
      description: A single integer within a sequence (0-9).
  - Group:
      description: A contiguous subsequence of identical non-zero Elements within the Input Sequence.
      properties:
        - value: The non-zero integer that makes up the group.
        - start_index: The index of the first element of the group in the Input Sequence.
        - end_index: The index of the last element of the group in the Input Sequence.
        - length: The number of elements in the group (end_index - start_index + 1).

Relationships:
  - An Input Sequence is transformed into an Output Sequence.
  - A Group is identified within the Input Sequence.
  - The transformation rule depends on the `length` property of the Group.

Actions:
  - Identify_Groups: Scan the Input Sequence to find all Groups, noting their value, start_index, end_index, and length.
  - Modify_Sequence: Create a copy of the Input Sequence. For each identified Group:
      - Condition: Check if the Group's `length` is greater than 2.
      - If True:
          - Modify the copied sequence by setting the elements from `start_index + 1` up to `end_index - 1` (inclusive) to 0.
      - If False:
          - Make no changes to the copied sequence for this Group.
  - Output: Return the modified sequence.

## Natural Language Program

1.  Initialize the output sequence as a copy of the input sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to identify all contiguous groups of identical non-zero numbers. For each group found, record its starting index, ending index, and length.
3.  For each identified group:
    a.  Check if the length of the group is greater than 2.
    b.  If the length is greater than 2, then iterate through the indices of the output sequence starting from the index *after* the group's start index up to the index *before* the group's end index. Set the value at each of these indices in the output sequence to 0.
4.  Return the final output sequence.

## General Assessment

The provided Python code failed during execution with the error: "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()". This strongly suggests that the `input_grid` variable, assumed to be a 1D NumPy array (or sequence) based on the initial examples, is actually being treated as or is in fact a 2D NumPy array (a grid) in the test environment. The comparison `if sequence[i] != 0:` in `find_groups_np` works for individual elements, but if `input_grid` itself (or a slice of it) were used in a boolean context elsewhere (e.g., `if input_grid:` or `if some_slice:`), this error would occur.

The transformation logic identified previously (finding contiguous horizontal blocks of identical non-zero numbers and "hollowing out" those longer than 2) appears correct based on the visual structure of the 1-row examples. However, the implementation needs to be adapted to handle 2D grids, likely by applying the transformation logic independently to each row.

**Strategy:**

1.  **Confirm Input Structure:** Assume the inputs are 2D NumPy arrays (grids).
2.  **Adapt Logic:** Modify the approach to iterate through each row of the input grid.
3.  **Apply Row Transformation:** Apply the existing `find_groups_np` and the hollowing logic to each individual row.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Refine the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect the 2D grid structure and row-wise operation.

## Metrics Gathering

Since we don't have the exact inputs that caused the error, we cannot run specific code diagnostics. However, we can infer the structure based on the error message and the nature of the ARC benchmark this problem likely comes from.

*   **Input/Output Type:** Assumed to be 2D NumPy arrays of integers (grids).
*   **Dimensions:** Variable. The training examples *look* like 1xN grids, but the error implies multi-row grids were encountered in testing.
*   **Transformation:** Operates row-by-row independently. Within each row, identifies contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers.
*   **Block Modification Rule:**
    *   Blocks of length <= 2: Remain unchanged.
    *   Blocks of length > 2: The first and last elements remain; the elements in between are set to 0.
*   **Zero Handling:** Zeros not part of a non-zero block remain unchanged.

1.  Initialize the output grid as a copy of the input grid.
2.  Iterate through each row of the input grid, keeping track of the current row index.
3.  For the current row:
    a.  Identify all contiguous horizontal groups of identical non-zero numbers. For each group found, record its starting column index, ending column index, and length.
    b.  For each identified group within the current row:
        i.  Check if the length of the group is greater than 2.
        ii. If the length is greater than 2, then iterate through the column indices from the index *after* the group's start column index up to the index *before* the group's end column index. Set the value at each of these column indices *in the corresponding row of the output grid* to 0.
4.  Return the final output grid.
