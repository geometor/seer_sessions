  - type: input_data
    description: A 1-dimensional NumPy array of single-digit integers.
    properties:
      - element_type: integer
      - contains_zeros: boolean
      - contains_non_zeros: boolean
      - has_blocks_of_identical_non_zeros: boolean
      - block_length: integer (variable)
      - shape: (N,) where N is the sequence length

  - type: output_data
    description: A 1-dimensional NumPy array of single-digit integers, corresponding to the transformed input.
    properties:
      - element_type: integer
      - same_shape_as_input: boolean

  - type: transformation_rule
    description: Modifies blocks of identical non-zero digits within the input array based on block length.
    actions:
      - identify_blocks: Iterate through the array to locate contiguous sequences (slices) of identical digits.
      - check_block_length: Determine the number of elements in each identified block.
      - apply_modification:
          condition: block_digit != 0 AND block_length >= 3
          steps:
            - Keep the first element of the block.
            - Replace the middle (block_length - 2) elements with 0.
            - Keep the last element of the block.
      - preserve_elements:
          condition: block_digit == 0 OR block_length < 3
          steps:
            - Keep the elements in the block unchanged.
    relationships:
      - Zero elements in the input map directly to zero elements in the output at the same position.
      - Non-zero blocks in the input map to potentially modified blocks in the output, preserving overall array length.
