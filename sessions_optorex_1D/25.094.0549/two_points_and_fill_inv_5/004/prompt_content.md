"""
Transforms a 1D NumPy array of single-digit integers.
It identifies contiguous blocks (runs) of identical non-zero digits.
If a run of a non-zero digit has a length of 3 or more, the first and last digits
of the run are kept, and all elements in between are replaced with 0.
Runs of non-zero digits with length 1 or 2, and all runs of 0s, remain unchanged.
The overall length of the array is preserved.
