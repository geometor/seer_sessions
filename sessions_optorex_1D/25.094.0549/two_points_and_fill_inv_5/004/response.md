**General Assessment and Strategy**

The error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` consistently occurs across all examples. This strongly indicates that the input `input_grid` provided to the `transform` function is not a 1D NumPy array as initially assumed, but rather a 2D NumPy array (a grid). The comparisons like `if current_digit == 0:` or `while j < n and input_grid[j] == current_digit:` fail because `current_digit` might be compared against another element or slice, potentially resulting in a boolean array instead of a single True/False value, which standard Python `if` statements cannot handle directly.

The strategy is to:
1.  Confirm the input data structure is indeed a 2D grid.
2.  Adapt the transformation logic to operate on each row of the 2D grid independently. The core rule (modifying runs of identical non-zero digits of length 3 or more) remains the same but will be applied horizontally within each row.
3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this understanding of the data as a 2D grid and the row-wise application of the transformation.

**Metrics and Verification**

Let's verify the structure of the input data. Assuming the space-separated numbers represent rows of a grid.

*   **train_1:** `1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`.
*   **train_2:** `0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0`.
*   **train_3:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3`.
*   **train_4:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1`.
*   **train_5:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0`.
*   **train_6:** `0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0`.
*   **train_7:** `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0`.

All examples seem to be single-row grids (1xN). The previous code failed because even a single row in NumPy is treated as an array, and accessing elements needs careful handling within conditional checks if array operations are involved implicitly or explicitly. However, the core logic seems applicable row-by-row (even if there's only one row). The implementation needs adjustment to handle NumPy array comparisons correctly, perhaps by iterating through elements explicitly or ensuring comparisons yield single booleans. The provided code actually iterates element by element (`input_grid[i]`), so the comparison `input_grid[j] == current_digit` should yield a single boolean if `current_digit` is also a single element. The error might stem from how `input_grid` is passed or interpreted by the testing environment (perhaps it's nested like `[[1, 1, ...]]` making `input_grid[i]` itself an array).

Let's refine the assumption: The input is likely treated as a 2D grid, even if it only has one row in these examples. The code needs to iterate through each row and apply the 1D logic to that row.

**Updated YAML Facts**


```yaml
task_elements:
  - type: input_data
    description: A 2D grid of single-digit integers. In the provided examples, the grids have only one row.
    properties:
      - structure: 2D grid (NumPy array)
      - cell_values: single digits (0-9)
      - contains_zeros: boolean
      - contains_non_zeros: boolean

  - type: output_data
    description: A 2D grid of single-digit integers with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    properties:
      - structure: 2D grid (NumPy array)
      - same_dimensions_as_input: boolean

  - type: transformation_rule
    description: Applies a modification rule independently to each row of the input grid. The rule operates on contiguous horizontal blocks (runs) of identical non-zero digits within a row.
    scope: row-wise
    actions:
      - iterate_rows: Process each row of the input grid.
      - identify_horizontal_blocks: Within a row, locate contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits.
      - check_block_length: Determine the number of digits in each identified horizontal block.
      - apply_modification:
          condition: block_value != 0 AND block_length >= 3
          steps:
            - Keep the first digit of the block in its original position.
            - Replace the middle (block_length - 2) digits with 0.
            - Keep the last digit of the block in its original position.
      - preserve_elements:
          condition: block_value == 0 OR (block_value != 0 AND block_length < 3)
          steps:
            - Keep all digits within the block unchanged in their original positions.
    relationships:
      - The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.
      - The transformation is applied independently to each row.
      - Zeros within a row remain zeros.
      - Non-zero blocks within a row are modified based only on their horizontal length and value.
```


**Updated Natural Language Program**

1.  Receive the input as a 2D grid of digits.
2.  Create a new output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, initially possibly filled with a placeholder or copied from the input.
3.  Iterate through each row of the input grid.
4.  For the current row:
    a.  Initialize an index `i` to 0.
    b.  While `i` is less than the width of the row:
        i.   Get the digit value `current_digit` at index `i`.
        ii.  Find the end index `j` of the contiguous horizontal block of identical digits starting at `i`.
        iii. Calculate the length of the block: `block_length = j - i`.
        iv.  If `current_digit` is non-zero and `block_length` is 3 or greater:
            1.  Keep the digit at index `i` in the output row (`output_row[i] = current_digit`).
            2.  Set the digits from index `i + 1` to `j - 2` in the output row to 0 (`output_row[k] = 0` for `k` from `i+1` to `j-2`).
            3.  Keep the digit at index `j - 1` in the output row (`output_row[j-1] = current_digit`).
        v.   Else (if `current_digit` is 0 or `block_length` is less than 3):
            1.  Copy the entire block from the input row (from index `i` to `j-1`) to the corresponding positions in the output row.
        vi.  Update the index `i` to `j` to move to the start of the next block.
5.  After processing all rows, return the completed output grid.
