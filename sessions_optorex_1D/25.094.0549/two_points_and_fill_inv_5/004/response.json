            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy**\n\nThe error message `The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()` consistently occurs across all examples. This strongly indicates that the input `input_grid` provided to the `transform` function is not a 1D NumPy array as initially assumed, but rather a 2D NumPy array (a grid). The comparisons like `if current_digit == 0:` or `while j < n and input_grid[j] == current_digit:` fail because `current_digit` might be compared against another element or slice, potentially resulting in a boolean array instead of a single True/False value, which standard Python `if` statements cannot handle directly.\n\nThe strategy is to:\n1.  Confirm the input data structure is indeed a 2D grid.\n2.  Adapt the transformation logic to operate on each row of the 2D grid independently. The core rule (modifying runs of identical non-zero digits of length 3 or more) remains the same but will be applied horizontally within each row.\n3.  Update the YAML facts and Natural Language Program to reflect this understanding of the data as a 2D grid and the row-wise application of the transformation.\n\n**Metrics and Verification**\n\nLet's verify the structure of the input data. Assuming the space-separated numbers represent rows of a grid.\n\n*   **train_1:** `1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`.\n*   **train_2:** `0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0`.\n*   **train_3:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3`.\n*   **train_4:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1`.\n*   **train_5:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0`.\n*   **train_6:** `0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0`.\n*   **train_7:** `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0` -> Looks like a 1x12 grid. Output: `9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0`.\n\nAll examples seem to be single-row grids (1xN). The previous code failed because even a single row in NumPy is treated as an array, and accessing elements needs careful handling within conditional checks if array operations are involved implicitly or explicitly. However, the core logic seems applicable row-by-row (even if there's only one row). The implementation needs adjustment to handle NumPy array comparisons correctly, perhaps by iterating through elements explicitly or ensuring comparisons yield single booleans. The provided code actually iterates element by element (`input_grid[i]`), so the comparison `input_grid[j] == current_digit` should yield a single boolean if `current_digit` is also a single element. The error might stem from how `input_grid` is passed or interpreted by the testing environment (perhaps it's nested like `[[1, 1, ...]]` making `input_grid[i]` itself an array).\n\nLet's refine the assumption: The input is likely treated as a 2D grid, even if it only has one row in these examples. The code needs to iterate through each row and apply the 1D logic to that row.\n\n**Updated YAML Facts**\n\n"
