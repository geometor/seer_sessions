task_elements:
  - type: input_data
    description: A 2D grid of single-digit integers. In the provided examples, the grids have only one row.
    properties:
      - structure: 2D grid (NumPy array)
      - cell_values: single digits (0-9)
      - contains_zeros: boolean
      - contains_non_zeros: boolean

  - type: output_data
    description: A 2D grid of single-digit integers with the same dimensions as the input grid.
    properties:
      - structure: 2D grid (NumPy array)
      - same_dimensions_as_input: boolean

  - type: transformation_rule
    description: Applies a modification rule independently to each row of the input grid. The rule operates on contiguous horizontal blocks (runs) of identical non-zero digits within a row.
    scope: row-wise
    actions:
      - iterate_rows: Process each row of the input grid.
      - identify_horizontal_blocks: Within a row, locate contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits.
      - check_block_length: Determine the number of digits in each identified horizontal block.
      - apply_modification:
          condition: block_value != 0 AND block_length >= 3
          steps:
            - Keep the first digit of the block in its original position.
            - Replace the middle (block_length - 2) digits with 0.
            - Keep the last digit of the block in its original position.
      - preserve_elements:
          condition: block_value == 0 OR (block_value != 0 AND block_length < 3)
          steps:
            - Keep all digits within the block unchanged in their original positions.
    relationships:
      - The transformation preserves the grid dimensions.
      - The transformation is applied independently to each row.
      - Zeros within a row remain zeros.
      - Non-zero blocks within a row are modified based only on their horizontal length and value.
