  - type: input_data
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers, represented as space-separated strings.
    properties:
      - contains_zeros: boolean
      - contains_non_zeros: boolean
      - has_blocks_of_identical_non_zeros: boolean
      - block_length: integer (variable)

  - type: output_data
    description: A sequence of single-digit integers, corresponding to the transformed input.
    properties:
      - same_length_as_input: boolean

  - type: transformation_rule
    description: Modifies blocks of identical non-zero digits based on block length.
    actions:
      - identify_blocks: Locate contiguous sequences of identical non-zero digits.
      - check_block_length: Determine the number of digits in each identified block.
      - apply_modification:
          condition: block_length >= 3
          steps:
            - Keep the first digit of the block.
            - Replace the middle (block_length - 2) digits with '0'.
            - Keep the last digit of the block.
      - preserve_elements:
          condition: digit is '0' OR block_length < 3
          steps:
            - Keep the digit or the block unchanged.
    relationships:
      - Zeros in the input map directly to zeros in the output at the same position.
      - Non-zero blocks in the input map to potentially modified blocks in the output, preserving overall sequence length.
