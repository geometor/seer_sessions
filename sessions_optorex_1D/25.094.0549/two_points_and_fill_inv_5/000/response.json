The output sequence also consists of digits separated by spaces, maintaining the same overall length as the input.\n\nThe core transformation logic appears to operate on contiguous blocks (runs) of identical non-zero digits within the input sequence.\n\n-   Zero digits ('0') in the input seem to remain unchanged in the output.\n-   Runs of identical non-zero digits are treated differently based on their length:\n    -   If a run has a length of 1 or 2, it remains unchanged in the output (e.g., `1 1` in train\\_4).\n    -   If a run has a length of 3 or more, it is modified: the first digit and the last digit of the run are kept, while all the digits in between are replaced with '0's. The number of '0's inserted is equal to the length of the original run minus 2. (e.g., `1 1 1 1` becomes `1 0 0 1`, `3 3 3 3 3` becomes `3 0 0 0 3`).\n-   The transformation applies independently to each such block within the sequence.\n\n**Facts:**\n\n"
