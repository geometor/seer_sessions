            "text": "## General Assessment\n\nThe provided Python code correctly implements the observed logic: find contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers, and if a block's length exceeds two, replace its interior elements with zeros while preserving the first and last elements. However, the code fails on all examples with a `TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number, not 'list'`.\n\nThis error consistently occurs during the input processing phase, specifically within the list comprehensions attempting to convert input elements to `int`: `[int(x) for x in input_grid.tolist()]` or `[int(x) for x in input_grid]` or `[int(x) for x in list(input_grid)]`. This strongly suggests that the `input_grid` being passed to the `transform` function is not a simple 1D list or array of numbers as initially assumed from the visual representation of the examples. Instead, it's likely a nested structure, probably a list containing a single inner list (e.g., `[[0, 0, 0, ...]]`), which represents a 1xN grid or array. The code attempts to call `int()` on the inner list itself, leading to the `TypeError`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe strategy is to modify the input handling part of the `transform` function to correctly extract the 1D sequence from the likely nested input structure before applying the transformation logic. The core block identification and modification logic appears sound and does not need changing based on the current errors.\n\n## Metrics\n\n*   **Total Examples:** 7 Training, 1 Test (inferred from error messages) = 8 Total\n*   **Successful Examples:** 0\n*   **Failed Examples:** 8\n*   **Common Error Type:** `TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number, not 'list'` occurred in all 8 failed examples.\n*   **Error Location:** Input processing/type conversion block within the `transform` function.\n\n*No code execution is needed to gather these metrics, as they are directly derived from the provided error report.*\n\n## Facts\n\n"
