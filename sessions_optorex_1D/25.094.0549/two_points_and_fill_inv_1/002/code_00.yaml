objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list_of_integers # Fundamentally a sequence, robust code handles list or numpy array input
    description: Represents both the input and output data structure (1D).
  - name: element
    type: integer
    description: Individual number within the sequence. Can be 0 or non-zero.
  - name: block
    type: contiguous_subsequence
    description: A run of identical, consecutive non-zero elements within the sequence.
properties:
  - object: block
    name: value
    type: integer
    description: The non-zero integer value repeated within the block.
  - object: block
    name: length
    type: integer
    description: The number of elements in the block.
  - object: block
    name: start_index
    type: integer
    description: The index of the first element of the block in the main sequence.
  - object: block
    name: end_index
    type: integer
    description: The index of the last element of the block in the main sequence.
actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Scan the input sequence to find all contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers.
  - name: modify_block_interior
    description: Change elements within an identified block based on its length.
  - name: preserve_element
    description: Keep an element unchanged if it is 0 or part of a block not meeting modification criteria.
relationships:
  - type: condition
    description: The modification is applied only to blocks of non-zero numbers with length greater than 2.
    condition: block.value != 0 and block.length > 2
    action: Replace elements between the first and last element of the block (exclusive) with 0.
  - type: condition
    description: If a block's length is 2 or less, or if an element is 0, it remains unchanged.
    condition: block.length <= 2 or element.value == 0
    action: Preserve the element's original value.
