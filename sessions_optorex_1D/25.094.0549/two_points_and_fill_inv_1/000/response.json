The input sequences consist of blocks of identical numbers, often separated or surrounded by zeros. The transformation primarily affects contiguous blocks of identical *non-zero* numbers. Zeros seem to act as delimiters or background elements that remain unchanged unless they are part of the modification applied to the non-zero blocks. The core operation targets the *interior* elements of these non-zero blocks, specifically when the block's length exceeds two.\n\n## Facts\n\n"
