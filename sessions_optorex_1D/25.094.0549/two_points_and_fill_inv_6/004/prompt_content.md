from typing import List 

"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
If a block's length is greater than 2, only the first and last elements of the block 
are kept, and the elements between them are changed to 0. Blocks of length 1 or 2, 
and all zero elements, remain unchanged.

def transform(input_grid: np.ndarray) -> List[int]:
