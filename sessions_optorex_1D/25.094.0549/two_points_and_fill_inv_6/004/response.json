            "text": "**General Assessment:**\n\nThe previous code attempt failed consistently across all examples with the error: `ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()`. This strongly indicates that the input `input_grid`, although visually represented as a single sequence in the problem description, is being passed to the `transform` function as a 2D NumPy array (likely with shape 1xN or Nx1).\n\nThe error arises because the previous code attempted to convert this 2D array directly to a Python list using `list(input_grid)`. When applied to a 2D NumPy array of shape (1, N), this results in a list containing a single element: the NumPy array corresponding to the first (and only) row `[array([e1, e2, ...])]`. Subsequent code then attempted to access and compare elements like `input_list[i]`, which retrieved the entire inner array, leading to comparisons involving multiple boolean values (e.g., `array([0, 0, ...]) == 0` results in `array([True, True, ...])`), which cannot be evaluated directly in a standard `if` condition.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe core transformation logic identified previously (find contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers, if block length > 2, zero out the middle elements) appears correct based on the input/output pairs. The fix involves correctly handling the input NumPy array format.\n\n1.  **Input Handling:** Modify the code to first check the dimensions of the input `input_grid`.\n    *   If it's 2D with shape (1, N), extract the first row `input_grid[0]` as the 1D sequence to process.\n    *   If it's 2D with shape (N, 1), extract the first column `input_grid[:, 0]` as the 1D sequence.\n    *   If it's already 1D (shape (N,)), use it directly.\n2.  **Conversion:** Convert the extracted 1D NumPy array sequence to a Python list using `.tolist()` for easier iteration and element access.\n3.  **Apply Logic:** Apply the previously defined block-finding and modification logic to this Python list.\n4.  **Return Format:** The function signature requires returning a `List[int]`, so the final modified Python list is the correct output format.\n\n**Metrics and Verification:**\n\nBased on the error messages and typical ARC framework behavior, the inputs are NumPy arrays. Let's confirm the shape assumption and the effect of `list()` conversion using `train_2` as an example.\n\n*   **Input (train\\_2):** `0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n*   **Expected Output (train\\_2):** `0 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n*   **Simulated NumPy Input:** `np.array([[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]])`\n*   **Shape:** (1, 12)\n*   **`list(input)`:** `[array([0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])]` - A list containing one NumPy array.\n*   **Correct 1D Extraction:** `input_grid[0].tolist()` -> `[0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n*   **Block Identification:** A block of '6' from index 1 to 5 (length 5).\n*   **Rule Application:** Length 5 > 2. Keep element at index 1 (6), keep element at index 5 (6). Change elements at indices 2, 3, 4 to 0.\n*   **Resulting List:** `[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` - Matches expected output.\n\nThis confirms the analysis and the refined strategy.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
