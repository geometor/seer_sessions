objects:
  - name: input_grid
    type: numpy.ndarray
    properties:
      - shape: Can be 1D (N,), 2D (1, N), or 2D (N, 1). Contains the initial sequence.
      - elements: Integers (digits 0-9)
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - description: A 1D list of integers extracted from the input_grid. This is the primary structure processed.
      - elements: list of integers (digits 0-9)
      - length: integer (number of elements)
  - name: block
    type: contiguous subsequence within the sequence
    properties:
      - elements: identical non-zero integers
      - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence
      - length: integer (number of elements in the block)
      - value: the non-zero integer comprising the block
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - index: position within the sequence

actions:
  - name: extract_sequence
    description: Extract the 1D sequence of integers from the potentially 2D input_grid.
    inputs: input_grid
    outputs: sequence (list of integers)
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Scan the sequence to find contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
    inputs: sequence
    outputs: list_of_blocks (each with value, start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: process_blocks
    description: Iterate through identified blocks and modify a copy of the sequence based on block length.
    inputs: sequence, list_of_blocks
    outputs: output_sequence (list of integers)
    sub_actions:
      - name: modify_long_block
        condition: If block.length > 2
        effect: In the output_sequence copy, set elements from block.start_index + 1 to block.end_index - 1 to 0. The start and end elements remain unchanged.
      - name: preserve_short_block
        condition: If block.length <= 2
        effect: Corresponding elements in the output_sequence copy remain unchanged from the original sequence.
      - name: preserve_zeros
        effect: Elements with value 0 in the original sequence inherently remain unchanged in the output copy unless part of a block modification.

relationships:
  - The output_sequence has the same length as the extracted input sequence.
  - The transformation focuses on non-zero blocks; zero elements outside blocks are preserved.
  - The modification rule depends solely on the block's length property.
  - Blocks are processed based on their occurrence in the sequence.
