Non-zero digits (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 in the examples) appear in contiguous blocks.\n4.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action involves modifying these contiguous blocks of non-zero digits. Elements with the value '0' seem unaffected and act as separators or background.\n5.  **Block Modification Rule:**\n    *   Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged (e.g., `[3, 3]` in train\\_1).\n    *   Blocks of length 3 or more are modified: only the first and last elements of the block retain their original non-zero value, while all elements *between* the first and last are changed to '0'. (e.g., `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` becomes `[6, 0, 0, 0, 6]` in train\\_2; `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` becomes `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` in train\\_3).\n6.  **Positional Integrity:** The positions of the modified blocks and the '0' elements are maintained relative to the overall sequence structure. The transformation happens \"in-place\" conceptually.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
