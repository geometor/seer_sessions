Okay, I will analyze the provided examples and generate the requested deliverables.

**Perception of Task Elements:**

1.  **Input/Output Structure:** Both input and output are single lists (or sequences) of integers.
2.  **Sequence Length:** The length of the input sequence is consistently 12, and the output sequence always matches the input length.
3.  **Element Values:** The sequences contain single digits, with '0' appearing frequently. Non-zero digits (1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 in the examples) appear in contiguous blocks.
4.  **Core Transformation:** The primary action involves modifying these contiguous blocks of non-zero digits. Elements with the value '0' seem unaffected and act as separators or background.
5.  **Block Modification Rule:**
    *   Blocks of length 1 or 2 remain unchanged (e.g., `[3, 3]` in train\_1).
    *   Blocks of length 3 or more are modified: only the first and last elements of the block retain their original non-zero value, while all elements *between* the first and last are changed to '0'. (e.g., `[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]` becomes `[6, 0, 0, 0, 6]` in train\_2; `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` becomes `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` in train\_3).
6.  **Positional Integrity:** The positions of the modified blocks and the '0' elements are maintained relative to the overall sequence structure. The transformation happens "in-place" conceptually.

**YAML Fact Documentation:**


```yaml
objects:
  - name: sequence
    type: list
    properties:
      - elements: list of integers (digits 0-9)
      - length: integer (consistently 12 in examples)
  - name: block
    type: contiguous subsequence
    properties:
      - elements: identical non-zero integers
      - location: defined by start and end index within the sequence
      - length: integer (number of elements in the block)
      - value: the non-zero integer comprising the block
  - name: element
    type: integer
    properties:
      - value: 0-9
      - index: position within the sequence

actions:
  - name: identify_blocks
    description: Scan the input sequence to find contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: list_of_blocks (each with value, start_index, end_index, length)
  - name: modify_block
    description: Change elements within a block based on its length.
    inputs: block, output_sequence
    outputs: modified_output_sequence
    condition: If block.length > 2
    effect: Sets elements in output_sequence from block.start_index + 1 to block.end_index - 1 to 0.
  - name: preserve_block
    description: Keep block elements unchanged.
    inputs: block
    condition: If block.length <= 2
    effect: No change to corresponding elements in the output_sequence.
  - name: preserve_zeros
    description: Ensure elements with value 0 remain 0.
    inputs: input_sequence
    outputs: output_sequence
    effect: Elements with value 0 are copied directly to the output.

relationships:
  - input_sequence and output_sequence have the same length.
  - The transformation focuses on non-zero blocks; zero elements are inherently preserved.
  - The modification rule (modify_block vs. preserve_block) depends solely on the block's length property.
  - Blocks are processed independently.
```


**Natural Language Program:**

1.  Start with the input sequence. Create a new sequence, initially identical to the input, which will become the output sequence.
2.  Iterate through the input sequence to locate contiguous blocks where the elements consist of the same non-zero digit. For each block found, determine its starting index, ending index, and length.
3.  For every identified block:
    a.  Check the length of the block.
    b.  If the length is greater than 2:
        i.  In the output sequence, keep the element at the block's starting index unchanged.
        ii. In the output sequence, keep the element at the block's ending index unchanged.
        iii. In the output sequence, change all elements located *between* the starting index and the ending index (i.e., from index `start_index + 1` up to `end_index - 1`) to the value 0.
    c.  If the length of the block is 2 or less, make no changes to the corresponding elements in the output sequence (they remain as they were copied from the input).
4.  After processing all blocks, the resulting sequence is the final output.
```python
import re

"""
Transforms a sequence of digits based on contiguous blocks of identical non-zero digits.
If a block's length is greater than 2, only the first and last elements of the block 
are kept, and the elements between them are changed to 0. Blocks of length 1 or 2, 
and all zero elements, remain unchanged.
