            "text": "**General Assessment and Strategy:**\n\nThe initial analysis correctly identified the core transformation logic: identifying contiguous blocks of identical non-zero numbers and modifying them based on length (keeping only endpoints if length > 2, otherwise leaving unchanged). The failure during execution stemmed from a mismatch in the assumed input data type. The code expected a space-separated string, while the execution environment provided a NumPy array.\n\nThe strategy is to correct the understanding of the input format. The input should be treated as a sequence (list or array) of integers directly, eliminating the need for string parsing (`split()`). The fundamental logic of iterating, finding blocks, checking lengths, and modifying the sequence remains valid.\n\n**Metrics and Observations:**\n\n*   **Input Data Type:** The execution errors (`AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'split'`) definitively show that the input `transform` function receives is a NumPy array, not a string.\n*   **Output Data Type:** The expected output format in the examples is also a sequence of integers (represented as space-separated strings for display). The function should return a compatible format, likely a list or NumPy array of integers.\n*   **Sequence Length:** Consistently 12 in all training examples.\n*   **Element Values:** Integers, primarily 0 and single non-zero digits forming blocks.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** Remains consistent across examples. Blocks of length > 2 have their interior elements set to 0. Blocks of length <= 2 and individual 0 elements are unchanged.\n\n**YAML Fact Documentation:**\n\n"
