**1. General Assessment and Strategy**

*   **Assessment:** The provided code failed execution on all examples due to a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This indicates the testing framework supplied the `transform` function with NumPy arrays, while the function's internal logic (specifically `find_pivot_index` using `sequence.index(pivot_value)`) expected a standard Python list. The core transformation logic (identifying '2', iteratively shifting non-zero elements across pairs of zeros towards '2') was not actually tested due to this type mismatch.
*   **Strategy:**
    1.  **Assume List Input:** Modify the understanding and documentation (YAML, natural language program) to explicitly state that the transformation operates on a *list* of integers. The core function should be designed to accept and return lists. If the execution environment provides NumPy arrays, a wrapper or conversion step *outside* the core logic would be needed, but the fundamental algorithm should work with list semantics.
    2.  **Verify Logic:** Re-confirm the shifting logic based on the initial observations and traces (as performed in the thought process). The iterative approach (using `while True` loops until no swaps occur in a pass) and the specific direction of scanning within each pass (right-to-left for the left side, left-to-right for the right side) appear correct for handling cascading shifts and preserving the relative order of blocks, based on examples like `train_3` and `train_7`.
    3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the list-based processing, the fixed pivot '2', the specific shift condition (non-zero element, two adjacent zeros towards the pivot), the iterative nature, and the processing directions.

**2. Metrics**

No code execution is needed to diagnose the `TypeError`. The error message itself is the primary metric, indicating a type incompatibility. Re-analysis of the examples confirms:
*   All inputs/outputs are sequences of 12 integers.
*   '2' appears exactly once in each input and output, retaining its original index.
*   Shifts only occur for non-zero numbers.
*   The condition for shifting involves jumping over exactly two consecutive '0's towards the '2'.
*   Elements at `idx2-1`, `idx2+1`, `idx2-2`, `idx2+2` do not seem to initiate a shift based on the rule (require indices `i+2 < idx2` or `i-2 > idx2`).
*   The process must be iterative to handle chain reactions (e.g., `train_3`).

**3. Facts (YAML)**


```yaml
Task: Gravitational Shift towards Pivot '2'

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Properties:
    - Contains exactly one instance of the integer 2 (pivot).
    - Contains other non-negative integers, including 0.
    - Fixed length (12 in examples).

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as input.
    - Pivot '2' remains at its original index.
    - Other non-zero elements may have shifted position relative to '2'.
    - Zeroes are effectively "empty space" that elements can move into.

Transformation:
  Core Object: The list of integers.
  Pivot Element: The integer '2'. Its index (`idx2`) divides the list into a left side (indices `< idx2`) and a right side (indices `> idx2`).
  Action: Iterative Shifting
  Rules:
    - Left Side Processing (Indices `i` from `idx2 - 3` down to `0`):
        - Condition: If `list[i]` is non-zero AND `list[i+1]` is 0 AND `list[i+2]` is 0.
        - Action: Swap `list[i]` and `list[i+2]` (shift right by 2).
        - Iteration: Repeat passes over the left side (indices `idx2-3` down to `0`) until a full pass results in no swaps.
    - Right Side Processing (Indices `i` from `idx2 + 3` up to `n-1`):
        - Condition: If `list[i]` is non-zero AND `list[i-1]` is 0 AND `list[i-2]` is 0.
        - Action: Swap `list[i]` and `list[i-2]` (shift left by 2).
        - Iteration: Repeat passes over the right side (indices `idx2+3` up to `n-1`) until a full pass results in no swaps.
  Constraint: The pivot '2' never moves. Elements immediately adjacent to '2' (at `idx2-1`, `idx2+1`) or separated by one zero do not meet the shift conditions.
  Stability: The process terminates when no more elements can be shifted according to the rules on either side.
```


**4. Natural Language Program**

1.  Accept an input list of integers.
2.  Identify the index (`idx2`) of the unique element '2' in the list. This index remains fixed.
3.  Create a mutable copy of the input list to store the result.
4.  **Process the Left Side (elements before '2'):**
    *   Repeatedly perform the following pass until no changes are made in a full pass:
        *   Iterate through the indices `i` from `idx2 - 3` down to `0`.
        *   If the element at index `i` is non-zero, and the elements at `i+1` and `i+2` are both zero, swap the elements at `i` and `i+2` (moving the non-zero element two steps to the right, closer to '2'). Mark that a change occurred in this pass.
5.  **Process the Right Side (elements after '2'):**
    *   Repeatedly perform the following pass until no changes are made in a full pass:
        *   Iterate through the indices `i` from `idx2 + 3` up to the end of the list.
        *   If the element at index `i` is non-zero, and the elements at `i-1` and `i-2` are both zero, swap the elements at `i` and `i-2` (moving the non-zero element two steps to the left, closer to '2'). Mark that a change occurred in this pass.
6.  Return the modified list.
