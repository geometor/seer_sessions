Task: Gravitational Shift towards Pivot '2'

Input:
  Type: List of Integers
  Properties:
    - Contains exactly one instance of the integer 2 (pivot).
    - Contains other non-negative integers, including 0.
    - Fixed length (12 in examples).

Output:
  Type: List of Integers
  Properties:
    - Same length as input.
    - Pivot '2' remains at its original index.
    - Other non-zero elements may have shifted position relative to '2'.
    - Zeroes are effectively "empty space" that elements can move into.

Transformation:
  Core Object: The list of integers.
  Pivot Element: The integer '2'. Its index (`idx2`) divides the list into a left side (indices `< idx2`) and a right side (indices `> idx2`).
  Action: Iterative Shifting
  Rules:
    - Left Side Processing (Indices `i` from `idx2 - 3` down to `0`):
        - Condition: If `list[i]` is non-zero AND `list[i+1]` is 0 AND `list[i+2]` is 0.
        - Action: Swap `list[i]` and `list[i+2]` (shift right by 2).
        - Iteration: Repeat passes over the left side (indices `idx2-3` down to `0`) until a full pass results in no swaps.
    - Right Side Processing (Indices `i` from `idx2 + 3` up to `n-1`):
        - Condition: If `list[i]` is non-zero AND `list[i-1]` is 0 AND `list[i-2]` is 0.
        - Action: Swap `list[i]` and `list[i-2]` (shift left by 2).
        - Iteration: Repeat passes over the right side (indices `idx2+3` up to `n-1`) until a full pass results in no swaps.
  Constraint: The pivot '2' never moves. Elements immediately adjacent to '2' (at `idx2-1`, `idx2+1`) or separated by one zero do not meet the shift conditions.
  Stability: The process terminates when no more elements can be shifted according to the rules on either side.
