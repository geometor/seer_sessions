General Assessment and Strategy**\n\n*   **Assessment:** The provided code failed execution on all examples due to a `TypeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'index'`. This indicates the testing framework supplied the `transform` function with NumPy arrays, while the function's internal logic (specifically `find_pivot_index` using `sequence.index(pivot_value)`) expected a standard Python list. The core transformation logic (identifying '2', iteratively shifting non-zero elements across pairs of zeros towards '2') was not actually tested due to this type mismatch.\n*   **Strategy:**\n    1.  **Assume List Input:** Modify the understanding and documentation (YAML, natural language program) to explicitly state that the transformation operates on a *list* of integers. The core function should be designed to accept and return lists. If the execution environment provides NumPy arrays, a wrapper or conversion step *outside* the core logic would be needed, but the fundamental algorithm should work with list semantics.\n    2.  **Verify Logic:** Re-confirm the shifting logic based on the initial observations and traces (as performed in the thought process). The iterative approach (using `while True` loops until no swaps occur in a pass) and the specific direction of scanning within each pass (right-to-left for the left side, left-to-right for the right side) appear correct for handling cascading shifts and preserving the relative order of blocks, based on examples like `train_3` and `train_7`.\n    3.  **Refine Documentation:** Update the YAML facts and natural language program to accurately reflect the list-based processing, the fixed pivot '2', the specific shift condition (non-zero element, two adjacent zeros towards the pivot), the iterative nature, and the processing directions.\n\n**2. Metrics**\n\nNo code execution is needed to diagnose the `TypeError`. The error message itself is the primary metric, indicating a type incompatibility. Re-analysis of the examples confirms:\n*   All inputs/outputs are sequences of 12 integers.\n*   '2' appears exactly once in each input and output, retaining its original index.\n*   Shifts only occur for non-zero numbers.\n*   The condition for shifting involves jumping over exactly two consecutive '0's towards the '2'.\n*   Elements at `idx2-1`, `idx2+1`, `idx2-2`, `idx2+2` do not seem to initiate a shift based on the rule (require indices `i+2 < idx2` or `i-2 > idx2`).\n*   The process must be iterative to handle chain reactions (e.g., `train_3`).\n\n**3. Facts (YAML)**\n\n"
